May Çré Kåñëa Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who dispelled the darkness
of the earth by distributing His own name; who is increasing thebliss of the lotus-like bhaktas ; who is the storehouse of the nectar
of prema ; and who is the bestower of unnata-ujjvala-rasa , which is
the most elevated relationship of divine conjugal love, performHis playful pastimes in my heart. Although I am ignorant, byfollowing the conclusions of Çré Gauräìga-Sundara, the crest-jewel of all sannyäsés , and by deliberating on the thoughts
expressed by the previous Vaiñëava äcäryas , I have become greedy
to taste a drop of nectar in the form of the Gétä.  Therefore, saintly
persons should forgive this surrendered soul.
The Supreme Absolute Truth, parabrahma Çré Kåñëa, whose
lotus feet are the ultimate objective of all devotion and çästra ,
appeared in His original human-like form as Çré Vasudeva-nandana, the son of Çré Vasudeva, in Çré Gopäla-puré. Al-though He is adhokñaja , supremely inconceivable, beyond the
cognition of material senses, He nevertheless became visibleÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !3
to the eyes of common men through the medium of His
yogamäyä  potency. He imparted the instructions of Bhagavad-
gétä, thus delivering the jévas of this world who were drown-
ing in the ocean of birth and death. He submerged them inthe great ocean of prema  by bestowing upon them a taste of
the sweetness of His beauty ( saundarya-mädhuryä ) and other
qualities. He appeared in this world, being bound by Hispromise to protect the saintly persons and annihilate theasuras . But on the pretext of removing the burden of the
earth, He in fact awarded supreme protection in the form ofmukti (liberation) to miscreants, to those who were antago-
nistic towards Him and to all those jévas drowning in this
vast ocean of material existence which is compared toKumbhépäka-naraka, a hellish planet where sinful personsare cooked in boiling oil.
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa instructed Bhagavad-gétä  so that even
after His disappearance, baddha-jévas , conditioned souls, who
have been influenced by ignorance since time immemorial
and completely bound by lamentation, illusion and so forth,
could be delivered. Another purpose was to uphold His glo-
ries which are found in the çästra  and sung by the munis.  He
directed these instructions of Bhagavad-gétä  to His very dear
associate, priya-parikara  Arjuna, who had voluntarily ac-
cepted a veil of lamentation and illusion.
This Gétä  has three divisions: karma-yoga , jïäna-yoga  and
bhakti-yoga . The eighteen chapters of Bhagavad-gétä  are
blessed with the purport of the entire Vedas  which manifest
as eighteen types of knowledge. Thus Çré Kåñëa reveals the
parama-puruñärtha or supreme objective. Niñkäma-karma-
yoga, working without attachment to the fruits of ones pre-
scribed duties, is described in the first six chapters, and jïäna-
yoga  (acquiring union through knowledge) in the last six
chapters. The six chapters placed between them are more
confidential, describing bhakti-yoga , which is more rarely1! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 4
attained than either  karma-yoga  or jïäna-yoga. Bhakti  is the
very life of karma  and jïäna . Without bhakti , karma  and
jïäna  are fruitless. Therefore, they are partially successful
only when they are mixed with bhakti .
Bhakti  is of two types: kevalä  (exclusive) and pradhäné-bhütä
(with bhakti predominating). Kevala-bhakti , being independent
and supremely powerful, does not need any assistance fromkarma  and jïäna . Therefore, it is known as parama-prabalä
(supremely powerful), akiïcanä  (whereby Kåñëa is ones only
possession), ananyä  (unalloyed), and so on. On the other hand,
pradhäné-bhütä-bhakti  remains mixed with karma  and jïäna.
This will be examined later in more detail.
To explain the nature of Arjunas lamentation and illusion,
the speaker of the Mahäbhärata , Çré Vaiçampäyana, a disciple
of Vyäsadeva, recited the Bhéñma-parva  section to his listener,
Janamejaya, by beginning with dhåtaräñöra uväca . Dhåtaräñöra
asked Saïjaya, O Saïjaya, what did my sons and the sons
of Päëòu do, having assembled at Kurukñetra, desiring to
fight? Here a question arises. Dhåtaräñöra has mentioned
that his sons and the Päëòavas have assembled with the sole
purpose of fighting, so it is certain that they will fight. What,
then, is his intention in asking, What did they do? In response
to this, Dhåtaräñöra has used the words dharma-kñetre , the land
of dharma . In the çruti it is said: kurukñetraà deva-yajanam.
Kurukñetra is the sacrificial arena of the devas.  Therefore,
this land is famous as that which nourishes dharma . Thus, by
the influence of association with this land, the anger of
adharmika (irreligious) persons like Duryodhana and others
can be subdued and they may become inclined to f ollow and
accept dharma . The Päëòavas are already dharmika  by na-
ture. The influence of Kurukñetra may arouse the faculty of
discrimination when they take into consideration that themassacre of ones own relatives is improper. Thus both parties
may agree to a peaceful settlement. Outwardly DhåtaräñöraÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !5
is pretending that he will be happy with a peace treaty, but
internally he is feeling great dissatisfaction. He considers that,if they negotiate a truce, the presence of the Päëòavas will
continue to remain an impediment for his sons. Dhåtaräñöra
thinks, The warriors on my side, like Bhéñma, Droëa and
others cannot be conquered, even by Arjuna. Therefore, since
our victory is certain, it will be beneficial to fight. These
internal sentiments of Dhåtaräñöra, however, are indiscern-
ible to others.
Here, by the component kñetra  in the word dharma-kñetre ,
Sarasvaté-devé is indicating a special meaning for dharma ;
Yudhiñöhira, the incarnation of dharma,  and his associates
are like plants of rice, and their maintainer, Bhagavän Çré
Kåñëa, is like a farmer. The various kinds of assistance given
by Kåñëa to the Päëòavas are likened to watering the crop
and making a causeway around the field. The Kauravas,
headed by Duryodhana, are like the çyämä  (blackish) weeds
which grow in the rice field. This indicates that as the çyämä
weeds are uprooted from the rice field, similarly Duryodhana,
along with the other Kauravas, will be uprooted from this
dharma-kñetra , land of dharma .

Because he illuminates the path of bhakti  for everyone ( viçva ),
he is known as Viçvanätha. And because he has attained the
foremost position among the community of bhaktas  (bhakta-
cakra ), he is known as Cakravarté. Hence his name has become
significant as Viçvanätha Cakravarté.
The great preceptor, mahä-mahopädhyäya  Çréla Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura, an eminent äcärya  and great scholar
of Vedänta  in the Çré Gauòéya sampradäya  and the crest-jewelÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !7
of rasika-bhaktas , has compiled an invaluable commentary on
Çrémad  Bhagavad-gétä  named Särärtha-Varñiëé , a shower of
essential meanings. This commentary was written in Sanskrit
and was previously only available in Bengali translations.
Consequently, the Hindi and English-speaking audience havebeen completely deprived of reading this invaluable treasure.
Thus, for the comprehensive welfare of faithful persons, I
am translating the commentary into Hindi and English. The
style and bhäva  of the commentary are extremely deep and
enriched with exalted philosophical conclusions ( siddhänta ).
To make the translation simple and comprehensive, I found it
necessary to write a Särärtha-Varñiëé Prakäçikä-våtti , a further
explanation to illuminate the commentary. This arduous task
is not possible without the mercy of Çré Guru, Vaiñëavas andÇréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura himself. Therefore, first
of all, in a mood of great distress, I pray at their lotus feet for
their mercy and blessings.
Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä  is the essence of all çrutis , Upaniñads
and Puräëas . Based on the sound evidence of Vedic litera-
ture received through guru-paramparä , it is concluded that
Vrajendra-nandana Çré Kåñëa Himself, the son of the Kingof Vraja, is Svayaà Bhagavän,  the Original Personality of
Godhead. He is the embodiment of all nectarean mellows
(akhila-rasämåta-mürti ) and He is the omnipotent ( sarva-
çaktimän ), non-dual Absolute Reality ( advaya-jïäna-para-
tattva ). Among His unlimited potencies three are prominent:
cit-çakti  (the internal potency), jéva-çakti  (the marginal po-
tency) and acit-çakti  (the external potency). By the will of
Svayaà Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, Vaikuëöha, Goloka andVåndävana are transformations of His cit-çakti . All jévas are
a transformation of His jéva-çakti  and the material creation
is the transformation of His mäyä-çakti . The jévas are of two
types: mukta  (liberated) and baddha  (bound). The mukta-
jévas are eternally engaged in relishing the bliss derived from1! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 8
serving Bhagavän in Vaikuëöha, Goloka and various other
dhämas . They never become bound in this material world,
the prison-house of mäyä , and hence they are called nitya-
mukta , eternally liberated. Sometimes, by the will of Bhagavän,
they appear in this illusory world as His associates for thesole purpose of bestowing welfare to the people. The othertype of jéva is called anädi-baddha , or bound by mäyä  since
time immemorial. As a result of being bound, the jéva is be-
ing burnt by the three types of miseries while wandering inthe cycle of birth and death.
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, who is an ocean of compassion, seems
to have created illusion ( ajïäna ), by the influence of His
acintya-çakti  (inconceivable potency) in the heart of His
nitya-siddha-parikara  Arjuna. Thus, on the pretext of dispel-
ling this illusion, He spoke Bhagavad-gétä , which establishes
ätma-tattva  for the deliverance of all jévas under the grip of
mäyä . The subject ultimately established in Bhagavad-gétä
is viçuddha-bhagavad-bhakti , supremely pure devotional ser-
vice to Bhagavän. The jévas under the influence of mäyä
become situated in their pure constitutional position(viçuddha-svarüpa ) only by taking shelter of çuddha-bhakti ,
as described in the Gétä , and can thus render service to Çré
Bhagavän. Aside from this, there is no beneficial path forthe baddha-jévas .
On the basis of concrete evidence from çästra and invin-
cible arguments, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura andother prominent Gauòéya Vaiñëava äcäryas have clearly es-
tablished that the speaker of Bhagavad-gétä  is not niùçaktika
(devoid of potency), nirviçeña  (devoid of variety), or niräkära
(formless), nor is He nirguëa  (devoid of transcendental quali-
ties such as apräkåta-dayä , transcendental mercy). The jéva
is never parabrahma , and even in the liberated stage can never
become parabrahma . Even after attaining mukti , the jéva will
remain a pure atomic spiritual particle. However, at that timeÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !9
he is said to be a bhagavat-parikära , an eternal associate of
Bhagavän.
In Vedic mantras  (çruti), it is proven that both Parameçvara,
the Supreme Controller, and the jévätmä  are qualified as
having knowledge ( jïäna-svarüpa ), as being the knower
(jïätä-svarüpa ), the enjoyer ( bhoktä-svarüpa ), the doer ( karttä-
svarüpa ) and possessed of a pure spiritual ego ( cinmaya-
ahaìkära ). Therefore, regarding their constitutions, there is
no difference between them from the perspective of tattva.
However, because the jéva is an atomic spirit, his knowledge is
limited and he can be overpowered by mäyä . Parameçvara is
the master of mäyä . Although there is no difference between
Éçvara and the jéva on the basis of tattva , the perception of a
difference is real. This perception of difference is calledvaiçiñöya , meaning speciality or having a uniquely distin-
guishing charact eristic. Just as the sun and the suns rays
are simultaneously one yet different, being the possessor of
attributes and the attribute respectively, similarly, the relation-
ship between Parameçvara and the jéva, which is that of being
one and different, is firmly proven in the Vedas . Since this
relationship of simultaneous oneness and difference is beyondintellect and is only intelligible with the help of çästra , it is
therefore called acintya , inconceivable. Thus the subject mat-
ter of Bhagavad-gétä  is the nitya acintya-bhedäbheda-rüpa para-
tattva , the eternal Supreme Reality, who is inconceivably one
with and different from His potencies.
Although it is accepted that para-tattva  Çré Kåñëa is simul-
taneously one with and different from the jéva and the
material world, which are both transformations of His çakti ,
it is the perception of difference which is eternal and pre-dominant, not the perception of oneness. Knowledge of thejévätmä , Paramätmä, the abode of Paramätmä and the means
to attain Paramätmä have been delineated in appropriateplaces in this Bhagavad-gétä .1! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 10
Although karma , jïäna  and bhakti  have been explained as
the three means to attain brahma , bhakti-yoga  is the only
means to achieve Bhagavän. The preliminary stage of bhakti-
yoga is called karma-yoga . When there is further progress, the
intermediate stage is called jïäna-yoga  and in its mature and
elevated stage it is called bhakti-yoga . Karma  in itself is not
a direct sädhana (practice) to attain Bhagavän, but only a
means to attain that direct sädhana . When the heart becomes
purified by following karma-yoga mixed with bhakti , which is
bhagavad-arpita-karma  (offering the fruits of ones activities
to Bhagavän) as described in the Vedas , tattva-jïäna  (the true
knowledge of spirit and non-spirit) appears there. Both jïäna
and karma  which are devoid of a sense of bhagavat-tattva  are
futile.
Along with the appearance of tattva-jïäna , kevala-bhakti
manifests in the heart. When this kevala-bhakti  attains its
mature stage, then prema  manifests in the heart of the jéva.
This prema  is the only means of attaining and having direct
realisation of Bhagavän. This is the concealed mystery of theBhagavad-gétä . One cannot achieve mukti  merely by
nirviçeña-jïäna  (knowledge of Bhagaväns impersonal feature).
Only when jïäna  is mixed with bhakti-bhäva , can one ob-
tain mukti  in the form of sälokya , särüpya  and so on, as an
extraneous result. One can attain prema-mayé sevä  to Svayaà
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa in His supreme abode, Goloka-Våndävana by performing kevala-bhakti  as described in the
Gétä . When one attains this abode, there is no possibility of
coming back to the material world. For the jévas, achieve-
ment of this prema-sevä  is the prayojana , the ultimate goal.
Bhakti  is of two types: kevalä  (exclusive) and pradhäné-
bhütä (principally inherent). Kevala-bhakti  is also called
ananyä , akiïcanä , viçuddhä  and nirguëä bhakti.  Pradhäné-
bhütä-bhakti  is also of two types: karma-pradhäné-bhütä ,
where bhakti  predominates over karma , and jïäna-pradhäné-ÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !11
bhütä , where bhakti  predominates over jïäna . By performance
of karma -pradhäné-bhütä  bhakti , which gradually purifies the
heart, tattva-jïäna  is achieved. The result of performing
jïäna-pradhäné-bhütä bhakti is mukti . Only that karma -
pradhäné-bhütä  bhakti  which aims at tattva-jïäna and that
jïäna -pradhäné-bhütä bhakti  which aims at obtaining kevala-
bhakti  are to be known as karma -yoga  and jïäna-yoga  re-
spectively. These are only steps to bhakti . Otherwise, without
bhakti  both jïäna  and karma  are futile.
This Gétopaniñad  is composed of eighteen chapters, begin-
ning from Chapter Twenty-five of the Mahäbhäratas  Bhéñma-
parva  to Chapter Forty-two. It has three divisions, each
consisting of six chapters. The first division explains that thejévätmä  is an aàça  (part) of Éçvara, and that his svarüpa
(constitution) is such that he can acquire the eligibility to
render service to Bhagavän, the aàçé (whole). Çuddha-bhakti-
tattva , the principle of pure devotional service, has been ex-
plained in the middle six chapters. It is this type of bhakti  that
is the topmost means of attaining bhagavat-prema , which is
the supreme object to be achieved. In the third and final part,tattva-jïäna  is defined. The subject matter of the Gétä is kevala-
bhakti , which is like cintämaëi , a wish-fulfilling jewel. This
cintämaëi  has been safely kept inside Bhagavad-gétä , which is
likened to a treasure chest. The base of this chest is niñkäma -
karma -yoga, the lid is jïäna-yoga  and the treasure is bhakti .
Only those who have staunch faith, who are fixed in dharmika
principles, who have good character and who are self-controlledare qualified to study this conversation.
For the proper flow of the book, Çré Kåñëa Dvaipäyana
Vedavyäsa has included in the first twenty-seven çlokas
phrases such as: dhåtaräñöra uväca  or saïjaya uväca.  They
should be accepted as the introductory part of Gétä . Just as a
piece of salt when mixed with the salty ocean completelydissolves to become one with the ocean, these introductory1! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 12
words composed by Çré Vedavyäsa have similarly become one
with the great ocean of Bhagavad-gétä  spoken by Çré Kåñëa.
Arjuna:  Arjuna is an eternal associate of Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa.
It is completely impossible for him to fall into a state of lam-
entation and delusion. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.7.7) it is said:
yasyäm vai çrüyamäëäyäà.  Bhakti  unto the lotus feet of
Puruñottama Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa,  who is transcendental to
the modes of material nature, at once appears in the hearts of
those who with great faith hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam , which
is filled with the topics of His sweet pastimes, and thus de-
stroys lamentation, illusion and fear. How then, is it possible
that bhakta-pravara  (the greatest devotee) Arjuna, who is a
nitya-parikära  of Çré Kåñëa serving in sakhya-rasa  (divine
friendship), can be in a state of illusion and lamentation?
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, having arranged Arjunas illusion for the
sake of the jévas afflicted with grief and delusion, says: teñäm
ahaà samuddhartä måtyu-saàsära-sägarät. I deliver them
from the ocean of material existence ( Gétä 12.7).
 Through the medium of questions and answers, He defines
the svarüpa  (true nature) of His own tattva , as well as that
of the jéva, dhäma , mäyä , bhakti  and so forth.
While commenting on the çloka : sarva-dharmän parityajya
(Gétä  18.66), Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura quotes
Kåñëa as saying: tväm avalambyaiva çästram idaà loka-mäträm
evo padeñöämi. Having made you the instrument, I am de-
livering this message of Bhagavad-gétä  for the benefit of every
jéva. Apart from this, in his commentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam
called Särärtha-darçiné-öékä , Çréla Cakravarté Öhäkura explains
the çloka , yogéndräya namaù (12.13.21), to mean  that the
description of Arjunas bewilderment in Bhagavad-gétä  is just
a statement of words. In fact, Arjuna is an eternal associate
of Bhagavän. There is not even a tinge of this illusory world in
him, what to speak of his being overwhelmed by lamentationÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !13
and delusion. But beneficial instructions are given through
the medium of famous personalities among perfected saints
who are very merciful and highly expert in performing ac-
tivities for the welfare of the jévas. This is seen throughout
the çästras and such is the position of Arjuna .
Añöädaça Vidyäs (Eighteen Types of Knowledge): There are
four Vedas   Åg, Yajur , Säma  and Atharva   and six Vedäìgas
(limbs of the Vedas )  çikñä , kalpa , vyäkaraëa , nirukta , jyotiña
and chanda . Then there are mémäàsä , nyäya , dharma-çästra ,
puräëa , äyur-veda , dhanur-veda , gändharva-veda  and artha-
çästra . These are the eighteen vidyäs , or types of knowledge,
as mentioned in Viñëu Puräëa :
aìgäni vedaç catväro mémäàsä nyäya-vistaraù
dharma-çästraà puräëaï ca vidyä hy etäà catur daçaù
äyurvedo dhanurvedo gändharväç ceti te trayaù
artha-çästraà caturthaà ca vidyä hy añöädaçaiva täù
Kurukñetra:  Çréla Vyäsadeva has referred to the battlefield
of Kurukñetra as dharma-kñetra . This has a hidden meaning.
According to Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (9.22.4), this land is named
Kurukñetra after King Kuru. The Çalya-parva  of the Mahäbhärata
relates the following story:
Once, when Kuru Mahäräja was ploughing this land,
Devaräja Indra appeared and asked him, For what purpose
are you doing this? Kuru Mahäräja answered, I am plough-
ing this land so that those people who give up their bodies here
may attain Svarga -loka (the heavenly planets). Hearing this,
Devaräja ridiculed him and returned to Svarga-loka. The king
again began ploughing with great enthusiasm. Although
Devaräja returned again and again to deride and deliberately
disturb the king, Kuru Mahäräja remained unperturbed and
continued his work. Finally, on the insistence of other devatäs ,
Indra became pleased with Kuru Mahäräja and gave him the1! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 14
benediction that whoever gives up his body or is killed in battle
on this land certainly attains Svarga. Hence, this land, knownas dharma-kñetra , was chosen for the battle.
Also in the Jävälopaniñad  (1.2), Kurukñetra is described as
a yajïa-sthalé (place of sacrifice) for the devatäs  and all living
entities. One attains Svarga-loka by the performance of yajïa
at this place.
Also in the Sat-Patha Brähmaëa , it is written: kurukñetraà
deva-yajanam-äsa tasmäd ahuù kurukñetraà deva-yajanam.The devas  performed worship of the Lord in Kurukñetra.
Therefore, sages have named this place deva-yajanam . The
phrase dharma-kñetra  is composed of two words: dharma  and
kñetra . The word kñetra  indicates land for cultivation. When
a farmer waters the rice field, a type of weed called çyämä
grass also grows along with the rice plants. This grass looksexactly like the rice plants, and grows by taking the waterused for the rice field, thereby covering the rice plants. Even-tually, the rice plants dry up. Therefore, an expert farmer

In the same way, in this land of Kurukñetra, Bhagavän ÇréKåñëa maintained and nourished Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja, thepersonification of dharma , along with his associates by
annihilating those who are anti-religious, pseudo-religiousand non-religious, like Duryodhana and others.
The land between the rivers Sarasvaté and Dåñadvaté is
known as Kurukñetra. At this place, both the great sage Mudgalaand Påthu Mahäräja performed austerities. Çré Paraçurämajéperformed yajïas  at five different places in this land after
annihilating the kñatriyas . Therefore, previously this kñetra  was
known as Samanta Païcaka. It later became famous asKurukñetra, following the activities of Mahäräja Kuru.
Saïjaya:  Saïjaya was the son of a charioteer named
Gavalgama. He was çästra-jïa  (a knower of the conclusionsÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !15
of çästra ), generous and dharmätmä  (dedicated to religious
principles). Because of these virtuous qualities, Grandsire
Bhéñma appointed him and Vidura as Dhåtaräñöras royal
ministers. Saïjaya was considered to be a second Vidura and
was also an intimate friend of Arjuna. Due to receiving divine
vision by the mercy of Çré Vyäsadeva, he was able to narrate
all the events of the war to Dhåtaräñöra. This enabled him
to view the battle of Kurukñetra from within the distant royal
palace in Hastinäpura. Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira also described
Saïjaya as a sweet-speaking well-wisher of everyone, who
had a peaceful temperament, and was always satisfied and
impartial. He was fixed in the bounds of morality ( maryädä )
and was never agitated by others ill behaviour. Always
remaining unbiased and fearless, his speech was fully
consistent with dharmika  principles.

After understanding the internal intention of Dhåtaräñöra,
Saïjaya confirmed that there would definitely be a war. Butknowing that the result would be contrary to Dhåtaräñörasexpectations, Saïjaya is speaking these words beginning withdåñtvä etc. Here, the word vyüòham  means the arrangement
of the Päëòava army into a strategic formation. Thus KingDuryodhana, who felt fear within himself, spoke nine çlokas
beginning with paçyaitäm  in the next çloka .

Unfortunately, apart from being blind since birth, at the
time of the Mahäbhärata war, Dhåtaräñöra was also bereftof both dharmika  and spiritual vision. Thus he became
overwhelmed with lamentation and illusion. Due to the
influence of the dharma-kñetra , his son Duryodhana might
return half of the kingdom to the Päëòavas. Fearing this, hebecame dejected. Saïjaya, being highly dharmika  and a
visionary  (dürdarçé ), could sense the internal feelings of
Dhåtaräñöra. Although Saïjaya knew that the result of thisbattle would not be in Dhåtaräñöras favour, he very intelli-gently hid this information and, while pacifying Dhåtaräñöra,said, Duryodhana is not going to compromise with thePäëòavas. Rather, after seeing the extremely strong arrange-ment of the Päëòava army, he is personally approachingDroëäcärya, his guru  in military science, to inform him of
the actual situation. Duryodhana had two motives for ap-
proaching the äcärya . First, he was fearful after seeing the
formidable arrangement of the Päëòava army. Second, on thepretext of giving his guru  due respect, he wanted to display
his political expertise. Due to his expertise in politics, he wascertainly qualified in all respects for the post of king. This isverified here by his diplomatic behaviour. This is the mean-ing of the çloka : saïjaya uväca etc .ÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !17
Duryodhana:  Among the one hundred sons of Dhåtaräñöra
and Gändhäré, Duryodhana was the eldest. At the time of his
birth, there were various bad omens which caused many saintly
persons such as Vidura to fear that he would be the cause of
the destruction of the Kuru dynasty. According to theMahäbhärata , Duryodhana took birth from an aàça  (a part)
of Kali. He was sinful, cruel and a disgrace to the Kuru dynasty.
At the time of his name-giving ceremony, the family priests
and other learned astrologers, seeing the indications of his
future, gave him the name Duryodhana. Finally, after a hint
from Çré Kåñëa, Bhéma killed him in such a horrific way that
even to think of it would make ones hair stand on end.
Vyüha:  It is said in Çabda-ratnävalé : samagrasya tu sainyasya
vinyäsaù sthäna-bhedataù / sa vyüha iti vikhyäto yuddheñupåthivé-bhujäm. A vyüha  is the formation of a military
phalanx, arranged by an expert king in such a way that it is
impenetrable by opponents from any direction, thereby
assuring victory in battle.
Droëäcärya:  Droëäcärya taught astra-çastra , the science
of weaponry, to the sons of both Päëòu and Dhåtaräñöra. He
was the son of Mahärñi Bharadväja. Because he was bornfrom a droëa , a wooden water-pot, he became famous by the
name Droëa. Just as he was a great teacher of astra-çastra ,
he was similarly expert in the knowledge of Veda  and Vedäìga
(auxiliary portions of the Vedas ). After pleasing the Maharñi
Paraçuräma, he learned from him the secrets of dhanur-veda
(the science of archery) and other sciences. Since he had the
benediction that he could die at the time of his own choosing,no one could kill him. After being insulted by his childhood
friend, King Drupada of Päïcäla, Droëäcärya went to
Hastinäpura to earn a livelihood. Impressed by Droëas quali-
fications, Grandsire Bhéñma appointed him the äcärya  to
instruct and train Duryodhana, Yudhiñöhira and the other2! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 18
princes. Arjuna was his dearmost disciple. In the battle of
Kurukñetra, King Duryodhana, by polite persuasion anddiplomacy, appointed him as commander-in-chief of the
Kaurava army, second-in-command to Bhéñma.

With these words Duryodhana is implying, Dhåñöadyumna,
the son of Drupada, is indeed your disciple. He has taken birthonly to kill you. Although you knew this, you continued togive him çikñä  (military training). This certainly exposes your
dull intelligence. Here, Duryodhana has used the word dhématä ,
intelligent, for Dhåñöadyumna. This has a deep meaning.Duryodhana wants Droëäcärya to realise that, althoughDhåñöadyumna is Droëäcäryas enemy, he learned fromDroëäcärya personally how to kill him. Thus he is veryintelligent. Just to arouse the anger of his teacher, Duryodhana
diplomatically remarks, Now see his great intelligence at the

Dhåñöadyumna:  Drupada, The King of Päïcäla, performed
a yajïa  with the desire to beget a son who would kill
Droëäcärya. From the fire of the yajïa  a boy appeared holding
armour and weapons. At the same time a voice from the skypredicted that this son of Drupada would kill Droëa. Thebrähmaëas  named this heroic looking boy Dhåñöadyumna. He
learned the dhanur-veda  from Droëäcärya, who was extremely
benevolent. Although he knew that one day Dhåñöadyumnawould kill him, still, with great effort he trained him in astra-

Yuyudhäna:  Yuyudhäna is another name for the heroic
Sätyaki. He was a very dear servant of Çré Kåñëa, extremely
valiant and an atirathé  among the commanders-in-chief of
the Yädava army. He learned the secrets of astra-çastra  from
Arjuna. In the Mahäbhärata conflict he fought on the side
of the Päëòavas.
Viräöa:  Viräöa was the pious king of the land of Matsya.
The Päëòavas spent one year incognito under his shelter. His
daughter Uttarä, later married Abhimanyu, the famous son
of Arjuna. Viräöa was killed in the Mahäbhärata war along
with his sons Uttara, Sveta and Çaìkha.
Drupada:  Drupada was the son of Påñata, the king of
Päïcäla. Since Mahäräja Påñata and Mahärñi Bharadväja,the father of Droëäcärya were friends, Drupada andDroëäcärya were also friends in their childhood. Later, whenDrupada became king, Droëäcärya approached him for
financial help, but Drupada insulted him. Droëäcärya did
not forget this disrespect. When Arjuna completed hiseducation in astra-çastra , Droëäcärya asked Arjuna to capture
Drupada and offer him at Droëas feet as guru-dakñiëä.
Arjuna followed his order. Droëäcärya took half ofDrupadas kingdom and then released him. To avenge thisinsult, Drupada performed a yajïa  in which Draupadé and
Dhåñöadyumna appeared from the fire.
Cekitäna:  Cekitäna was a Yädava in the dynasty of Våñëi.
He was a very chivalrous mahärathé  and was one of the com-
manders-in-chief of the Päëòava army. In the Mahäbhäratawar, he met his death at the hands of Duryodhana.
Käçiräja: Käçiräja was the king of Käçé. He was born from
a part of the asura  Dérghajihva. A valiant and courageous
hero, he fought on the side of the Päëòavas.4 - 6! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 22
Purujit and Kuntibhoja:  Purujit and Kuntibhoja were
brothers of Kunté, the mother of the Päëòavas, and were thusthe maternal uncles of the Päëòavas. In the Mahäbhärata
war they were killed by Droëäcärya.
Çaibya:  Çaibya was the father-in-law of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira.
His daughter Devikä was married to Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja.He is known as nara-puìgava , the best of men, and was
recognised as a powerful, heroic warrior.
Yudhämanyu and Uttamaujä:  The valiant, powerful
blood brothers Yudhämanyu and Uttamaujä were princes ofthe Päïcäla kingdom. At the end of the Mahäbhärata war,they were killed by Açvatthämä.
Saubhadra:  Bhagavän Çré Kåñëas sister, Subhadrä, was mar-
ried to Arjuna. The heroic Abhimanyu was born from the wombof Subhadrä, and therefore he is also known as Saubhadra.He received training in astra-çastra  from his father, Arjuna,
and from Çré Balaräma. He was an exceptionally chivalroushero and a mahärathé . At the time of the Mahäbhärata war
he was sixteen years old. In the absence of Arjuna, Abhimanyualone was able to penetrate the cakra-vyüha , a special
military formation which had been arranged by Droëäcärya.Trapped in the vyüha , he was unjustly killed by the combined
efforts of seven mahärathés , including Droëa, Kåpäcärya and
Karëa.
Draupadeya:  Draupadé gave birth to a son from each of the
five Päëòavas. Their names were Pratibindhya, Sutasoma,Çrutakarmä, Çatänéka and Çrutasena. Collectively, they wereknown as Draupadeya. Their fathers were Yudhiñöhira, Bhéma,Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva respectively. At the end of theMahäbhärata war Açvatthämä, desiring to please his friendDuryodhana, murdered these five princes at night as they slept.
In addition to the names of the warriors mentioned by
Duryodhana, there were many other mahärathés  in the armyÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !23

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Kapi-dhvaja:  Kapi-dhvaja is a name for Arjuna that denotes
the presence of the mighty Hanumän on the flag of hischariot. Arjuna was very proud of his skill in archery. Once,he was strolling on the bank of a river carrying his Gäëòévabow. There he saw an old monkey. Paying obeisances to him,Arjuna asked, Who are you?19 - 20! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 34
The monkey politely replied, I am Hanumän, servant of
Çré Räma.
Arjuna then asked, Are you the servant of the same Räma,
who, unable to make a bridge of arrows over the ocean, em-
ployed monkeys to build a bridge of stones? It was only then
that His army could cross the ocean. If I had been there at
that time, I would have built such a strong bridge of arrows
that the entire army could have easily crossed over.
Hanumän replied very politely, But your bridge would not
have endured the weight of even the weakest monkey in Çré
Rämas army.
Arjuna said, I am going to make a bridge of arrows over
this river and you may cross it with as heavy a load as you
can carry.
Hanumän then expanded himself into a huge form and
jumped towards the Himalayan mountains. He returned with
heavy stones tied to every hair on his body. As soon as he
placed one foot on the bridge, it started to quiver but,surprisingly enough, did not break. Arjuna trembled in fear.
Remembering his worshipable Deity, Çré Kåñëa, he prayed,
O Lord! The honour of the Päëòavas is in Your hands.
When Hanumän put the full weight of both his feet on
the bridge, he was astonished to find that it did not break. If
the bridge did not break, it would be a matter of great shame
for him. Within his heart, Hanumän remembered his
worshipable Lord, Çré Rämacandra. Meanwhile, his glance
fell upon the water below the bridge, where he saw streamsof blood flowing. Hanumän immediately jumped off and
peered below the bridge. Oh! What is this? My worshipable
Lord, Çré Rämacandra, is personally supporting the bridge of
sharp arrows on His back! He at once fell at the lotus feet
of Çré Rämacandra.
At the same time, Arjuna saw the Lord not as Çré Räma
but as Çré Kåñëa. Both Hanumän and Arjuna lowered theirÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !35
heads in shame before their worshipable Lord, who said,
There is no difference between these two forms of Mine. I,
Kåñëa, in the form of Çré Räma, come to establish the bounds
of morality and proper dharmika  conduct ( maryädä ) and, in
this very form of lélä-puruñottama  Kåñëa, I am akhila
rasämåta mürti , the personification of the nectar of all rasas .
From today onwards, you, who are both My servants, should
become friends. In a battle in the near future, the mighty
Hanumän, situated on the flag of Arjunas chariot, will give
him protection in all respects.
For this reason, Hanumän graced the flag of Arjunas
chariot in the battle of Mahäbhärata. Arjuna thus received
the name Kapi-dhvaja, or one who has a monkey on his flag.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Håñékeçaù means the controller of all senses. Although
Kåñëa is Håñékeça, when He received orders from Arjuna, Hebecame controlled by Arjunas sense of speech alone. Aho!
Bhagavän is controlled only by prema . Guòäkeça consists of
two words, guòä  and akeçä . Guòä  refers to guò, very sweet,
unrefined sugar. Just as guòä  exhibits all sweetness, similarly
akeçäù  exhibits the sweet taste of the rasa of their affection.
Akeçä  refers to the guëa-avatäras ; Viñëu, Brahmä and
Maheça.  A indicates Viñëu,  ka Brahmä, and  iça indicates
Mahädeva (Çiva). How can these parts, or guëa-avatäras ,
manifest their aiçvarya (superiority of opulence)  before a
person whose order was followed, out of prema , by Svayaà
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, the crest-jewel of all avatäras ? Instead,
they consider their lives to be successful by manifesting thesweet mellow of their affection towards Arjuna, who is there-fore known as Guòäkeça (one who receives sweet affection
from the three guëa-avatäras ). Indeed, Bhagavän Mahäviñëu,
Paravyoma-nätha (Lord of the transcendental sky), onceadmitted to Arjuna, I only brought the sons of the brähmaëa
here with a desire to see both you and Kåñëa. (Ç rémad-
Bhägavatam  10.89.58)24 - 25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 38
Guòäkä also means sleep, and one who has control over
sleep is called Guòäkeça. It is not surprising that the sameArjuna by whose prema  even Çré Kåñëa, the controller of
mäyä , becomes controlled, conquered just one ordinary
function of mäyä  called sleep. This is its hidden meaning.
Bhéñma-droëa-pramukhataù  means in front of Bhéñma and
Droëa, and sarveñäà mahékñitäm  means in front of all the
other kings also.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çreyo na paçyäméti  means I do not see anything auspicious.
The sannyäsés  who have attained perfection in yoga, and the
warriors who are killed in battle both attain the celestial sunplanet. From this statement it appears that a person who is
killed in battle attains auspiciousness, but one who kills re-
ceives no such sukåti  (pious result). One may question this
by saying that a person who kills and is victorious in battle will
certainly receive both fame and the pleasure of sovereignty
over a kingdom, therefore it is beneficial for Arjuna to fight.
In answer to this, Arjuna says: na käìkñe.  I do not desire this.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
According to çruti, there are six types of aggressors ( ätatäyé ):
those who set fire to the house, give poison, attack with
deadly weapons, steal ones wealth, usurp ones land or ab-
duct ones wife. Arjuna argues. If you say O Bhärata, im-mediately upon seeing these six types of aggressors one should
kill them without consideration because, according to the
injunctions of çästra , such killing is proper and no sin is in-
curred, then in reply I would say that by killing those as-
sembled here, we will certainly incur sin.
There is a reason behind Arjunas logic. According to artha-
çästra , the science of economics, to kill an aggressor is proper.
The injunctions of artha-çästra , however, are less importantÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !45
than those of dharma-çästra . As Yäjïavalkya Åñi has said,
Know dharma-çästra  to be superior to artha-çästra . Hence,
Arjuna said, According to dharma-çästra , by killing äcäryas
and others we will certainly incur sin. Not only that, we will
not even derive any mundane pleasure from it. For this rea-
son, Arjuna uses phrases such as sva-janam .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
According to småti-çästra , no sin is incurred by killing six
types of aggressors. But by the statement of çruti: mäà hiàsät
sarva bhütäni , the injunction not to kill any living entity is
established. Whenever there seems to be a contradiction
between çruti and småti , the statements of çruti are accepted
as superior. This is the instruction of the çästras . Similarly,
in comparison to artha-çästra , the path provided by dharma-
çästra  should be considered superior. Following this logic,
Arjuna feels that although the sons of Dhåtaräñöra are theaggressors, sin will be incurred by killing them.
Here, we also see another speciality in the character of
Arjuna. At the end of the battle of Mahäbhärata, Arjuna tiedAçvatthämä as one would tie up an animal and brought himto the feet of Draupadé for the offence of killing the sons ofthe Päëòavas. At that time Draupadé was crying. Being gen-erous and liberal, she said that Açvatthämä, the son of theirguru, should be forgiven. Bhéma, on the other hand, said that
he should be killed immediately. Arjuna, finding himself in adilemma, looked towards Kåñëa, who said, A brähmaëa  is not
deserving of the death sentence even if he has fallen from hisstatus. On the other hand, a person who comes to make a le-thal attack with weapons must certainly be killed. Under-
standing Çré Kåñëas inner intention, Arjuna cut the hair of
that unqualified brähmaëa  Açvatthämä, forcibly removed the
gem from his forehead and expelled him from the camp. Theinternal feeling of Arjuna is that whatever the situation may36! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  1 46
be, no one can be happy by engaging in sin. Such a person
cannot even receive worldly happiness, what to speak of tran-scendental pleasure. Adherence to the Vedas , småti , sadäcära
(the injunctions of saintly behaviour) and self-satisfaction are
the four symptoms of dharma . Fighting against ones kinsmen
is an activity which is contrary to both the Vedas  and sadäcära ,
and brings with it feelings of repentance.

O Janärdana, the intelligence of Duryodhana and

the sin incurred by betraying their friends. But whyÇLOKA SAINYA -DARÇANA  !47
should we, who have such knowledge, engage in such improper
acts as these?
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Arjuna asks,  Aho! Why are we still engaged in this battle?
To answer his own question he speaks this çloka  beginning
with the words yady apy.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Arjuna considers that in this battle there are teachers such
as Droëäcärya and Kåpäcärya, maternal uncles such as Çalya
and Çakuni, family elders such as Bhéñma, the sons ofDhåtaräñöra, and relatives and kinsmen such as Jayadratha.
Çästra  forbids turning against such persons: åtvik-
purohitäcärya-mätulätithi-samçriteù / bäla-våddhäturair
vaidya-jïäti-sambandhi-bändhavaiù. One should not quar-
rel with one who performs yajïa , a family priest, a teacher,
maternal uncle, a guest, those who are dependents, young
children, elderly persons and relatives.
But I have to fight with these very persons. Thus, Arjuna
expressed his unwillingness to fight with his own kinsmen,who now stood before him. But why are they all determined
to fight with us? Contemplating this, Arjuna concludes that
they have become overpowered by their petty, selfish inter-
ests and have thus lost their ability to discriminate between
what is beneficial and what is not beneficial, between
dharma  and adharma . As a result, they have forgotten what
sinful reactions are incurred by destroying ones own dynasty.We do not have any selfish motives, so why should we en-
gage in such an abominable and sinful act?

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Dhåtaräñöra was pleased to know that even before the battle
began, a religious  feeling ( dharma-pravåtti ) had suddenly
awakened within Arjunas heart. Arjuna was expressing aver-
sion to facing the battle by adhering to the principle of non-violence, considering it to be the supreme dharma (ahiàsä
paramo dharmaù ). Dhåtaräñöra deliberated as follows: It
would be fortuitous for us if this battle did not take place,because my sons could then be permanent sovereigns of thekingdom, without any obstacle. However, he still inquiredas to what happened next.
Saïjaya, who was endowed with fine intelligence, could
understand Dhåtaräñöras inner motive; thus he very expertlydetected the inference, and crushed the hopes of the blindking. He said, Even after seeing Arjuna in such a condition,Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa has not neglected him. Rather, He willinstil that same natural propensity into the heart of Arjunawith which He annihilated Madhu and other asuras .
Through Arjuna, He will arrange the death of all your sons.Therefore, do not harbour any hope of attaining the king-dom without a battle.
Saïjaya continued describing to Dhåtaräñöra the statements
of Çré Kåñëa. To fight is the sva-dharma  (prescribed duty)
of kñatriyas . Why, at this time of battle, are you becoming
averse to your sva-dharma ? To lose interest in this dharma-
yuddha (righteous battle) is unfavourable for any higher at-
tainment ( anärya-juñöa ) that will give you mokña , Svarga and
fame. Such loss of interest destroys reputation and happi-ness in this material world ( akérti-kara ).

Do not be a coward. He is saying, Such apparent coward-ice befits a low-class kñatriya.  But you are My friend. There-
fore in no way does it befit you. Arjuna may say, O Kåñëa,do not doubt my lack of courage. I am enthusiastic to fight.Rather, please understand that from a dharmika  point of view
my decision not to fight is a sign of discrimination, to showrespect to my gurus  such as Bhéñma and Droëa; and it is a
symptom of my compassion for the sons of Dhåtaräñöra, whoare weak and about to die from wounds caused by my weap-ons. Kåñëa replies, My answer to this is kñudram ; this is
not discrimination and compassion, but lamentation anddelusion. Both reveal the weakness of your mind. Therefore,O Parantapa, abandon this weakness of heart and stand upand fight. Para  refers to enemies and tapa to the act of chas-
tising them.ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !57
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çré Bhagavän said, For kñatriyas  who are brave and situ-
ated in their sva-dharma , to be cowardly in battle is not be-
fitting or glorious. Having been born of Påthä from the por-tion of Devaräja Indra, you are as brilliant and powerful ashe. Besides this, since I am mahä-maheçvara , the Supreme
Controller, and you are My friend, you are therefore veryinfluential; so it is not befitting for you to be cowardly. Ifyou claim that such behaviour is not cowardice but wisdomand compassion, then My reply is that this is not true. Thisis not wisdom and compassion; it is lamentation and delu-sion born from weakness of mind. Wisdom and compassiondo not give rise to confusion and delusion. From your previ-ous statement, na ca çaknomy avasthätuà bhramatéva ca me
manaù (Gétä  1.30), it is clear that your mind is reeling.
It is appropriate to mention here that, once being pleased
by the service of Kunté, the sage Durväsä gave her a boon inthe form of a mantra  by which she could summon any devatä
to appear before her and fulfil her desires. On the order ofMahäräja Päëòu, Kunté chanted that mantra  to call Dharma
(Yamaräja), Väyu and Indra. As a result, Yudhiñöhira, Bhéma
and Arjuna, respectively, were born. Through the twin AçvinéKumäras, Päëòus second wife, Mädré, gave birth to Nakulaand Sahadeva.

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In answering the question as to why he is not fighting,
Arjuna claims that, according to dharma-çästra , violating the
honour of a worshipable personality brings inauspiciousness.Therefore I shall not fight. To support his action he speaks
this çloka , beginning with katham . If Kåñëa says, Bhéñma and
Droëa are fighting against you, so how can you not fightback? then Arjuna may answer, Because I consider themto be püjä-arhau , worshipable, it is therefore right that I not
fight them. Is it proper for me to angrily pierce with sharparrows those persons at whose feet I should offer flowers withdevotion? No, it is not proper.
By addressing Çré Kåñëa as Madhusüdana, Arjuna is present-
ing this logic: O dear friend, You have also killed enemies inbattle, but You have not killed Your guru , Sändépani Muni,
nor Your relatives, the Yadus. O You who are known as
Madhusüdana (killer of Madhu), are Madhus  (enemies)

While enacting Their human-like pastimes in order to set an

They performed the pastime of learning the sixty-four arts

Öhäkura writes that if They had accepted a Vaiñëava guru ,
he would have immediately recognised Çré Kåñëa as SvayaàBhagavän, and the pastime of learning would not have taken
place. Therefore, these two brothers intentionally went to
the Çaivite Sändépani Muni, son of the renowned Yogamäyä-

It would be better to maintain my life in this world

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Arjuna is saying to Kåñëa, If You ask how I will maintain
my life if I do not desire to accept the kingdom, my answer is
that it is better for me to eat food acquired by begging, an act
condemned for kñatriyas , than to kill my gurus . Even though I
may be defamed in this world for such an act, inauspicious-
ness will not fall upon me. It is not proper to abandon my gurus
simply because they are following the proud and adharmika
Duryodhana, who is unable to discriminate between what is
just and what is not. If You say that it is recommended in
dharma-çästra (Mahäbhärata Udyoga Parva ) to reject the guru
if he is proud, unable to discriminate between good and bad
actions and engaged in abominable activities, then my reply
is, mahänubhävän , Where is the possibility of these defects
in such personalities as Bhéñma and Droëa, who have con-
quered lust, time and so forth? It may then be argued: although
a man is a servant of wealth, wealth is not the servant of any-
one. This is confirmed in Bhéñmas statement to Yudhiñöhira
Mahäräja: O Mahäräja, it is true that I am bound by the wealth
of the Kauravas. Thus, if You say that his repu tation as a
mahänubhävän  (great personality) has already been ruined by
the word artha-kämé  (one desirous of wealth), then I must reply,ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !61
Yes, this is true. Still, if I kill them, I will only feel distress.
For that reason I am using the word artha-kämän  (desirous of
wealth). How can I enjoy the objects of the senses if I kill all
of the Kauravas, who are very greedy for wealth, when suchsense objects will be tainted with their blood? In other words,despite their greed for wealth, they will always be my gurus . I
will become a traitor by killing them, and any pleasure derivedwill be adulterated with sinful deeds.

As though inattentive to Kåñëas words, due to being over-
powered by grief and delusion, Arjuna once more asserted, Iconsider it extremely inauspicious and sinful to kill my gu-
rus, Droëäcärya, Kåpäcärya and my most worshipable
Grandsire Bhéñma, who are standing before me in this battlearray, what to speak of my own family members and rela-tives, just for the sake of this petty material kingdom. Thechance of a place in the higher planets is completely lost forone who kills such gurus . Therefore, I consider it better to
maintain my life in this world by begging.
It is stated in the Kürma Puräëa :
upädhyäyaù pitä jyeñöha-bhrätä caiva mahé-patiù
mätulaù çvasuras trätä mätämaha-pitämahau
bandhur jyeñöhaù pitåvyaç ca puàçyete guravaù småtäù
He who instructs the Vedas , the father, elder brother, king, ma-
ternal uncle, father-in-law, protector, maternal grandparents,paternal grandparents, relatives and those who are elderly allare considered ones gurus.
Çré Droëäcärya and Kåpäcärya were born in high-class
brähmaëa  families. Besides knowledge of dhanur-veda (the
science of archery), they were also scholars of the Vedas  and
dharma-çästras  and were dharmika  by nature. Even on the
battlefield, Arjuna saw them as his gurus . Droëäcärya, who5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 62
had foreseen the possibility of war, made Arjuna take a vow
that, if for any reason they came face to face in battle, Arjunamust fight with him.
Grandsire Bhéñma, the son of King Çäntanu and Gaìgä
devé, remained a lifelong celibate. According to Çrémad-
Bhägavatam (9.22.19), he was a bhakta  of Çré Kåñëa, extremely
chivalrous, in control of his senses, generous, a knower of theAbsolute Truth and, by vow, bound to speak the truth. Evendeath was under his control. He is prominent among thetwelve mahäjanas :
svayambhür näradaù çambhuù / kumäraù kapilo manuù
prahlädo janako bhéñmo / balir vaiyäsakir vayam
Çrémad-Bhägavatam 6.3.20
Thus Bhéñma, the knower of the Absolute Truth and the
spiritual master of the whole world, was Arjunas teacher in
the same category as Droëäcärya. Even though he supported
the Kauravas in their fight against the Päëòavas, who were
devotees of Çré Kåñëa, he is Kåñëas very dear bhakta and he
acts only for His pleasure. Bhéñma is counted among the jïäné-
bhaktas . He said to Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja, What can I do? I
am completely bound by the wealth (salary) of the Kauravas.
Although it is not my desire, I have to fight on their side. But
I give you this boon: you will be victorious in the battle.
Here, Grandsire Bhéñma externally appears to be greedy for
wealth and dependent on others, but in fact he is the master
of his senses and supremely independent. Therefore, to glorify
him in the present çloka , Çuddha -Sarasvaté has combined the
two words hi and mahänubhävän  into himahänubhävän.
Hima  indicates ice or snow. That which destroys hima  is called
himahä , sun or fire, and anubhävän  means one who has the
capability. Therefore, a person who is extremely powerful like
the sun or fire is himahänubhävän . The powerful sun and fire
can burn all impure objects without becoming contaminatedÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !63
themselves. They always remain pure. Similarly, Bhéñma is
himahänubhävän , a greatly powerful person. It is said in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.33.29) that fire can burn all pure and
impure objects and is thus known as sarva-bhuk , that which
can consume everything without becoming impure itself.Similarly, even if a pure and powerful person appears to trans-gress the principles or etiquette of dharma , he remains com-
pletely free from all defects.
Someone may say that the powerful Bhéñma committed no
injustice by taking the side of the Kauravas and fighting thePäëòavas. One may question, however, how Kåñëas parama-
bhakta  could pierce the body of his worshipable Lord with sharp
arrows? Is this a symptom of his bhakti?  In answer it is said:
1) To allure the asuras , Çré Kåñëa made His great devotee
Mahädeva, Çaìkara preach mäyäväda  which is nothing but
covered Buddhism and is against the principles of the Vedas .
From an external perspective this does not seem to be bhakti ,
but from the transcendental perspective it is bhakti , because
Mahädeva simply carried out the order of Bhagavän to be-wilder the asuras .
2) Mahädeva, being a great devotee of Kåñëa, assisted Him
in relieving the earth of äsurika  forces by instigating and
supporting Bäëäsuras fight against the Lord. Alone,Bäëäsura would never have dared to fight with Kåñëa, andthereby would not have been eliminated. Just as Mahädeva,taking the side of his own devotee, Bäëäsura, personally
fought with Çré Kåñëa, similarly Grandsire Bhéñma is siding
with the Kauravas and fighting against his Lord. Where, then,is the question of his bhakti  being lost?
3) To relieve Mother Earth from the burden of äsurika  forces,
Çré Kåñëa wanted to annihilate them in the Mahäbhärataconflict and thus re-establish  dharma . If Grandsire Bhéñma
and gurus  like Droëäcärya and others had not assisted the
opposing äsurika  side, then the battle at Kurukñetra would5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 64
never have been possible. Therefore, by omniscient Çré Kåñëas
own will, yogamäyä  inspired Bhéñma to fight on the side of
the opposing party. Thus, Bhéñma performed this act for the
pleasure of Kåñëa.
4) In his commentary on a çloka  from Çrémad-Bhägavatam ,
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that in the Mahäbhärata war,
by the will of Çré Kåñëa, an äsurika  mood entered Grandsire
Bhéñmas heart. Imbued with that mood, he aimed sharp ar-
rows at Kåñëa, otherwise, it would have been impossible fora çuddha-bhakta  like Bhéñma to act in such a way.
5) The parama-bhakta  Grandsire Bhéñma teaches ordinary
sädhakas  that even if a person of his exalted status accepts
the food or association of materialistic persons, his mind will
become contaminated and his discrimination lost.
6) Çré Bhagavän understood that Jaya and Vijaya wanted
to satisfy Him by fulfilling His desire to fight. He therefore
inspired the four Kumäras to visit Him and, in order to in-
fuse inimical thoughts into the hearts of Jaya and Vijaya, Heintentionally had the four Kumaras curse them. This curse
was just a pretence, because there is no possibility of any anger
existing in Vaikuëöha, what to speak of a curse. In fact, for
the satisfaction and pleasure of Çré Bhagavän, Jaya and Vijaya
personally begged to have an inimical mood and by doing so
there was no diminution in their bhakti .
Had Grandsire Bhéñma shown any symptom of desiring to
kill Kåñëa instead of pleasing Him, he would have fallen from
his position as a bhakta  forever. Grandsire Bhéñma offered the
following prayer glorifying Çré Kåñëa on the battlefield at
Kurukñetra:
yudhi turaga-rajo-vidhümra-viñvak-
kaca-lulita-çramaväry-alaìkåtäsye
mama niçita-çarair vibhidyamäna-
tvaci vilasat-kavace stu kåñëa ätmä
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.9.34ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !65
While commenting on this çloka , Çréla Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura gives a very rasika description of
Grandsire Bhéñmas bhakti-bhäva  by saying that Bhéñma per-
ceives that, just as the dust raised from the hooves of the cows
in Vraja decorates the charming face of Çré Kåñëa and in-
creases His beauty and sweetness, in the same way the dust
raised from the hooves of the horses on the battlefield also
increases Çré Kåñëas beauty and sweetness. There is noth-
ing ugly in a beautiful object. Although dust in itself is notbeautiful, when it falls on the soft, lotus-like face of Çré Kåñëa
it enhances His beauty and charm. When Kåñëa ran towards
Bhéñma carrying the wheel of a chariot, His hair was dishev-
elled. Bhéñma was then reminded of how Kåñëas hair looks
when, upon returning from cow-grazing, He runs behind the
lowing cows as they quickly move toward their sheds. Çrama-
väri means that, due to the forceful exertion of Kåñëa run-
ning towards Bhéñma on the battlefield, drops of perspira-
tion fell from His lotus-like face and beautiful limbs. ToBhéñma they appeared to be like the perspiration drops caused
by Kåñëas exertion in kandarpa-yuddha , amorous war of
cupid. Kåñëas running at Bhéñma is also a manifestation of
His mood of bhakta-vätsalya.  Kåñëa broke His own vow not
to fight in order to keep Bhéñmas vow that he would make
Çré Kåñëa take up weapons against him. Grandsire Bhéñma
observes, The reddish marks appearing on the limbs of Çré
Kåñëa, which are bruised and cut by my sharp arrows, look
like the love-bites made by the teeth of a passionate loverabsorbed in kandarpa-rasa with her beloved. Although a
young beloved may behave haughtily with her lover, whom
she loves millions of times more than her own life, by mark-
ing him with her nails and teeth, she cannot be said to be
devoid of love. Similarly, Bhéñmas madness in véra-rasa  (the
chivalrous mellow) is not an indication that he is devoid of
kåñëa-prema .5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 66
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa is raso vai saù  (T aittiréya Upaniñad  2.7.2),
meaning that He embodies the nectar of all mellows ( akhila-
rasämåöa-mürti ). In order to fulfil the desire of Çré Kåñëa to
taste véra-rasa , Bhéñma, one of His prominent bhaktas , took
the side of the Kauravas and wounded the limbs of ÇréBhagavän. Bhéñma thus pleased Him by fulfilling His desire.
In Çré Mahäbhärata , it is seen that Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa took
a vow not to use any weapon in the battle. On the other hand,
Bhéñma, His bhakta , took a vow that if he could not make Kåñëa
use weapons, he would not be considered the son of MahäräjaÇäntanu.  Bhagavän, who is affectionate to His bhaktas
(bhakta-vatsala ), broke His own vow and protected the vow
of Bhéñma.
sva-nigamam apahäya mat-pratijïäm
åtam adhikartum avapluto rathasthaùdhåta-ratha-caraëo bhyayäc caladgur
harir iva hantum ibham gatottariyaù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.9.37
Grandsire Bhéñma says, I offer my praëämas  again and again unto
bhakta-vatsala  Çré Bhagavän who, in order to protect my vow,
broke His own promise. He jumped from the chariot, took a wheelin His hand and ran towards me with great speed.
In spite of taking the side of the opposing party, Grandsire
Bhéñma is a parama-bhakta . Of this there is no doubt. From
the character of Bhéñmadeva, we learn that whatever he doesis favourable; it is for the pleasure of Kåñëa and it assistsKåñëas lélä-viläsa . His profound character is beyond any
mundane reasoning. However, if a conditioned soul ( mäyä-
baddha-jéva ) imitates Bhéñma and engages in illicit activities
or commits aparädha while making a show of being a guru ,
he can never be considered a sad-guru . Bhagavän Åñabhadeva
has said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.5.18):ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !67
gurur na sa syät sva-jano na sa syät
pitä na sa syäj janané na sä syät
daivaà na tat syän na patiñ ca sa syän
na mocayed yaù samupeta-måtyum
A guru  who cannot deliver a disciple from the imminent cycle
of birth and death ( måtyu-saàsära ) by giving him instructions
on bhakti is not qualified to be a guru .
 Only a mahä-puruña who is çästra-jïa (thoroughly expert
in the imports of the çästra) , who is endowed with realisa-
tion of parabrahma  and who is detached from this material
world is qualified to be a guru . For this reason, Bali Mahäräja
rejected Çukräcärya, who was opposed to the principles ofbhakti . Thus, it is the injunction of the çästra to reject such
a guru.  There is no sin or fault in not surrendering to or not
following an unqualified guru , nor indeed in rejecting him.
Life-long celibate Bhéñma, after winning the svayaàvara
of the three daughters of the king of Käçé   Ambä, Ambikä
and Ambälikä   had Ambikä and Ambälikä married to his
brother Vicitravérya. The first girl, Ambä, insisted on mar-rying Bhéñma, but he had taken a vow of life-long celibacy,and thus rejected her request. Not finding any other solution,Ambä approached Paraçuräma, Bhéñmas astra-çastra-guru .
Paraçuräma called Bhéñma and ordered him to marry Ambä,but Bhéñma remained resolute. At this, Paraçuräma told himeither to marry her or fight with him. Bhéñma accepted thefight while speaking the following words:
 guror apy avaliptasya käryäkäryam ajänataù
utpatha-pratipannasya parityägo vidhéyate
Mahäbhärata Udyoga Parva  179.25
A guru who is engrossed in sense gratification, who is a fool with
no ability to discriminate between proper and improper behaviour,and who is following a different path, devoid of çuddha-bhakti , is
a false guru. One should immediately reject him.5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 68
Such a parama-bhakta  as Bhéñma cannot perform any ac-
tivity which is against the principles of bhakti . Paraçuräma
is an avatära  of Bhagavän. Considering that the vow of
Bhéñma to be righteous, Paraçuräma accepted defeat in thisfight, which would have continued indefinitely because theywere evenly matched.

To ridicule His friend Arjuna, who is in sakhya-bhäva ,
Kåñëa shows him that it is improper to be aggrieved in thisway, thus drowning him in an ocean of embarrassment. ÇréKåñëa remarks, O, you are devoid of discrimination. Arjunahas accepted the position of Kåñëas disciple  (çiñya ) however,
it is improper to immerse a disciple in an ocean of shame inthis way. Therefore, Kåñëa is pursing His lips and trying tohide His smile. Here, the import of the word Håñékeça is that,although Kåñëa was previously controlled by the loving state-ments of Arjuna, now, for Arjunas own welfare, Kåñëa is con-trolling his mind, out of love.
Senayor ubhayor madhye  indicates that Arjunas grief and

Çré Kåñëa says, O Arjuna, your grief which is born from

Agatäsün  means from whom the präëa  has not gone. The
learned or wise do not lament, even for the subtle bodies ofsuch persons, because the subtle body is indestructible beforethe stage of mukti . In both conditions, gatäsün (without life)
and agatäsün  (with life), both the svabhäva (nature) of the
gross and subtle bodies is unchangeable. Foolish people la-ment, however, for the gross body of their father or relativeswhen the präëa  leaves it. They do not lament for the subtle
body, because generally they do not have knowledge of it.
Bhéñma and others are also ätmä , with coverings of gross

is improper. Thus, earlier you were saying that dharma-çästra

That portion of sac-cid-änanda para-tattva  (the Supreme
Absolute Reality, composed of eternality, consciousness andbliss), which is endowed only with the taöastha-çakti , is called
the jévätmä or the  jéva. The jévas are atomic particles of con-
sciousness by constitutional nature. Their eternal and naturalcharacteristic is bhagavat-sevä . Jévas are of two types, mukta
and baddha . The mukta-jévas  are eternally engaged in the
service of Çré Bhagavän in His abode. They never fall down.The baddha-jévas  have forgotten the service of Çré Bhagavän
since time immemorial, and thus being covered by the twotypes of material bodies, gross and subtle, are suffering threetypes of miseries as punishment in this material world.
The gross body of the baddha-jéva  is made of the five ma-
terial elements  earth, water, fire, air and sky  and is tem-porary and perishable. After death, the jéva changes his grossÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !75
body. Where there is birth, death will always follow. Today,
tomorrow, or after some years, death is certain.
måtyur janmavatäà véra / dehena saha jäyate

Çrémad-Bhägavatam 10.1.38
In Gétä  (2.27), it is said: jätasya hi dhruvo måtyuù. For one
who has taken birth, death is a certainty.
The jévas immediate designation, which is made up of mind,
intelligence and false ego, and which covers his pure nature,is called sükñma-çaréra  (the subtle body). One is granted a
new gross body in each birth, and at the time of death it isdestroyed, but such is not the case with the subtle body. Dueto the jévas  forgetfulness of Çré Kåñëas svarüpa , the subtle
body has been covering his svarüpa  since time immemorial.
This subtle body cannot be dissolved even after remember-ing Bhagavän through such processes as jïäna , yoga , tapasyä ,
dhyäna or study of the Vedas . It can only be dissolved by
remembering Him through the medium of bhagavad-bhakti .
At that time the jéva becomes situated in his pure nature
(çuddha-svarüpa ).

When we study these çlokas , it is quite clear that although
the subtle body has no beginning, it is acquired by forgetful-ness of Bhagavän ( bhagavat-vismåti ) and destroyed by remem-
brance of Him ( bhagavat-småti ).
Therefore, those who are ätma-tattva-vit , who know the
nature of the ätmä  to be immutable, imperishable and eter-
nal, do not lament or become disturbed at the loss of the grossbody. They grieve neither for a gross body without an ätmä11! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 76

will be destroyed in the future. On the other hand, those whoconsider their gross body to be their self are ignorant. Suchpersons are not even aware of the subtle body, what to speakof the ätmä . They consider the gross body (containing the
ätmä ) to be their mother, father, brother, or relative. When
the ätmä leaves that body, they consider their mother, father,
brother or relative to be dead, and they lament for that body.

Kåñëa asks the question, O My friend, Arjuna, when one
grieves over the death of a dear person, what is the object ofhis love, the body or the ätmä ? In Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(10.14.50) it is said:
sarveñäm api bhütänäà / nåpa svätmaiva vallabhaù
O king, for all jévas, the ätmä  is certainly dearmost. Ac-
cording to this statement of Çré Çukädeva Gosvämé, it is theÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !77
ätmä  that is the only object of love. Although there is a dif-
ference between Éçvara and the jéva, both types of ätmä  are
eternal and free from death. Thus, it is not the ätmä  that is
the object of grief. For this reason only, Çré Kåñëa is speak-
ing this çloka beginning with na tv eväham. It is not true
that I, Paramätmä, did not exist in the past. Certainly I wasexisting. In the same way, you, the jéva, also existed in the
past, as did the jévas who are all these kings. The possibility
of the soul not existing prior to his existence in his presentbody is refuted by this statement. Similarly, it is also not truethat you, these kings and I, will not continue to exist in thefuture. We will all continue to exist. Thus, it has been proventhat the soul is indestructible. In this regard, the Kaöha
Upaniñad  (2.2.13) states: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm
/ eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän. He who is the supreme
eternal amongst all eternal entities, the supreme consciousbeing among all conscious beings, is fulfilling the desires ofall living beings.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The jévas  contact with the gross body is called birth, and
separation from it is called death. When the jévätmä  is situ-
ated in the gross body, people have loving dealings with eachother. But, such ignorant persons, who consider the gross bodyto be the ätmä , do not realise that the real self is not mate-
rial, and thus, when a jéva disappears from a body, they be-
come absorbed in grief.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  Parékñit Mahäräja asked Çréla
Çukadeva Gosvämé, O brähmaëa , Çré Kåñëa was not born
to the same parents as the other cowherd boys. How was it
possible for those parents to have such unparalleled prema
for Him, that they did not even have for their own children?In response to this Çréla Sukadeva Gosvämé says, O King,12! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 78
for all living entities, ones own self ( ätmä ) is the most dear.
Although entities who are separate from ones self, such as ason, wealth, house and other objects, are dear to the self, theyare not as dear as the self itself. It is secondary to the affec-tion one has towards ones own self. O King, the affectionan embodied soul has for that for which he feels possessive-ness, such as a son, wealth and house, is not the same as theaffection he feels for his own self. In other words, there is adifference between I and mine. The amount of préti (af-
fection) one has for objects which are possessed by him isnot the same as the préti that one has for ones own self.
Those who consider the body to be the self do not feel thatwhich is related to the body, such as a house, a wife, or ason, is as dear to them as their own body. And even thougha persons body is the object of his affection, it is not asdear to him as the self, because when the body becomes old,the desire for survival still remains strong. This is due tothe excessive attachment one has for the self. Because ÇréKåñëa is the very Self of the self, He is the most dear ob-ject ( priyatama ) for every ätmä . The world, which is related
to Kåñëa, is also dear but not dearmost. Kåñëa is the objectof the word I, because He is the ätmä of all ätmäs. And that
which is related to Kåñëa, such as the universe, is the objectof the word mine. That is why Kåñëa is so dear to the cow-herd boys.
The above statements are also verified by the dialogue
between Yäjïävalkya and Maitreyé in Båhad-äraëyaka
Upaniñad (2.4.5) where it is said:
sa hoväca na vä are patyuù kämäya priyo
bhavaty ätmans tu kämäya pätiù priyo bhavati na
vä are sarvasya kämäya sarvaà priyaà
bhavaty ätmanas tu kämäya sarvaà priyaà bhavatiÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !79
The great sage Yajïävalkya said to Maitreyé, No living entity
loves another for the others satisfaction. Only for ones ownsatisfaction does the husband love his wife, the wife love herhusband, the father love his son and the son love his father. Aperson is dear, not for someone elses satisfaction, but for thehappiness and satisfaction of ones own self ( ätmä ).

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The following point may be raised: Since the ätmä  is associ-
ated with the body, the body will also be an object of our love.Furthermore, those who are related to the body, such as sons,brothers, relatives, grandsons and so on, will also be the objectsof our love, so when they die, we will certainly feel grief. ÇréBhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with dehinaù , in answer
to this. The jéva in the body attains boyhood; at the end of
boyhood he attains youth, and at the end of youth he attains13! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 80
old age. Similarly, at the loss of the body he attains another
body. Just as one does not grieve at the end of boyhood andyouth, which are objects of love due to their relationship withthe ätmä , similarly, one should not grieve for the loss of the
body itself, which is also an object of love due to its relation-ship with the ätmä , when it is lost. If a person grieves when
he attains old age at the loss of youth, then he also feels happywhen he attains youth at the loss of boyhood. Therefore, youshould feel happy because when Bhéñma and Droëa lose theirold bodies they will attain new ones. Or you should considerthat, just as in one body various stages of growth are reached,the same jéva attains various types of bodies.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The word dehé means the ätmä or jéva, which is unchange-
able, whereas the body is subject to transformation. Evenwhen the body undergoes changes from boyhood to youth toold age and to death, the embodied ätmä  does not undergo
any change. It always remains the same. Therefore, it is notproper to lament for the loss of the body. Just as when oneleaves boyhood and attains youth, one feels happiness insteadof grief, similarly, after death one attains a new, able andbeautiful body. Therefore, why should one feel distress?Rather, one should only feel happiness.
King Yayäti became old in his youth because he was cursed
by his father-in-law, Çukräcärya. In great distress, he humblybegged forgiveness at the feet of Çukräcärya. To please hisdaughter who was married to the king, Çukräcärya gave himthe boon that he could exchange his old age for the youth ofany of his young sons. His eldest son, Yadu, refused because hewanted to perform bhagavad-bhajana , but his youngest son, Puru,
gave his youth and accepted the old age of his father. In thisway, Yayäti again became young and enjoyed with his queens(Devayäné and others). In the company of his sons and grand-ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !81
sons, he considered himself very happy. Finally, however, he
understood that all these pleasures were temporary and the cause
of unlimited misery. Thus, he returned his sons youth to him
and went to the forest to perform bhajana  of Bhagavän ( Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  9.18.1-51). Therefore, it is appropriate to feel happy,
knowing that, at the loss of an old, weak and withered body,one will achieve a healthy, strong and beautiful new body.

Arjuna may tell Kåñëa, What You have said is true. Yet, the
troublesome mind of an indiscriminate person like myself,which is covered by grief and lamentation, is a source of mis-ery. It is not only the mind which causes trouble. Through theimpressions of the mind, the senses experience their respec-tive sense objects. Thus the senses, such as the sense of touch,14! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 82
also become the cause of trouble. For this reason, Kåñëa says
mäträ , indicating the sense objects that are accepted by the
senses. The experience of such sense objects is called sparçäù .
Çré Bhagavän explains çétoñëaù  ägamäpäyinaù. Although cool
water gives pleasure in the summer, that same water is the causeof distress in winter. Therefore, knowing them to be tempo-rary and flickering, one should tolerate the experience of thesesense objects. To tolerate them is an obligation prescribed inthe çästra . Taking bath is troublesome in the month of Mägha
(the winter month of January). In spite of this, one is not sup-posed to give up the obligatory routine of bathing as enjoinedin the çästra . Similarly, those same persons (ones brother, son,
etc.) who give happiness both when they are born and whenthey earn wealth, give pain at the time of their death. Know-ing this happiness and distress to be temporary and flickering,you should tolerate it. You cannot give up your sva-dharma of
fighting in the battle on the plea of affection for such rela-
tives. It is definitely a cause of great disturbance to give up
ones sva-dharma  that has been recommended in çästra .

These words are spoken for persons who have not yet at-

asaìgo hi ayaà puruñaù , the jévätmä does not factually have
a relationship with either the subtle or gross body, nor withthe characteristics of the body such as lamentation and de-lusion, which are imagined only due to ignorance ( avidyä ).
For this reason, the present çloka  beginning with the word
näsataù  is spoken. The word asataù  means that due to their
non-spiritual nature, lamentation and delusion which appear
to be in both the jéva (who is spiritual by nature) and his
shelter, the gross body, have no real existence. Similarly, theword sataù  means that, the jévätmä , whose nature is sat (eter-

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Nä bhävo vidyate sataù.  That which is sat (eternal truth),
cannot be destroyed. Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka
beginning with avinäçi  to clarify this statement. The funda-
mental nature ( svarüpa ) of the jéva is such that it pervades
the whole body. One may question, that if the consciousness
of the jéva only pervades the individual body and is there-
fore limited in size, will it not be temporary? In response, ÇréKåñëa says, No, it is not so. There is evidence of this in the
çruti and in småti also: sükñmänäm apy ahaà jévaù (Çrémad-
Bhägavatam 11.16.11). Among that which is subtle I am the
jéva. Also in the  Muëòaka Upaniñad  (3.1.9) it is stated: eño
ëur ätmä cetasä veditavyo yasmin präëaà païcadhä saàviveça .
The ätmä is very minute. It can only be realised in a pure heart
which is free from the three modes. The life air, divided intopräëa , apäna , vyäna , samäna and udäna , remains situated in
the body. In the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (5.9) it is said:
bälägra-çata-bhägasya / çatadhä kalpitasya ca
bhägo jévaù sa vijïeyaù / sa cänantyäya kalpate
One should know that the jévätmä is the size of one ten-thou-
sandth the tip of a hair.
Also in the Aitareya Upaniñad  (5.8): ärägra-mätro hy avaro
api drñöaù. The  jéva has an extremely subtle form.
The above statements of çruti  prove that the jévätmä is
atomic in size; it is very subtle. Just as the entire body can be
nourished by the application to the head or chest, of a po-
tent herb or a precious gem set in lac, similarly the jévätmä is
able to pervade the entire body although it is situated in one
place. There is no difficulty in reconciling this. Being boundby material designations, the jéva enters various species and
wanders in different heavens and hells. Dattätreya has also
verified this in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.9.20): yena saàsarate
pumän. The jévätmä wanders in the material world.17! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 86
In the present çloka , it has been described that the jévätmä
pervades the whole body. The jévätmä is called avyayasya , or
eternal. This is also verified in the çrutis :
nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm
eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän
Kaöha Upaniñad  2.2.13
He who is the supreme eternal ( nitya ) amongst all eternal enti-
ties ( nitya-jévas ), the supreme conscious being among all con-
scious beings, fulfils the desires of all living entities.
If we view this çloka  from a different angle, we can say that
all three: the body, the jévätmä and Paramätmä, are seen in all
human beings, birds, animals and so forth. The natures of thebody and the jévätmä  have been explained in the previous çloka :
näsato vidyate bhävo (Gétä 2.16), so what is the nature of the
third entity, Paramätmä? To answer this, Çré Bhagavän speaks
this çloka  beginning with the word avinäçé . The word tu is
used to indicate a different context. This material world hascome into existence only because mäyä  and the jévätmä are
by nature fundamentally different from Paramätmä.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
There are two indestructible truths. One is the atomic con-
scious jéva, aëu-caitanya-jévätmä , and the other is the mani-
festing source and controller of all jévätmäs , Paramätmä. The
same Paramätmä  is present as a witness in that which is both
inert and conscious. The jévas are unlimited. An individual
ätmä exists in each gross body. The jéva in each body indi-
vidually experiences happiness and misery. The SupremeAbsolute Truth, Paramätmä, is situated only as a witness andis untouched by the jévas happiness and distress. In this çloka ,
the nature of the indestructible jéva has been described. How
is it that the atomic jévätmä , being situated in one part of
the body, is experienced throughout the entire body? Çré KåñëaÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !87
answers this question in the present çloka . His statement
above is verified by Vedänta-sütra  (2.3.22):
avirodhaç candanavat
Just as a single drop of hari-candana  applied to one place makes
the whole body cool, similarly, the jévätmä , situated in one part
of the body, is experienced throughout the entire body.
 This is also verified in the småti -çästra :
aëumätro py ayaà jéväù svadehe vyäpya tiñöhati
yathä vyäpya çaréräëi hari-candana-vipruñaù
Just as a drop of hari-candana  applied to one part of the body
gives pleasure to the whole body, similarly, the jévätmä , being
situated in one part of the body, pervades the whole body.
If the question is asked, In which part of the body does
the jévätmä reside? the answer is, Within the heart. Hådi hy
eña ätmeti  (Ñaö-Praçné-çruti ). This is also stated in the
Vedänta-sütra : gunäd välokavat (Brahma-sütra  2.3.24). Like
light, the jévätmä , by its quality, pervades the whole body.
Although the jévätmä is atomic, by its quality of conscious-
ness it pervades the entire body. Just as the sun, situated in
one part of the sky, illuminates the whole universe, similarly,
the jévätmä also pervades the whole body. This has been stated
by Çré Bhagavän Himself in Gétä  (13.33).

To clarify the meaning of näsato vidyate bhävaù , Çré Bhagavän
speaks this çloka  beginning with antavantaù . The word çarériëaù
has been used to describe the embodied jéva. Aprameyasya
means that the jévätmä is very difficult to understand because
he is extremely subtle. T asmäd yudhyasva  means therefore
fight. Based on these arguments, Kåñëa concludes that it iscompletely improper to give up ones sva-dharma  which is
prescribed in çästra .

Kåñëa says, O friend, Arjuna, you are an ätmä and there-

beginning with ya enam . One who thinks that the jévätmä
kills (e.g. Arjuna kills Bhéñma), or the jévätmä is killed (Arjuna
is killed by Bhéñma), is ignorant. Therefore, O sakhä , why do
you fear achieving infamy just because ignorant people will

Çré Kåñëa is instructing Arjuna, You are an ätmä , and
therefore you are neither the subject nor the object of the

nor is he the object of the killing done by them. On the other
hand, ignorant people who identify the self with the body con-
sider only the gross body to be the subject and object of killing.
Kåñëa concludes, Therefore, becoming fully aware of this truth,
give up your identification with the gross body and become situ-
ated in the nature of the self. Surrendering unto Me, fearlessly
engage in your sva-dharma for My pleasure. You should not be
in ignorance about this. The same concept is also stated in çruti:
hantä cen manyate hataà / hataç cen manyate hatam
ubhau tau na vijänéto / näyaà hanti na hanyäte
Kaöha Upaniñad  1.2.19
If one who identifies the self with the body thinks that he will
kill someone, and one whose body is being killed thinks that he
is killed, both are ignorant because the ätmä neither kills any-
one nor is killed.

eternal and ever-existing. Though primeval, he remains
ever-youthful. When the body is destroyed, the jévätmä
is not destroyed.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
To establish the eternality of the jévätmä , Çré Bhagavän is
speaking this çloka  beginning with the words na jäyate
mriyate , in which it is proven that there is never any time
when the jévätmä  is born or dies. That there was no birth or
death for the jévätmä in the past and nor will there be in the
future is proven by the words näyaà bhütvä bhavitä . Çré
Bhagavän is further explaining, by the use of the word ajaù,
that the jévätmä does not take birth in either the past, present
or future. Thus He establishes that the jéva also existed in
the past. The word çäçvataù means that which is ever-exist-
ing, which is not destroyed in the past, present, or future.Therefore the jévätmä is eternal. If one still raises a doubt
that because the soul exists for a long time, he may be over-ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !91
powered by old age, Çré Bhagavän says in response, No, that
is not true because he is puräëaù . Although he is primeval,
he is ever-fresh and free from the six types of transforma-
tions, including birth and death. If someone then raises the
question, Will the soul not die, even figuratively, at the deathof the body? Çré Kåñëa answers, No, the soul has no rela-tionship at all with the body.

The eternal nature of the jévätmä has been established in
this çloka . He is beyond birth and death, and is eternal and
ever-existing. He is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.
Consequently, the jévätmä  is devoid of the six types of trans-
formations: birth, duration of existence, growth, procreation,
diminution and death. In the Kaöha Upaniñad  (1.2.18)  a similar
conclusion is given:
na jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcin / näyaà kutaçcin na vibhüva kaçcit
ajo nityaù çäçvato yaà puräëo / na hanyate hanyamäne çarére
The meaning of this çloka  is the same as Gétä 2.20, but in
this çloka there is one special word, vipaçcit , which means
one who knows the self. Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.25)
also verifies this conclusion: sa vä eña mahän aja ätmä jaro
maro måto bhayaù. The ätmä  is indisputably great, unborn,
deathless, free from old age, immortal and fearless.

nityam is an adverb. The use of the words avinäçi  (indestruc-
tible), aja (unborn) and avyayam  (immutable) denies that the
ätmä  can be diminished at all by acts of destruction. Çré

how can a person like you kill someone or cause someone to

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The ätmä has been described as indivisible, etc. Repetition
of this indicates the eternality of the jévätmä and removes
the doubts of those who are uncertain of its nature. If one
says three or four times that there is dharma  in Kali-yuga,
the repetitive use of the words will stress the fact that, with-out a doubt, there is dharma  in Kali-yuga. Similarly, the
jévätmäs  qualities have been repeated to confirm the eternality
of his nature. Here, the word sarva-gataù  (all-pervasive) indi-
cates that due to his own actions the jéva transmigrates
through all species of life such as devas , human beings,
animals and birds. The words sthäëuù  (fixed) and acalaù
(immovable) have been repeated in order to give a clearconception of the stable nature of the jévätmä . The jévätmä
is called avyaktaù  (imperceptible) because he is very subtle.
He is called acintya  (inconceivable, beyond reasoning) be-
cause he pervades the whole body as consciousness. He is
called avikäryaù  (immutable) because he is free from the six
types of transformations, such as birth and duration of ex-
istence.

ätmä  by the çloka : na jäyate mriyate vä kadäcin  (Gétä  2.20),
and in respect to the body by the çloka : jätasya hi dhruvo
måtyur  (Gétä  2.27), Çré Bhagavän now dispels the cause of
lamentation for both the jévätmä  and the body by speaking
this çloka , beginning with the word avyaktaù . Before birth,
devas , human beings, animals, birds and so on remain
unmanifest. Even at that time, the subtle and gross bodiesalso exist in their causal state in the form of matter, such asearth, but they are in an unmanifest stage. They becomemanifest in the middle period and after death they againbecome unmanifest. In the period of dissolution and devas-tation ( mahä-pralaya ), the jévätmä  also remains in his subtle
form because of the existence of his karma  and mäträ  (ten-
dency to accept sense objects). Therefore, all jévas remain
unmanifest in the beginning and again become unmanifestat the end. They only become manifest in the middle period.The çruti  also states: sthira-cara-jätayaù syur ajayottha-
nimitta-yujaù. All the moving and non-moving jévas become
manifest due to karma.  Therefore, why should one cry out
of grief? ( Çrémad Bhägavatam 10.87.29).
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.13.44) Çré Närada Muni says:
yan manyase dhruvaà lokam / adhruvaà vä na cobhayam
sarvathä na hi çocyäs te / snehäd anyatra mohajät
Whether you consider the human to be an eternal jévätmä or a
temporary body, or even if you accept an indescribable opinionthat he is both eternal and temporary, you do not have to la-ment in any way. There is no cause for lamentation other thanthe affection which has arisen out of delusion.ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !99

All living entities are born from the unmanifest stage, re-
main manifest for some time and again become situated in
an unmanifest state. Just to explain this point, the present
çloka  has been spoken. In his explanation of Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (10.87.29) cited in the above commentary, Çréla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura writes that, because alljévätmäs are manifest from Parameçvara, they are under His
control. Parameçvara is beyond material nature, remainingdetached from it. When He performs His pastime of glanc-ing over the material nature, the moving and non-movingjévas become manifest with their past impressions of karma.
Wherever the word utpanna  (created) is used it means to
become manifest. If one asks how the jévas, being merged in
Parameçvara, can take birth, the answer is given that it is byHis glance and the inspiration of His will ( icchä-çakti ). Past
karma  then becomes active, after which the jévätmä appears
along with his subtle body. Then, becoming united with thegross body, the jévätmä  takes birth. In other words, when the
designations born from the effect of material nature are dis-solved, the jévas are considered to have died; and when the
jévätmä appears with his past karma , impressions, and gross
and subtle bodies in various species of life in this materialworld, he is said to have taken his birth. This is stated inBåhad-äraëyaka-çruti :
yathägneù kñudrä visphuliëgä
vyuccaranty evam eväsmäd ätmanaù
sarve präëäù sarve lokäù sarve
deväù sarväëi bhütäni vyuccaranti
Just as sparks appear from a fire, so the senses (such as the power
to speak), the results of karma  (such as happiness and distress),
all the devas and all the living entities  from Brahmä down to
the ant appear from Me, Paramätmä.29! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 100
Mahäbhägavata Çré Yamaräja  also says: yaträgatas tatra
gataà manuñyam. The living entity  goes back to the same
unknown place from whence he came.

Çré Kåñëa is saying, O Arjuna, if you ask what this amaz-
ing subject is that I am speaking about, then listen. It is in-deed a matter of wonder that even after receiving this knowl-edge, your wisdom has not been awakened. In this regard itis true; this subject is a matter of wonder. Only for this rea-son is this çloka , beginning with the word äçcarya-vat , being
spoken. This whole material world, in the form of the com-bination of the body and the ätmä , is indeed a wonder.ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !101
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Since the truth about the science of the ätmä  is very diffi-
cult to understand, the ätmä , the person who instructs about
the ätmä , the instruction itself and the audience are all
amazing. In other words, only some very rare, great personslook upon the ätmä as amazing, and some very rare persons
hear about the ätmä  and accept him as amazing. That most
of the audience, even after hearing these instructions fromone who is tattva-vit  (a knower of the Absolute Reality),
cannot realise the ätmä is most amazing. This is also ex-
plained in Kaöha Upaniñad (1.2.7):
çravaëayäpi bahubhir yo na labhyaù
çåëvanto pi bahavo yaà na vidyuù
äçcaryosya vaktä kuçalo sya labdhä
äçcaryo sya jïätä kuçalänuçiñöaù
The opportunity to hear instructions about the science of the
self ( ätma-tattva ) is very rare. Even after hearing them, most
cannot realise the instructions because a master who is self-re-alised ( ätma-tattva-vit ) is very rare. If, by great fortune, such a
teacher is available, the students themselves who are willing tohear this topic are also extremely rare.
For this reason, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has instructed
the jévätmäs in Kali-yuga to perform çré hari-näma-saìkértana .
If even faithless persons chant the name of Çré Hari whiletalking, walking, sitting, standing, eating, drinking, crying,laughing, or in any other way, they will still benefit from it.Gradually, they attain the association of çuddha-bhaktas.  By
such association they can even attain bhagavad-prema , and
they easily attain knowledge of ätma-tattva as a secondary
result.

karma  (selfless activities) with buddhi-yoga  related to bhakti ,
he becomes free from the bondage of karma , that is, his bond-

All moving and non-moving objects in this world are to
be enjoyed only by Parameçvara, the sole enjoyer of this world.
Jévas are servants of  Bhagavän. They should engage in ser-
vice to Him using this universe as an instrument, and should
maintain their lives accepting His remnants. The supreme
duty of the jévas is to render loving service to Çré Bhagavän
(bhagavat-sevä ) with His property, without desiring to accept
that property as the object of their own enjoyment. In this
way, the jévas do not become bound by their karma (actions).

Endeavours on the path of bhakti-yoga  are neither
fruitless nor subject to loss. Even a little progress frees
one from great fear in the form of this material world.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Yoga  (buddhi-yoga ) is of two types: (1) bhakti-yoga  in the
form of hearing and chanting; and (2) bhagavad-arpita-
niñkäma-karma-yoga  which entails surrendering the fruits of
ones selfless actions to Çré Bhagavän. In Gétä  (2.47), Çré
Kåñëa says, O Arjuna, you have the qualification only to
perform action ( karma ). Now, before karma-yoga , bhakti-
yoga is being delineated. Gétä  (2.45) states, O Arjuna, situ-
ate yourself beyond the three modes of material nature. This
statement certainly refers to bhakti as being beyond the three
modes because only by bhakti can a person transcend theÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !113
modes of nature. This is well known from the Eleventh Canto
of Çrémad-Bhägavatam . Jïäna and karma  are described as
sättvika  and räjasika  respectively, which proves that they are
not beyond the three modes of nature.
Bhagavad-arpita-niñkäma-karma-yoga  is bhakti  which is
characterised by offering the fruits of ones karma  to Çré
Bhagavän. It does not allow the karma  to go in vain, as is the
case with the performance of karma  that is not offered to
Bhagavän. However, due to the lack of bhaktis  predominance
in such activities, they are not accepted as actual bhakti . If
karma , in which the fruits are offered to Çré Bhagavän, were
also described as bhakti , then what would constitute karma ?
If one says that karma  is only action, that is not offered to Çré
Bhagavän, it is not correct. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.12) states
that one of the characteristics of brahma  (the effulgence of
Çré Bhagavän) is that it is niñkarma  (inactive) and, being iden-
tical with the mood of inactivity, is called naiñkarmya. When
even brahma-jïäna , knowledge of brahma which is niñkäma
(without any material motive) and nirdoña  (faultless), is not
praiseworthy, being devoid of bhakti , then how can sakäma
and niñkäma-karma , if not offered to Bhagavän, be praisewor-
thy, since they are troublesome in the stages of both sädhana
(practice) and sädhya (the goal)?
According to the above-mentioned statement spoken by Çré
Närada ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.5.12), karma  which is not of-
fered to Çré Bhagavän is useless. Therefore, only that bhakti
characterised by hearing and chanting has been accepted asthe sädhana  to attain the sweetness of the lotus feet of Çré
Bhagavän. Nevertheless, niñkäma-karma-yoga  which is of-
fered to Çré Bhagavän is also worthy of consideration. Bothtypes of yoga (bhakti-yoga and niñkäma-karma-yoga ) are to
be understood by the word buddhi-yoga . This is evident from
the statements of Bhagavad-gétä  such as, I bestow upon them
that buddhi-yoga  by which they can attain Me, ( Gétä 10.10)40! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 114
and, O Dhanaïjaya, compared to buddhi-yoga , sakäma-
karma  (action with fruitive desire) is very insignificant ( Gétä
2.49).
Now, in this çloka  beginning with neha , the glory of nirguëa-
bhakti  (bhakti  free from the modes), which is characterised by
çravaëam  and kértanam , is being explained. Çré Bhagavän says,
The benefit that comes from even the initial steps of bhakti-
yoga can never be destroyed, and thus it does not have the
adverse effect of becoming lost. Conversely, if one starts toperform karma-yoga  but does not complete it, the result of
whatever karma  has been performed is lost, and the fault of
irregularity is incurred.
The question may be raised, Can the result of bhakti  be
attained by those who have the desire to follow the process,but are unable to perform it properly? Çré Kåñëa responds tothis by saying svalpam , which means that even if the practice
of bhakti  has only just begun, the result is never lost and it
will deliver one from the danger of this material world. Thelife histories of Ajämila and others are evidence of this. Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (6.16.44) also states that just by once hearing Çré
Bhagaväns name, even a caëòäla  is freed from the great fear
caused by material existence. Moreover in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.29.20) it is stated:
na hy aìgopakrame dhvaàso / mad-dharmasyoddhaväëv api
mayä vyavasitaù samyaì / nirguëatväd anäçiñaù
O Uddhava, because I have deliberately determined the tran-
scendental nature of this process, even if niñkäma-dharma  or pure
bhakti  in the form of hearing and chanting is improperly per-
formed, there is no possibility of the slightest loss.
The purport of these statements of Bhagavad-gétä  and
Bhägavatam  seems to be the same, but the above statement
of Bhägavatam  has a special characteristic: since a transcen-
dental object or activity is nirguëa , it is never lost. This is theÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !115
only point which is worthy of deliberation in this context. One
may argue that niñkäma-karma-yoga , if offered to Çré
Bhagavän, can also become nirguëa  by His grace. But it is
not a fact. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.15.23) gives evidence of
this:  Nitya  and naimittika  (obligatory and occasional) ac-
tivities which are performed without any fruitive desire and
offered to Me are considered sättvika . In other words, they
are not transcendental to the three modes.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Here, buddhi-yoga  is described as being of two types. The
first is bhakti-yoga , in the form of hearing and chanting, and
the second is niñkäma-karma-yoga  wherein the results of
karma  are offered to Çré Bhagavän. Of these two, the first is
mukhya  (primary)  and the second is gauëa (secondary and
related to the guëas ) bhakti-yoga.  In fact, bhakti-yoga  is com-
pletely nirguëa , transcendental to the modes. No irregulari-
ties, faults or unwanted reactions can occur at the beginning
or in the course of ones practice of bhakti-yoga , even if for
some reason, one is unable to complete it. Rather, a little per-
formance of bhakti-yoga delivers the performer from the ter-
rible dangers of the mat erial world and makes his life success-
ful by giving him the service of Çré Bhagavän.
The following example can be cited. Because Bharata
Mahäräja became attached to a deer, he was not able to com-
plete the full process of bhakti  in that life. In his next birth,
although he took the body of a deer, the influence of his pre-
vious lifes performance of bhakti  enabled him to associate
with çuddha-bhaktas of Bhagavän. Taking birth again, he
became an uttama-bhägavata  and performed service to Çré
Bhagavän. Therefore, Bhagavän says in Gétä  (6.40): pärtha
naiveha nämutra vinäças tasya vidyate. A person who has
fallen from the path of bhakti is never lost in this world or
in the next, nor does he obtain a miserable condition.40! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 116
On the other hand, in bhagavat-arpita  niñkäma-karma-
yoga, even if niñkäma-karma-yoga  is offered to Bhagavän, it
is still referred to as karma-yoga , not bhakti-yoga . By first
performing karma-yoga , the heart becomes purified and even-
tually one attains bhakti-yoga . Therefore, this karma-yoga
only aims indirectly at bhakti  from far away. Unlike pure
bhakti , however, karma-yoga  is not nirguëa (free from the
guëas ). Rather, it is called karma  in sattva-guëa . Moreover,
if this karma  is not performed perfectly or, if it is left incom-
plete, it may become lost and some unwanted reactions will
be incurred. However, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.25.23): mad-arpaëaà niñphalaà vä / sättvikaà nija-karma
tat. If a sädhaka  even begins to perform this bhakti-yoga
slightly, but due to his own incapability leaves the path, or his
practices cease due to his sudden, untimely death, either in
the beginning or intermediate stage, his endeavours in bhakti
will never go in vain. In other words, neither do his endeavours
become faulty nor does he incur any sin even if he is unableto complete the process. In his next life, the sädhaka  will
continue from that same point where his performance of
bhakti-yoga  was obstructed. The presiding Deity of bhakti-
yoga , Çré Kåñëa, or Bhakti-devé herself, make all these ar-
rangements. In this context, there is one important point tonote. Although a sädhaka  has faith, if there are some irregu-
larities in his performance due to ignorance of the process,the results of bhakti-yoga  will never be lost nor does he incur
sin. However, if someone offends guru , Vaiñëavas or tadéya-
vastu  (that which belongs or is related to Çré Bhagavän such
as Tulasé, Yamunä or the dhäma ), his bhakti-yoga  can be
completely ruined.

O Kuru-nandana, the intelligence of those who are
on this path of bhakti is resolute and one-pointed,
but the intelligence of those who are averse to bhakti
is many-branched and inconclusive.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
When compared to all other types of intelligence, that in-
telligence whose aim and object is bhakti-yoga  is supreme.
Bhagavän explains this by speaking the above çloka  begin-
ning with the word vyavasäya : Resolute intelligence in bhakti-
yoga is one-pointed. He describes the characteristic mood
of one who possesses such intelligence as follows: The in-
structions that my Gurudeva has given me about çravaëam ,
kértanam , smaraëam , päda-sevanam , etc. of Çré Bhagavän are
my very sädhana , my very sädhya  and my very life. I am un-
able to relinquish them in either the sädhana  stage or in
sädhya . My single desire and only engagement is to follow
them. Besides this, I have no other desire or engagement, evenin my dreams. There is no loss for me, whether by followingthese instructions I attain happiness or misery, or whethermy material life is destroyed or not. This type of resoluteintelligence is possible only in pure bhakti  which is free from
hypocrisy and cheating. It is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.28):41! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 118
tato bhajeta mäà bhaktyä / çraddhälur dåòha-niçcayaù
Knowing that all perfection is achieved through My bhakti alone,
a man of resolute faith will perform My bhajana  with devotion.
Only by bhakti  can intelligence become one-pointed. Çré
Bhagavän further explains this by also referring to bahu-
çäkhäù , that which has many branches. Because there are
unlimited types of desires in karma-yoga , intelligence applied
to it is also of unlimited types. Similarly, because there areunlimited varieties of sädhana  in karma-yoga , it has unlim-
ited branches. In the initial stage of jïäna-yoga  one fixes ones
intelligence in niñkäma-karma  to purify the heart. When the
heart is purified, the sädhaka  fixes his intelligence in karma-
sannyäsa , the renunciation of fruitive karma . Having attained
this stage, one fixes ones intelligence in jïäna . When one
realises that even jïäna  is unsuccessful and unable to grant
service to the lotus feet of Çré Bhagavän, one fixes ones in-telligence in bhakti . In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.19.1) it is said:
jïänaà ca mayi sannyaset. Jïäna must also be renounced
to attain Me.
According to the above statement of Çré Bhagavän, after
attaining the stage of jïäna , one has to fix ones intelligence
in jïäna-sannyäsa  (the renunciation of jïäna ). Thus, intel-
ligence is of unlimited varieties. Since karma , jïäna and
bhakti  all ought to be performed, their branches are also
unlimited.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Of the three types of buddhi-yoga : karma , jïäna and bhakti ,
only that buddhi  (intelligence) which is related to pure
bhakti-yoga is supreme. The exclusive aim and object of
mukhya-bhakti-yoga is Vrajendra-nandana Çré Kåñëa, and
that intelligence which is related only to Him is called
aikäntiké  or ananyä  (one-pointed or exclusive). The sädhakasÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !119
of such aikäntika-bhakti are free from the desires for mun-
dane enjoyment, mokña and from duplicity, therefore their
intelligence is resolute. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura
comments on Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.20.28). They resolutely
think, Even if there are millions of obstacles in the perfor-
mance of my bhajana , even if I lose my life, or if I have to go
to hell because of offenses or if lust overpowers me, I can never
give up bhakti , whatever the circumstance may be. I will not
perform jïäna and karma , even if Brahmä himself orders me
to. Under no circumstances can I give up bhakti . Only this
type of determination can be called niçcayätmikä buddhi .
Due to lack of such exclusive niñöhä  in Bhagavän, a persons
intelligence remains engaged in karma-yoga  and jïana-yoga.
His intelligence is called many-branched because of a vari-
ety of aims and objectives, such as the pleasures in this world
or the next related to profit ( läbha ), adoration ( püjä) and
distinction ( pratiñöhä ). His intelligence is filled with unlim-
ited desires.
According to the Vaiñëava äcäryas , Bhagavän Himself is
the non-dual, conscious Supreme Absolute Reality. He is called
nirguëa , being simultaneously beyond the material qualities
of sattva , rajas  and tamas , and endowed with all transcen-
dental qualities such as aiçvarya  (opulence), mädhurya  (sweet-
ness), dayä  (compassion) and bhakta-vätsalya (affection for
His bhaktas ). However, modern people who are uneducated,
bereft of tattva-jïäna , whose intelligence is covered by illu-
sion and who consider brahma  to be without transformations
(nirvikära ), without variety ( nirviçeña ) and untainted
(niraïjana ), accept Him as nirguëa in only a mundane sense .
They consider the lélä-avatäras  of Bhagavän to be brahma
but covered by mäyä , and that His svarüpa  and qualities, such
as compassion, are therefore material like their own. Theysay that by worshipping saguëa-brahma  (brahma  full of42! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 120
material qualities) their hearts will gradually become puri-
fied and they will become one with nirguëa-brahma (brahma
devoid of material qualities). The establishment of such con-clusions is as useless as trying to hit the sky because çästras
such as the Bhagavad-gétä , which describe the transcenden-
tal form and characteristics of Çré Bhagavän, refute this des-picable concept in all cases. Therefore, pure devotion fornirguëa-brahma  (Kåñëa), who is endowed with all transcen-
dental qualities, is called nirguëa-bhakti . In Çréla Çrédhara
Svämés commentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.29.11), he
explains nirguëa-bhakti  to be of one kind only, aikäntika  (one-
pointed). Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé has stated in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (3.29.7-10) that because sakäma-bhakti  is per-
formed with various material desires, it has unlimitedbranches such as tämasika sakäma-bhakti .

The irresolute sakäma-karmés  (persons with material desires)
are extremely dull-witted. To explain this, Çré Bhagavän speaksthis çloka beginning with yäm imäm . The phrase puñpitäà
väcaù  implies that these statements of the Vedas are only tem-
porarily pleasing, just like flowery creepers that are ultimatelypoisonous. Pravadanti  refers to those who in all respects ac-
cept such Vedic  statements as the summum bonum. Those
whose hearts have been captivated by such statements haveno resolute intelligence. This çloka  is in natural sequence with
Gétä 2.44: bhogaiçvarya-prasaktänäm.  It is impossible for such
people to have resolute intelligence, so it is not for them thatthis instruction is given. What to speak of not having resoluteintelligence, Çré Bhagavän even says that they are fools,avipaçcitaù . This is because they accept as the ultimate objec-
tive of the Vedas  the declaration of flowery statements such
as, By performing the cäturmäsya-vrata  one will attain im-
perishable results, or, After drinking soma-rasa  one becomes
immortal. They also speculate that beyond this there is no

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Becoming detached from the means to attain catur-varga
(dharma , artha , käma  and mokña ), only take shelter of bhakti-
yoga. Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka beginning with the
word  traiguëya , because the predominant subject matters of
the Vedas  illuminate karma , jïäna , etc., which are under the
guëas . The meaning of the word traiguëya is formed with the
suffix  syaï. Since, in the Vedas , there are excessive descrip-
tions of karma  and jïäna , according to the logic of bhümnä
vyapadeçä bhavanti  (wherein the title is based on the predomi-
nating composition), the Vedas  are called traiguëya (pertain-
ing to the three modes of nature). Only bhakti , however, can
take one to Çré Bhagavän. This is the verdict of the Mäöharaù-
çruti. The Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  states: yasya deve parä bhaktir
yathä deve tathä gurau. The meaning of the Vedas  can only
be revealed to one who has the same transcendental bhakti  to
both Çré Bhagavän and his gurudeva .
Nirguëa-bhakti is the only subject matter of the småtis , such
as the Païcarätra  and the Upaniñads , including the
Gétopaniñad  and Gopäla-tapani Upaniñad . If it is accepted
that bhakti is not described in the Vedas , bhakti will become
unauthoritative. Therefore, Kåñëa directs Arjuna to becomefree from the Vedic injunctions of jïäna and karma , which
are under the influence of the guëas . He tells him not toÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !125
perform them, but to always follow the process for achiev-
ing bhakti as stated in the Vedas . It is mentioned in Brahma-
yämala Puräëa , The pretentious display of exclusive hari-
bhakti , neglecting the process of païcarätra  recommended in
çruti , småti and the Puräëas , etc., results only in eventual
disturbance. This mistake or fault is inexcusable.
Those subject matters of the Vedas , that pertain to the guëas
(saguëa ) and those that are beyond the guëas (guëätéta ) are
called respectively traiguëya  (with the three  guëas ) and
nistraiguëya  (free from the three  guëas ). Çré Kåñëa says, Of
the two, pursue only nistraiguëya . Become free from the three
guëas  by the influence of My nirguëa-bhakti . Only then will
you become free from dualities such as honour and dishonour.
Therefore, remain exclusively in the association of My bhaktas
who are always situated in nitya-sattva .
Here, the explanation of how to become situated in viçuddha
(nitya ) sattva-guëa  will contradict the explanation on  becom-
ing free from the guëas . To achieve that which is lacking is
called yoga, and to protect that which one possesses is called
kñema . By the word niryoga-kñema , Çré Bhagavän is telling
Arjuna to become free from the concern for both yoga and
kñema . Upon becoming overpowered by the taste for My
bhakti-rasa , yoga and kñema  will not be a cause for concern.
When Çré Bhagavän states in Gétä (9.22), I personally carry
yoga and kñema , He is displaying His affection for His bhaktas
by stating, Because I carry their burden of maintenance there
is no need for them to separately endeavour for it. Ätmavän
means become a person endowed with intelligence grantedby Me.
Now the words nistraiguëya  and traiguëya  are being dis-
cussed. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.23-29) it is said:
mad-arpaëaà niñphalaà vä / sättvikaà nija-karma tat
räjasaà phala-saìkalpaà / hiàsä-präyädi-tämasam

Know that niñkäma-karma  offered to Çré Bhagavän is in sattva-
guëa . That action which is performed with a desire for the fruit

in tamo-guëa .
In the above çloka  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.25.23) niñphalaà
vä implies naimittika-karma  (work which is occasional), per-
formed without fruitive desires.

Jïäna  related to the self ( kaivalyam ) which is beyond the concep-

conception of I and mine, considering oneself to be the doerand the enjoyer) is räjasika . Jïäna  of inert matter, the mundane
world or the body is tämasika , while jïäna  related to Me is nirguëa .

Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.25.28
Food which is wholesome, pure and easily available is in sattva-
guëa . Food which is pungent, sour and gives pleasure to the senses
is in rajo-guëa . Food which is impure and the cause of misery is in
tamo-guëa  and that food which is offered to Me is nirguëa .
According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word ca in the above
mentioned çloka  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam 11.25.28) means that
that which is offered to Çré Bhagavän is nirguëa .

Happiness which comes from the self is in sattva-guëa , that
which comes from sense objects is in rajo-guëa , that which comes
from delusion and depravity is in tamo-guëa  and that happiness
which comes in relation to Me is nirguëa .
After explaining objects which exemplify the three guëas
in the above-mentioned Çrémad-Bhägavatam  çlokas (11.25.23-
29), Çré Bhagavän further explains how to attain perfection
in realizing the nature ( nistraiguëya-bhäva ) of an object
which is beyond the three guëas (nirguëa-vastu ). He says that
only by performing nirguëä-bhakti  can one conquer the in-
fluence of the guëas  that exist within oneself. This is stated
in the following çlokas :
dravyaà deçaù phalaà kälo / jïänaà karma ca kärakaù

Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.25.30
Everything material such as the substance, place, results, time,
knowledge, action, the agent, faith, situation, form and deter-mination are all traiguëya .

Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.25.31
O best of human beings, whatever states of being that are heard,
seen or conceived, which exist between the puruña  (the enjoy-
ing self) and prakåti  (material nature), are comprised of the three
modes of nature.
etäù saàsåtayaù puàso / guëa-karma-nibandhanäù

bhakti-yogena man-niñöho / mad-bhäväya prapadyate
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.25.32
O gentle one, all material conditions of the living entity ( puruña )
are born from action performed in the three guëas . Only those
jévas who, by practising bhakti-yoga , have conquered these modes
manifested in the citta become endowed with niñöhä  and are able
to attain Me.
Therefore, only by nirguëä-bhakti  can one conquer the
three guëas  and not by any other means. In response to the
question asked in Gétä  (14.21): kathaà caitäàs trén guëän
ativartate , How can one conquer the guëas  of material na-
ture? Then it is said later in Gétä  (14.26):
mäà ca yo vyabhicäreëa / bhakti-yogena sevate
sa guëän samatétyaitän / brahma-bhüyäya kalpate
Only those who render service to Me with aikäntika bhakti-yoga
can transcend the three gunas  and become qualified to realise
brahma .ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !129
In his commentary on this çloka  (Gétä 14.26) Çréla Çrédhara
Svämé says,  Ca is an emphatic. That is, those who exclusively
perform aikäntika-bhakti  (unflinching devotional service) to
Me, Parameçvara, can conquer all the guëas .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Dharma , artha , käma  and mokña  are called catur-varga  (the
four goals of human life). Bhakti is the fifth goal ( païcama-
puruñärtha ). Although in çästras such as the Vedas  the paths
of karma , jïäna  and bhakti have been instructed as the
sädhana  for the jévas, one can only attain Çré Bhagavän by
giving up all other paths and engaging exclusively in viçuddhä-
bhakti . This is also made clear by studying these two çlokas
from Çrémad-Bhägavatam :
bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù / çraddhayätmä priyaù satäm
bhaktiù punäti man-niñöhä / çva-päkän api sambhavät
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.14.21
I can only be attained through bhakti  performed with full faith.
I am naturally dear to My bhaktas  who take Me as the exclusive
goal of their  bhajana . Even the dog-eaters can purify themselves
of their lower birth by performing bhajana  to Me.
na sädhayati mäà yogo / na säìkhyaà dharma uddhava
na svädhyäyas tapas tyägo / yathä bhaktir mamorjitä
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.14.20
O Uddhava! Yoga , säìkhya , study of the Vedas , tapasyä  and däna
(charity) cannot overpower Me as does intense bhakti performed
solely to attain Me.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, In çästra  there are two
types of subjects: uddiñöa  and nirddiñöa . The subject which is
the highest objective of any çästra  is called uddiñöa-viñaya . That
instruction which indicates uddiñöa-viñaya  is called nirddiñöa-
viñaya . For example, because it is so dim, it is very difficult to46! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 130
see the Arundhati star in the sky without assistance. If
someones objective is to see it, he must first take an indica-tion from the biggest star closest to it. So, if Arundhati is the
uddiñöa-viñaya , the biggest star closest to it is the nirddiñöa-
viñaya . All the Vedas  indicate nirguëa-tattva  to be the uddiñöa-
viñaya . Because nirguëa-tattva  cannot be understood immedi-
ately, the Vedas  first describe saguëa-tattva  (reality with the
guëas ) which is the nirddiñöa-viñaya . Thus, mäyä , consisting
of the three modes,  sattva , rajas and tamas , initially appears
to be the subject matter of the Vedas . O Arjuna, do not re-
main entangled in this nirddiñöa-viñaya . Rather, attain
nirguëa-tattva , or that which is indicated to be the uddiñöa-
tattva , and become free from the guëas . Some parts of the
Vedic literatures describe karma  in rajo-guëa  and tamo-guëa.
Other parts describe jïäna in sattva-guëa , and in specific places
there is a description of nirguëa-bhakti . You should attain
nitya-sattva  (pure spiritual existence) by becoming free from
dualities such as honour and dishonour. In other words, byassociating with My bhaktas , renounce the endeavour for yoga
(acquisition) and kñema (preservation) sought after by the
processes of jïäna and karma  and, by the process of buddhi-
yoga, become free from the modes of nature.

All the purposes served by a variety of wells can
easily be fulfilled by a large lake. Similarly, whateverresults are attained by the worship of various 
devas
as described in the Vedas  can easily be attained
through the worship of Bhagavän by a brähmana  en-
dowed with bhakti .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Kåñëa continues, O, what more can I say about the
glories of that bhakti-yoga  which is nirguëa  and niñkäma .
Even initial endeavours in bhakti  are neither lost nor adverse
in their effect. Also in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.29.20) Çré
Kåñëa has told Uddhava:
na hy aìgopakrame dhvaàso / mad-dharmasyoddhaväëv api
mayä vyavasitaù samyaì / nirguëatväd anäçiñaù
O Uddhava, I have established the transcendental nature of this
dharma . If one engages in this selfless dharma  for My sake, there
is not the least possibility that it may lead to loss by fault ordegradation.
However, in this context vyavasäyätmikä buddhi  (resolute
intelligence) also indicates sakäma-bhakti-yoga . Çré Bhagavän
uses an example to prove this when He speaks the çloka be-
ginning with the word yävän . Since udapäne  is a singular noun,
it has been used here in a similar case. Here, the word udapäne
indicates a group of wells. Many purposes are fulfilled by dif-ferent wells. One well is used for the purpose of cleaning afterevacuation, one for brushing teeth, one for washing cloth, one
for cleaning hair, one for bathing and one for drinking water.
These different purposes which are fulfilled by various wells
can all be fulfilled at one and the same time by a large reser-
voir of water. It is laborious to go to different wells for various
purposes, but there is no labour in going to one reservoir. More-
over, a small well often has salty water, but water from a large46! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 132
lake is sweet. One should deliberate on this difference between
a well and a lake. Similarly, the different fruits one attainsthrough worshipping various devas , by the procedures described
in the Vedas  can all be attained simply by the worship of Çré
Bhagavän. The word brähmaëasya  means those who know
brahma  (Veda ). Only a brähmaëa  knows the Vedas  but, be-
yond such knowledge, the real brähmaëas  are those who spe-
cifically know bhakti  as the ultimate meaning of the Vedas .
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.3.2) it is also said:
brahma-varcasa-kämas tu / yajeta brahmaëaù patim
indram indriya-kämas tu / prajä-kämaù prajäpatén
A person desiring the brahma  effulgence should worship Brahmä,
the master of the Vedas . One desiring satisfaction of the senses
should worship Indra. A person desiring progeny should wor-
ship the Prajäpatis, while a person desiring wealth should wor-
ship Durgä.
After this it is said:
akämaù sarva-kämo vä / mokña-käma udära-dhéù
tévreëa bhakti-yogena / yajeta puruñaà param
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  2.3.10
Whether one is free from desires, full of desires or desirous of
mokña , one should, having attained a higher intelligence, wor-
ship parama-puruña  (Bhagavän) with intense bhakti-yoga .
Just as the rays of the sun are very intense when the sky is
free from clouds, similarly bhakti-yoga , which is devoid of
jïäna and karma , is also very intense. Ones intelligence
becomes many-branched by worshipping a number of devas
to fulfil various desires. Çré Bhagavän, however, can fulfil allof ones desires. When even a particle of such intelligence isengaged in worship, it is considered to be one-pointed becauseof the superlative nature of the object of worship.ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !133

The various activities that can be performed by the use of
separate wells can all be performed by using a large reservoirof water, such as a lake. Similarly, the various desires whichcan be fulfilled by worshipping different devas  as directed in
the Vedas  can all be fulfilled simply by worshipping Bhagavän.
If the heart is filled with many material desires, various devas
are worshipped to fulfil those desires. The resulting intelli-gence, which is many-branched, is called avyavasäyätmikä
buddhi . In contrast to this, the aikäntika  (one-pointed) wor-
ship of Çré Bhagavän is only achieved by focused, resoluteintelligence. For this reason, knowers of the Vedas  explain
bhakti  to be the sole essence of the Vedas . Therefore, bhakti-
yoga alone is vyavasäyätmikä buddhi .

Çré Bhagavän, the instructor of jïäna-yoga , bhakti-yoga  and
karma-yoga , has so far aimed His instructions about jïäna-
yoga and bhakti-yoga  towards His dear friend Arjuna. Now,
having considered Arjunas anädhikära  (ineligibility) to per-
form these two processes, He explains niñkäma-karma-yoga
in two çlokas , the first beginning with karmaëi .
By the words mä phaleñu , Kåñëa intends to say that those
who desire the fruits of their actions have extremely impurehearts. Your heart, however, is almost pure. I know this, andthat is why I am speaking in this way. If one points out thatany action one performs will bear fruit, Çré Bhagavän responds:mä karma-phala-hetur bhüù. A person becomes the cause
of the fruit only when he acts with a desire for it. You shouldnot act like that. I bless you not to fall into this category.Akarma means neglecting prescribed duties and vikarma
means performing sinful activities. You should not become
attached to either of these. Rather, you should despise them.I again bless you that you will be able to do this.
In Gétä  (3.2), Arjuna says: vyämiçreëeva väkyena buddhià
mohayaséva me. My intelligence is bewildered by Your ap-
parently ambiguous instructions. From this it should beunderstood that the previous statements of this chapter arenot entirely consistent with later statements. But here, ÇréKåñëas inner feelings ( mano-bhäva ) towards Arjuna are
worth considering. Just as I have become your subordinateby acting as your chariot driver, similarly you should also
become a follower of My order.

jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga . In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.3.43)
it is stated: karmäkarma vikarmeti veda-vädo na laukikaù.
An understanding of karma , akarma , and vikarma  can only
come from the Vedic literature, not from the words of mun-
dane persons.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, There
are three types of karma  to consider: karma , akarma  and
vikarma . Of these, two  namely vikarma  (engaging in sinful
activities) and akarma  (not performing ones sva-dharma ) 
are extremely inauspicious. You should not desire these. Give
up vikarma  and akarma , and carefully follow the path of
karma . Karma  is of three types: nitya-karma (daily duties),
naimittika-karma (occasional duties) and kämya-karma
(fruitive activities). Of these three, kämya-karma  is inauspi-
cious. Those who perform kämya-karma  become the cause of
the fruit of their activities. So it is for your benefit that I am
telling you not to adopt kämya-karma , because if you do, you
will become the cause of the results of your actions. You have
the right to perform your prescribed duties, but you do not have
the right to the fruits of any action. It is acceptable for those
who take shelter of bhakti-yoga  to perform nitya-karma and
naimittika-karma  solely in order to maintain their lives.

Kåpaëäù  refers to those who are unable to understand the
meaning of niñkäma-karma-yoga.  Such people are attached
to the fruits of their activities,  and consequently, they are
sometimes happy and sometimes distressed. This topic hasbeen explained at length in Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad .
Once, there was a great assembly of realised sages, mahärñis
and brahmarñis  in the royal court of Janaka Mahäräja. Janaka
Mahäräja, assisted by his royal servants, brought hundreds
of milk-giving cows along with their beautiful calves to thatassembly. The horns of the cows were encased in gold andtheir hooves in silver. Beautiful cloth decorated with goldenornaments graced their backs. Folding his hands, JanakaMahäräja addressed the sages with great humility. Whoeveramong you is brahma-vettä  (a knower of brahma ), I beg you
to come and accept these cows.
All assembled there began to whisper amongst themselves.
No one dared come forward to establish himself as brahma-
vettä  and take the cows. Again, Janaka Mahäräja looked to-
wards them, with all seriousness. This time the mahärñi
Yäjïävalkya got up and told his students, O brahmacärés ,
take these cows to my äçrama .
Hearing this, the other mahärñis  objected, saying, Are you
brahma-vettä ?
Mahärñi Yäjïavalkya said, I offer my obeisances at the50! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 138
feet of those who are brahma-vettä . If you want to examine
me or ask any question, please do so.
The various sages asked different questions and Yäjïavalkya
Mahärñi gave them befitting answers. At last, the greatlylearned Gärgé humbly inquired, Who is a kåpaëa  and who
is a brähmaëa ?
Yäjïavalkya Mahärñis response to this was: yo vä etad
akñaraà gärgy aviditväsmäl lokät praiti sa kåpaëaù (Båhad-

(miser) who leaves this world without knowing Çré Bhagavän,who is Acyuta, the Infallible Absolute Reality.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (6.9.49) it is said: kåpaëaù . . . guëa-
vastu-dåk.  Kåpaëas  are those who consider that the ultimate
reality consists only of sense objects produced from the ma-terial modes. Furthermore, it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam

Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with yadä to
explain that one becomes situated in yoga by practising
niñkäma-karma  offered to Parameçvara. When your heart
completely transcends the deep forest of delusion, you will
become indifferent to all the topics which have already been
heard and the various topics yet to be heard. If one raisesthe question, I have already become free from doubt, and I
no longer have the fault of an adverse attitude, so what need
is there for me to hear the instructions of çästra ? then
Bhagavän responds, Even so, at present it is appropriate for
you to practise at every moment this process which has been
explained by Me.

Nirveda  means that the jévas are attached to this world
because of their identification with the body. This is the root
cause of material existence. As long as this material attach-
ment remains, the jévätmä  cannot attain tattva-jïäna , nor
can he become detached from the material world. Nirveda
means to become detached from the material world . It is not
an easy achievement. Through the practice of niñkäma-
karma  offered to Bhagavän, one gradually becomes free from
the false conception that the body is the ätmä  (self). One then
achieves nirveda  (renunciation) of all types of activities about
which one has heard or will hear, and which originate from
material desires described in the çästra . Eventually, he engagesÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !141
in aikäntika-bhajana . This instruction is also in the Vedas :
parékñya lokän karma-cittän brähmaëo
nirvedam äyän nästy akåtaù kåtena
Muëòaka Upaniñad  1.2.12
A tattva-vettä brähmaëa  (a knower of the Absolute truth) attains
nirveda after understanding that the happiness and pleasure one
attains by karma  in this world or the next are temporary and
distressful.
Prahläda Mahäräja has given a similar instruction:
ädy-antavanta urugäya vidanti hi tväm
evaà vimåçya sudhiyo viramanti çabdät
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  7.9.49
O Urukrama, those who realise with discrimination that all
objects have a beginning and an end give up the study of the
Vedas and exclusively engage in bhajana to You.

Beginning from this çloka , Arjuna asks Çré Kåñëa sixteen
questions. In response, Çré Kåñëa illuminates the deep secretsof karma , karma-yoga , jïäna , jïäna-yoga , dhyäna , tapasyä ,
karma-miçrä -bhakti , jïäna-miçrä-bhakti  and çuddha-bhakti .
In this regard, Çré Kåñëa has given indications in the Eigh-teenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä  regarding prema-bhakti ,
which is the most confidential knowledge. In His conclusionto the Bhagavad-gétä , He explains that one can have entrance
into this prema-bhakti through the gateway of çaraëägati
(surrender) to Him.
The sixteen questions asked by Arjuna are as follows:
1) sthita-prajïäsya kä bhäñä (2.54).  What are the symptoms
of one who is sthita-prajïä ?
2) jyäyasé cet karmaëas te  (3.1). Why engage me in this

8) kià tad brahma kim adhyätmaà  (8.1-2). What are  brahma ,

sthita-prajïa , a person of steady intelligence.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Now, Çré Bhagavän, from this çloka beginning with
prajahäti  until the end of the chapter, answers four of
Arjunas questions in sequence. Sarvän  denotes one who does
not have a scent of material desire. The word mano-gatän
indicates the ability to give up material desires born of a non-spiritual nature which are opposed to the dharma  of the soul.
If the nature of these desires were spiritual, it would not bepossible to give them up, just as fire cannot give up heat. Thisis because a controlled mind, after realizing the ätmä , which
is blissful by nature, becomes satisfied by the ätmä alone. The
çrutis  confirm this:

One should also study the çloka : ätmany eva ca santuñöaù

minded sage.ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !147
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
How does one who is sthita-prajïa  speak? To answer this
question, Çré Bhagavän speaks the present çloka  beginning
with duùkheñu , and also the next  çloka . Duùkheñu  means the
threefold miseries: adhyätmika , adhibhautika  and adhidaivika .
Hunger, thirst, fever, headache and so on (coming from ones
own body and mind) are adhyätmika  miseries. Adhibhautika
miseries are those caused by other living entities, such as a snake
or a tiger, and miseries such as excessive rain or natural disasters
caused by the devas are called adhidaivika . Anudvigna-manäù
refers to a person who, when faced by such miseries thinks,
I have attained these miseries due to my prärabdha-karma
(past actions) and I have to suffer them. Knowing this, he
either deliberates upon this within himself, understanding this
misery to be due to his prärabdha-karma , or he speaks openly
and without duplicity when questioned by others. In any case,
his face shows no agitation, even in the presence of these mis-
eries. This absence of disturbance is evident to those who are
expert in reading such symptoms. However, it is obvious when
an imitator artificially manifests symptoms of tolerance. Those
who are expert call him corrupted. Similarly, those who re-
main free from desires when a happy situation appears, know-
ing it to be prärabdha-bhoga (enjoyment resulting from past
actions), either contemplate this within themselves or enlighten
others. This response is also understood by learned men. In
clarifying these symptoms, the present çloka describes such per-
sons as:
1) véta-räga they remain detached from happiness;
2) véta-bhaya they remain free from the fear that entities
such as tigers, may eat them;
3) véta-krodha they do not feel anger, even towards a per-
son who comes to attack or kill them. For example, no fear56! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 148
or anger arose in Jaòa Bharata when the dacoit king Våñala
took him to the deity of Devé Kälé as a human sacrifice.

A person whose heart is not disturbed by the threefold miser-
ies: adhyätmika , adhibhautika  and adhidaivika , who is devoid
of the desire to attain happiness, and who does not become
elated when happiness comes to him, is called sthita-prajïa .
na prahåñyet priyaà präpya / nodvijet präpya cäpriyam
sthira-buddhir asammüòho / brahma-vid brahmaëi sthitaù
Gétä 5.20
A person who does not become elated when attaining that which
is favourable or dear is called sthita-prajïa .
 The example of this is the life history of Bharata
Mahäräja as described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam .
Bharata Mahäräja was worshipping Bhagavän alone in a
remote forest, after renouncing his entire kingdom. In the last
part of his life, he became attached to an infant deer and,
due to the state of his mind when he left his body, he then
took birth as a deer. However, because he remembered his
previous birth, he remained separate from the association of
family and friends, and spent his time in the hermitages of
the sages, hearing topics of Çré Bhagavän. As a result of his
worship of Bhagavän in his previous life, he took his nextbirth in the house of a religiously devoted  brähmaëa . Inter-
nally he always remembered Çré Bhagavän, but externally he
kept himself completely aloof by pretending to be a dullard,
even though his father tried to make him learn the Vedas .
Jaòa Bharata tolerated ill-treatment and taunts by his step-
mother, step-brothers and relatives, while remaining ecstati-
cally absorbed in the worship of Bhagavän.
Once, Våñalaräja, the king of thieves, desired a son, and he
wanted to offer to his iñöadevé  (worshipable goddess), BhadraÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !149
Kälé, a human being who was free from bodily flaws. He had
previously captured a suitable person for sacrifice, but some-
how the man had escaped. While the dacoit king was wan-
dering in search of another suitable person to sacrifice, he
saw the mahä-bhägavata  Jaòa Bharata protecting his familys
fields. The king became happy when he saw that Jaòa
Bharata was blessed with a body appropriate for the sacri-
fice. According to the rules for sacrificing a human, he fed
Jaòa Bharata nicely, decorated him with turmeric powder, gar-
lands and candana , and eventually presented him in front
of Kälé Devé as an offering. Even after seeing, hearing and
being aware of all this, parama-bhägavata  Jaòa Bharata was
neither fearful nor angry. Rather, fixed in remembrance of
Bhagavän, he remained free from anxiety.
Just as the dacoits were ready to sever Jaòa Bharatas head,
Kälé Devé herself appeared in a ferocious form, making a loud
noise. She snatched the sword from the hand of King Våñala,
and beheaded him and his servants. After drinking their
blood, she danced and played with their heads as if they wereballs. Finally, with great affection, she sent the mahä-
bhägavata  Jaòa Bharata on his way. This deity of Bhadra Kälé
is still present in Kurukñetra.
While describing this history of Jaòa Bharata in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (5.9.20), Çukadeva Gosvämé says to Parékñit
Mahäräja: Bhagavän Çré Viñëu, who carries the sudarçana-
cakra , is death to death personified, and is always anxious
to look after His bhaktas.  O Viñëuräta, He completely pro-
tects such parama-bhägavata paramahaàsas , who have be-
come free from falsely identifying the body as the self, who
have performed the very difficult task of severing the knot
of mundane attachment, whose hearts are anxiously absorbed
in thoughts of doing welfare to all living entities, and who
neither harm others nor feel enmity towards them. Such57! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 150
paramahaàsas who accept the shelter of Çré Bhagaväns fear-
less lotus feet are never disturbed, even at the time of their
own execution. There is nothing surprising about this.

Here, the word anabhisnehaù  means free from all affec-

palatable food, nor do they glorify those from whom they
receive them by saying, You are a highly dharmika person-
ality who has been rendering service to great paramahaàsas .
May you be happy. Conversely, when they are faced withan unpleasant situation such as being dishonoured or at-tacked, they do not feel any aversion, nor do they curse their
adversary, saying, You sinful person! May you go to hell!ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !151
The intelligence of such a person is completely fixed, or situ-

Affection is of two types: (1) related with the body, sopädhika-
sneha and (2) related with Çré Bhagavän, nirupädhika-sneha .
Sopädhika-sneha  can be seen in ordinary persons who iden-
tify themselves with their bodies. Those who are sthita-prajïa
are free from identification with their bodies, and are, there-fore, devoid of sopädhika-sneha.  They are endowed with
nirupädhika-sneha , and are the well-wishers of all living
entities. This sneha  is ever-existing and continuously flow-
ing within their hearts, but it rarely manifests externally. Itis seen in some special circumstances, although an ordinaryperson cannot detect it.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
If one raises a doubt that even foolish or less intelligent
persons may become detached from the objects of their sensesby fasting or through sickness, Çré Bhagavän clarifies Hispoint in this çloka  beginning with viñayäù . The word rasa-
varjam  implies that such persons do not become free from
the desire for sense objects. Rather, their taste for sense ob-jects still persists. One who is sthita-prajïa , however, ceases
to desire sense objects because he has direct realisation ofParamätmä. There is no flaw in this definition. Those whoare able to realise the self are still sädhakas . They are not
siddhas  (perfected souls).
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Sometimes an ordinary person restricts his senses because
of disease, or by practising hatha-yoga  or fasting. Still the
desire to enjoy the sense objects remains in his heart. It isimpossible to eliminate this desire without bhakti  to Çré
Bhagavän.
In this regard, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura writes as fol-
lows: The practice of ceasing to indulge in the objects of thesenses through the process of nirähära  (forcibly keeping aloof
from sense objects) is only for extremely unintelligent people.This practice is followed by jévas who identify the self with
the body. Añöäìga-yoga  also provides an opportunity for those
who are less intelligent to become renounced from senseobjects, by engaging in yama , niyama , äsana , präëäyäma  and
pratyähara . This process is not acceptable for one who is
sthita-prajïa . After directly seeing the beauty of parama-tattva
Bhagavän, one who is sthita-prajïa  becomes attracted to Him
and gives up all attachments to ordinary sense objects. Eventhough there is provision for extremely unintelligent personsto withdraw their senses from sense objects by the process60! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 154
of nirähära , still jévas  cannot attain eternal auspiciousness
without the process of räga-märga . When a person reaches the
stage of räga (attachment to Kåñëa), he realises a superior sense
object and, thus, naturally gives up inferior pleasures.

It is beyond the capacity of the sädhaka  to have complete
control over his senses in the stage of sädhana , but the endeav-
our alone is commendable. Çré Bhagavän speaks the present
çloka , beginning with the word yatataù , to explain this. Here
the word pramäthéni  means those things which cause agitation.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The duty of a sädhaka  is to endeavour very carefully to achieve
control over his senses. One cannot become sthita-prajïa
without sense control. It is as difficult to have complete con-
trol over the flickering senses, which are always agitated, as
it is to control the wind. However, according to the instruc-ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !155
tions of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, even this difficult task
becomes very easy when one engages all his senses in theservice of Çré Bhagavän.
One can learn how to engage his controlled senses in the
service of Çré Bhagavän from the daily activities of KingAmbaréña, which are described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam :

Ambaréña Mahäräja always engaged in the worship of Çré
Kåñëa by fixing his mind in remembering His lotus feet, byengaging his tongue in describing the name, form, qualitiesand pastimes of Çré Bhagavän, his ears in hearing the topicsof Bhagavän, his eyes in seeing His beautiful Deity form, hissense of touch in experiencing the happiness of serving thefeet of the bhaktas  of Bhagavän, his nostrils in smelling the

Here, the word mat-paraù  means My bhakta , because there
is no other way of conquering the senses than by performingbhakti unto Me. This fact is apparent everywhere in the later
sections of Bhagavad-gétä . As Uddhava says in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.29.2-3):
präyaçaù puëdarékäkña / yuïjanto yogino manaù

O lotus-eyed Kåñëa, yogés  are generally unsuccessful in control-
ling their minds and so, after endeavouring for a short time,
they become tired and frustrated. Therefore, those who areÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !157
expert in discerning between what is substantial and what is
insubstantial take exclusive shelter of Your lotus feet, which
give unlimited pleasure to everyone, as the foundation of theirhappiness.
To show the difference between a sädhaka  and one who is
sthita-prajïa , Çré Kåñëa says vaçe hi , which indicates that the
senses of one who is sthita-prajïa  are under control.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
One can escape the disturbance of a gang of dacoits by
taking shelter of a valiant king. When the dacoits becomeaware of the shelter this person has taken, they become sub-
ordinate to him. Similarly, the senses of a jévätmä  are com-
pared to a gang of dacoits, and they automatically becomecontrolled when he accepts the shelter of AntaryäméBhagavän, Çré Håñékeça. Therefore, one should control onessenses in a simple, natural way by bhakti  alone. It is said in
çästra :
håñékeçe håñékäëi / yasya sthairya-gatäni hi
sa eva dhairyam äpnoti / saàsäre jéva-caïcale
Caitanya-caritämåta , Madhya-lélä  24.184
It is very difficult to control the agitated senses in this world,
but for those who engage all their senses in the service ofBhagavän Çré Håñékeça, the master of the senses, their sensesnaturally become stable and controlled.

Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa says, Control of the mind is the fun-
damental means by which those who are sthita-prajïa  con-
trol their external senses. Hear from Me, O Arjuna, what
happens when one is unable to fully control his mind. The
present çloka  beginning with dhyäyataù  is spoken to explain
this topic. By meditation on sense objects, one develops saìga ,
attachment, from which comes käma , excessive desire for
those objects. Anger ( krodha ), then arises if the fulfilment
of this desire is obstructed for some reason.

Anger gives rise to delusion, and from delusion comes loss of
memory, forgetting the instructions of çästra . Loss of memory de-
stroys intelligence, and when the intelligence is destroyed, every-
thing is lost and one again becomes fallen in the ocean of materialexistence.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
From anger comes delusion ( sammoha ), in which there is a
loss of discrimination between what is to be done and what is
not to be done. When the jéva is in a deluded condition, he
forgets the instructions of çästra (småti-vibramaù ), which are
the cause of auspiciousness for him. When his memory is lost,
proper conduct of the intelligence is lost ( buddhi-näçaù ). Af-
ter that, the sädhaka again falls into the well of material life.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The mind indeed is the king, the ruler and the impelling
cause of the senses. Therefore, by controlling the mind theexternal senses are automatically controlled. Thus, in the
Vedas  it is said:
yadä pancävatiñöhante jïänäni manasä saha
buddhiç ca na viceñöati täm ähuù paramäà gatim
Kaöha Upaniñad  2.3.10
If one can control his païca-jïänendriya  (five knowledge-acquir-
ing senses), his mind and his intelligence, he attains the su-
preme destination. Otherwise, if the mind and other senses arenot subdued, one has to wander in the cycle of birth and death.
This is also stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.21.19-21):
viñayeñu guëädhyäsät / puàsaù saìgas tato bhavet
saìgät tatra bhavet kämaù / kämäd eva kalir nåëäm
When one contemplates the qualities of sense objects, attach-
ment arises. From attachment, desires ensue, and unfulfilled64! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 160
desires lead to quarrel.
kaler durviñahaù krodhas / tamas tam anuvartate
tamasä grasyate puàsaç / cetanä vyäpiné drutam
From quarrel, unrestrained anger arises, anger causes delusion,
and when one is in delusion, the wisdom to discriminate be-tween right and wrong vanishes.
tayä virahitaù sädho / jantuù çünyäya kalpate
tato sya svärtha-vibhraàço / mürcchitasya måtasya ca
O gentle one, due to his loss of discrimination, a man becomes
like inert matter, and from that condition, he slides down tostates of unconsciousness (inertness) and becomes almost dead.Thus the supreme purpose of life is defeated.
If someone forcibly tries to subdue his external senses with-
out controlling his mind the results are extremely unpleas-ant. In order to control the mind, it is imperative to direct itto worshipping Bhagavän by following specific practices.
Consequently, Çré Bhagaväns statement in Gétä (2.61): täni
sarväëi saàyamya , is completely logical.

A man of controlled senses, however, who is free from attach-ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !161

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Previously Arjuna asked, How does one who is sthita-prajïa
behave? In response to this question, Çré Bhagavän speaksthis çloka  beginning with räga. Since the mind cannot di-
rectly accept sense objects, there is no fault in accepting senseobjects with controlled senses. Vidheyätmä means one whose
ätmä (mind) is fixed in the instructions of Bhagavän.
Prasädam adhigacchati  implies that there is no fault if such
qualified persons accept sense objects. Rather, it is specifi-cally to their credit, because they see that everything is re-lated to Bhagavän. One who is sthita-prajïa  may or may not
give up sense objects, and may or may not be motivated toattain them. In any case, everything is auspicious for him.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Even when the external senses are controlled by keeping
them aloof from the sense objects, the mind does not stopthinking of them. Such renunciation is called phalgu  (use-
less) or markaöa-vairägya  (monkey renunciation). This is
stated in Gétä 3.6: karmendriyäëi saàyamya . When a sädhaka
practises appropriate renunciation  (yukta-vairägya ) and wor-
ships Çré Bhagavän, he can control his mind and absorb it inthinking of his worshipable deity. When he has reached sucha stage, there is no fault in accepting those sense objects whichare favourable to his practice, and rejecting those which areunfavourable.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Buddhiù paryavatiñöhate  means that, in all respects his
intelligence becomes stable and fixed on the desired goal.Thus, he remains happy whether he accepts sense objectsor not. Prasanna-cetasaù  indicates that it should be un-
derstood that internal happiness will come only from
bhakti , because without bhakti  the heart cannot become
pleased. This has been explained vividly in the First Cantoof Çrémad-Bhägavatam , which describes how Vyäsadevas
mind was not happy, even after he had compiled Vedänta-
sütra . However, after he followed the instructions of Çré
Närada, his heart became blissful through the exclusivepractice of bhakti .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The heart can be pleased only by bhakti , rendering loving
devotional service to Çré Bhagavän. Bhakti  removes all miser-
ies, and in a very short period a person who practises bhakti
easily becomes fully fixed at the lotus feet of his iñöadeva .
This is also described in the dialogue between Vyäsa andNärada in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  from dhåta-vratena hi mayä
(1.4.28) to yamädibhir yoga-pathaiù käma-lobha-hato muhuùÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !163
(1.6.35). When the sädhaka practises yama and niyama on
the path of añöäìga-yoga  (the eight stages of yoga), the mind,
which is always under the control of lust and greed, attains
a certain le vel of happiness and peace. However, there is no
comparison between this and the immediate and immense plea-sure attained by service to Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa ( Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  1.6.35)
In this regard, it is worth deliberating on the examples of
Saubhari Åñi, Yayäti Mahäräja, Viçvämitra Muni and others.Saubhari Åñi was still unable to control his mind even afterperforming austerities within the water of the Yamunä for tenthousand years. His mind became agitated by seeing fish en-
gaging in sex life. He emerged from the water to marry the fifty
daughters of Mändhätä Mahäräja, but his lust still remainedunsatiated even after enjoying with them by expanding him-self into fifty forms. Eventually, he attained his desired goal bycontrolling his senses through the worship of Çré Bhagavän.
Yayäti Mahäräja was not able to control his mind, despite
various endeavours. He exchanged his old age for the youthof his son Puru, and enjoyed for many years, but his lustydesires increased, just as ghee nourishes fire. He could onlyattain peace when he had finally fixed his mind in the wor-ship of Bhagavän.
Although Viçvämitra Muni engaged in severe austerities by
practising çama  (mind control) and dama  (sense control) and
subduing his senses, he still abandoned his austerities just uponhearing Menakäs ankle bells and became absorbed in lust-ful activity. His agitated mind eventually found peace onlyin the worship of Bhagavän.
This conclusion is specifically verified in the dialogue between
Vyäsa and Närada in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam .
Veda-Vyäsa had already divided the Vedas  into four parts
and had compiled Mahäbhärata , the Puräëas  and Vedänta-66! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 164
sütra and although he had described knowledge of dharma
and other such topics for the information of people in general,
his mind remained unsatisfied. Unable to understand why,
he inquired from his spiritual master, Devarñi Närada. ÇréNärada answered:
çré närada uväca
bhavatänudita-präyaà / yaço bhagavato malam
yenaiväsau na tuñyeta / manye tad darçanaà khilam

Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.5.8-9
O great sage, you have described the processes of dharma  and
jïäna , which I consider to be incomplete and insignificant, but
you have not clearly described the topics of Çré Bhagaväns most
purifying pastimes and their glories. Çré Bhagavän cannot be
pleased unless one glorifies such pastimes, which manifest them-selves in the purified mind by the performance of bhakti .
Following the instructions of Närada Muni, by perform-
ing bhakti-yoga , Vyäsa was able to see in his pure heart all
of Çré Kåñëas beautiful pastimes, full of aiçvarya  (opulence)
and mädhurya  (sweetness). Çrémad-Bhägavatam  consists of
the activities of Çré Kåñëa which Vyäsa realised in samädhi .

By the culture of hearing and following this Çrémad-Bhägavatam ,
bhakti  to Vrajendra-nandana Çré Kåñëa immediately manifests
in the heart, dispelling lamentation, delusion and fear. Only thenis Çré Kåñëa captured in the heart of such a bhakta .ÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !165

intelligence) and is unable to meditate on Parameçvara.Abhävayataù  means that one who does not meditate cannot
have peace. In other words, he cannot become detached fromthe objects of the senses. A disturbed person can find neitherhappiness nor pleasure in the self.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
It is natural for one who is sthita-prajïa  to control the
senses. For this reason, Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka
beginning with yä. Intelligence is of two types: ätma-pravaëä ,
intelligence inclined towards the self or conscious reality, and69! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 168
viñaya-pravaëä , intelligence inclined towards material sense
objects. Intelligence which is ätma-pravaëä  is like night for
all conditioned jévätmäs . Just as a sleeping person does not
know what happens at night, similarly the bewildered jévas
do not know what one attains by ätma-pravaëä buddhi . But
one who is sthita-prajïa  remains awake in such a night, so
he directly experiences the bliss related to intelligence fixedin the conscious reality.
The conditioned jévas  remain awake in viñaya-pravaëä
buddhi  and they experience lamentation, bewilderment and
so on, according to their respective absorption. They are notasleep to it. Sthita-prajïa munis , however, do not experience
anything in such a night. They remain indifferent to the senseobjects that give happiness and distress to materialistic per-sons and, remaining detached, only accept those sense ob-jects which are needed for their maintenance.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Those who are sthita-prajïa  naturally achieve perfection
in controlling all the senses. They are jïäné puruñas (knowl-
edgeable persons) in the real sense. On the other hand, the
intelligence of ignorant people who identify the body with
the ätmä  remains absorbed in sense objects. Such persons who
are attached to sense objects are called materialistic, or ig-
norant. Ajïänaà tu niçä proktä divä jïänam udéryate.
Knowledge is like day and ignorance is like night ( Skanda
Puräëa ).
Everything in the kingdom of that most wonderful Çré
Bhagavän is wonderful. What is night for one person is dayfor another. For an owl, night is like day, while for a crow it
is night. An owl sees only at night, not during the day. Simi-
larly, a man blinded by ignorance cannot have vision of the
illumination of tattva-jïäna . Knowers of the Absolute, how-
ever, always see Çré Bhagavän, the radiant personification ofÇLOKA SÄÌKHYA -YOGA !169

Just as a lotus leaf never becomes wet even though it remains
in water, similarly, one who is sthita-prajïa  never becomes
attached to sense objects, even while he is living in contact
with them.

Nirleptä , or remaining unattached to sense objects, indicates
that one does not become disturbed even after coming in con-tact with a sense object. Çré Bhagavän explains this idea by70 - 71! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  2 170
speaking this çloka  beginning with äpüryamäëam . Although
different rivers pour so much water into the ocean during therainy season, they cannot cause it to overflow. Acala-
pratiñöham  means whose boundary is not crossed. Similarly,
various sense objects also present themselves to one who issthita-prajïa . But, just as water pouring into or flowing out
of the ocean makes no difference to the ocean, similarly, thosewho remain unaffected both while they are utilising senseobjects, and when they are bereft of them, are called sthita-
prajïa . Only they attain çänti , that is, jïäna.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän is now concluding the chapter with this çloka
beginning with the word eñä. Attaining the state of brahma  is
called brähmé . If brahma-nirväëa  (spiritual emancipation) is
achieved at the time of death by attaining the state of brahma
for a moment, then what can be said of the result if the prac-tice to attain this state has been performed since childhood?
Jïäna and karma are specifically explained in this chap-
ter and bhakti is explained indirectly. Therefore, this chap-
ter is called the summary of Çré Gétä.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
This Third Chapter gives a detailed explanation of action
(karma ) offered to Çré Bhagavän without expecting any
material return ( niñkäma-bhäva ). It also describes the wisdom
of a person who is willing to conquer lust, anger and so forth.
From the çlokas  in the previous chapter, Arjuna has under-
stood that guëätétä bhakti-yoga , which bestows freedom from
the guëas (nistrai-guëya ), is superior both to jïäna-yoga  and
to niñkäma-karma-yoga . Now, in the mood of a friend ( sakhya-
bhäva ), he reproaches Çré Bhagavän, who is eager to engage
him in his prescribed duty of fighting, with the following
words. If that intelligence which is resolute ( vyavasäyätmikä )
and free from the guëas  (guëätétä ) is superior, then why, O
Janärdana, are You engaging me in this ghastly warfare?  Jana
means to Your own people and ärdana  means giving pain, so
Janärdana means by Your order You give pain to Your ownpeople.
Arjuna also addresses Kåñëa as Keçava. No one can trans-
gress Your order, because You are Keçava, the controller of bothBrahmä and Mahädeva ( ka means Brahmä, éça means
Mahädeva and va means controller).

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In this çloka  there is a mysterious secret behind Arjunas
addressing Çré Kåñëa by the names Keçava and Janärdana.Arjuna inquired, O Janärdana, first You said that resoluteintelligence ( vyavasäyätmikä buddhi ), which is beyond the
modes ( guëätétä ) and fixed in bhakti , is superior to karma
(action). Why, then, are You engaging me in this ghastly
warfare? Learned men are right in calling You Janärdana, forby Your order You give pain to Your own people who are dearto You and dependent on You. Janärdana is a very befittingname for You because You killed the asura  named Jana, which
is another indication of Your cruel nature. Keçava is anotherÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !175 2
appropriate name, because You killed the asura Keçé. More-
over, ka means Brahmä, éça means Mahädeva and va means
controller. Since You control them, You are called Keçava.
How, then, can an insignificant person such as I transgress
Your order? O Prabhu, be merciful to me!
In Çré Harivaàça  Çré Rudra (Çaìkara) says in relation to
Çré Kåñëa and His name, Keçava:
ka iti brahmaëo näma / éço haà sarva-dehinäm

Ka is Brahmä and I am éça (Çaìkara), the controller of all living

Çré Bhagavän is telling His friend, O sakhe Arjuna! It is a
fact that guëätétä bhakti  is the most superior process because
it is transcendental. But such bhakti  can only be attained by! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 176
the mercy of My mahä-bhakta  who is independent (transcen-
dental to the guëas ) and aikäntika  (one-pointed). It can never
be attained by ones own endeavour. Therefore, become
nistrai-guëya (free from the guëas ). I bless you that you will
become nistrai-guëya  by performing transcendental bhakti
(guëätétä bhakti ) to Me. When this blessing fructifies, you
will achieve guëätétä bhakti  by the mercy of an independent
and aikäntika-mahä-bhägavat , but, as I have already said, at
present your eligibility ( adhikära ) is to perform karma  only.
Arjuna then says, If this is so, why dont You definitively
tell me to engage only in karma ? Why are You drowning me
in an ocean of doubts? This is why Arjuna is speaking this
çloka  beginning with vyämiçreëeva , which has various im-
plications. He is saying, By such statements You are bewil-
dering my intelligence. Moreover, initially You said: karmaëy
evädhikäras te (Gétä  2.47). You only have the adhikära  to
perform karma , your prescribed duty. Then You said: siddhy-
asiddhyoù samo bhütvä samatvaà yoga ucyate (Gétä  2.48).
That equanimity in which one remains equipoised in success
and failure is called yoga. Then again, You said: buddhi-yukto
jahätéha ubhe sukåta-duñkåte tasmäd yogäya yujyasva yogah
karmasu kauçalam (Gétä  2.50). Intelligent persons abandon
both pious and impious activities and, because buddhi -yoga
is the highest goal of karma , they endeavour for niñkäma-
karma . Here, by the word yoga , You are also referring to
jïäna . Then You say: yadä te moha-kalilaà buddhir
vyatitariñyati  (Gétä 2.52). When your intelligence crosses
beyond the dense forest of delusion. Here again, You are sim-
ply speaking about jïäna.
In fact, the word iva (like that or it seems) implies that
Your statement is not ambiguous. Since You are merciful, it
is not Your desire to bewilder me. Besides, since I am not ig-norant of these matters, it is appropriate for You to speak
directly. The deep purport is that karma  (action) in sattva-ÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !177
guëa  is superior to karma  in rajo-guëa . Jïäna  is also in sattva-
guëa , but it is superior to karma  in sattva-guëa , and nirguëa-
bhakti  is far superior to jïäna . If You think that it is impos-
sible for me to engage in nirguëa-bhakti , then please simply
instruct me on sättvika jïäna , by which I will become free
from bondage to this miserable material world.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Action  (karma ) in sattva-guëa  is superior to action  in rajo-
guëa . Jïäna  is superior to karma  in sattva-guëa , although it
is also in sattva-guëa . Sattvät saìjäyate jïänam. From sattva-
guëa  real jïäna  develops ( Gétä  14.17).
Superior to jïäna  in sattva-guëa is nirguëa-bhakti , which
is defined as follows in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.29.11-12):
mad-guëa-çruti-mätreëa / mayi sarva-guhäçaye
mano-gatir avicchinnä / yathä gaìgämbhasombudhau
lakñaëaà bhakti-yogasya / nirguëasya hy udähåtam
ahaituky avyavahitä / yä bhaktiù puruñottame
While Kapiladeva was instructing His mother, Devahüti in
nirguëa-bhakti , He said, Just as the water of the Gaìgä flows
naturally and without cessation towards the ocean, similarlythat natural unbroken flow of the ätmä  towards Me, who am
situated within the cave of the heart of the living entity, merely
hearing about My pastimes and qualities, which are blessed withextraordinary potency, is called nirguëa-bhakti -yoga . Nirguëa-
bhakti  is anyäbhiläña-çünya , devoid of the duality of the material
world which arises from dvitéya-abhiniveça (forgetfulness of
Kåñëa), and it absorbs the performer favourably in continuous
service to Me, Puruñottama.
To forget Kåñëa and become absorbed in mäyä  is called
dvitéya-abhiniveça , absorption in the second or false object
(Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.2.37). This gives rise to various sepa-
rate interests, such as I, mine, you and yours.2! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 178

Çré Bhagavän said, O sinless Arjuna, I have already
explained clearly that there are two types of firm faithin this world. The faith of the 
säìkhya-vädé jïänés  is
in the path of jïäna-yoga  and that of the yogés  is in
niñkäma -karma-yoga .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In response to Arjunas question, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa says,
If I say that  niñkäma-karma-yoga  and jïäna-yoga , which
are the sädhana  performed to attain mokña , are independent
of each other, you will again ask Me to speak decisively on
one of them. But as I have explained, the two types of niñöhä
(staunch faith), karma-niñöhä  and jïäna-niñöhä , are actually
two consecutive stages on the same path. In fact, I have notsaid that there are two types of people who are eligible toachieve mokña. 
The two çlokas  beginning with the present çloka , loke smin ,
are being spoken for this reason. As explained in the previousÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !179
chapter, dvi-vidhä indicates two types of niñöhä . Regarding
this niñöhä , Kåñëa is saying that, since in the stage of jïäna
the heart of the jïäné  is pure, maryädä (regulated discipline)
can be established by the practice of jïäna-yoga . Only such
persons who accept maryädä are well known in this world
as jïänés .
In Gétä  (2.61) Çré Kåñëa says:
täni sarväëi saàyamya / yukta äséta mat-paraù
vaçe hi yasyendriyäëi / tasya prajïä pratiñöhitä
Therefore, after controlling all of their senses, the yogés should
remain under My shelter and devote themselves to Me. Only aperson in control of his senses has fixed intelligence. Only heis sthita-prajïa .
On the other hand, there are those who lack the purity of
heart to situate themselves on the path of jïäna , but are
searching for the means to attain that path. The maryädä
of such yogés  is established by following the path of niñkäma-
karma-yoga  which is offered unto Me. They are known as
karmés.  In Gétä  2.31 it is said For a kñatriya there is no bet-
ter engagement than to fight for religion. Therefore the
terms karmé  and jïäné  are only two appellations. How-
ever, generally when karmés  begin to purify their hearts by
the process of niñkäma-karma-yoga  they, too, become jïänés
who can in turn become liberated by the process of bhakti .
This is the import of My statements.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The various processes of karma , yoga, jïäna  and tapasyä
cannot give their own results independently. They are only
able to produce beneficial results by taking the support
of bhakti . Nirguëa-bhakti , however, can give kåñëa-prema
independently without the help of these other processes.

faith) related to this sädhana . The first is possessed by those
with pure hearts, who ascend the path of bhakti-yoga  through
their steady faith in säìkhya  or jïäna-yoga . The second is
the faith of those whose hearts are impure, but who, by per-forming niñkäma-karma  offered to Çré Bhagavän, can also
ascend the path of jïäna-yoga  and ultimately achieve bhakti .

na hi . Anticipating Arjunas question, By the acceptance of4 - 5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 182

Here, the word sannyäsa  means detachment from the fruits

becoming inactive, because it is not possible for the embod-ied soul to completely renounce activity. It is stated in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam (6.1.44), dehavän na hy akarma-kåt. Those whose
hearts are pure and who control their senses, remain engagedin that karma prescribed in çästra . However, persons whose

without desire for the fruits of ones activity. This means that
the person who acts according to the instructions of çästra
with no desire for the fruits of his activities attains a superior
condition. Çré Rämänujäcärya says: asambhävita-pramädatvena
jïäna-niñöhäd api puruñäd viçiñöah.  A householder who has
controlled his knowledge-acquiring senses ( jïänendriyas ) and
his working senses ( karmendriyas ), is better than a so-called
transcendentalist who makes a display of his knowledge. The
pseudo-transcendentalist may deviate because his senses are
uncontrolled, but there is no possibility that a householder
who has controlled his knowledge-acquiring senses will de-
viate or be careless while performing his prescribed duties with
his working senses.

In order to purify the heart, it is imperative to perform
actions prescribed in çästra  without attachment. Those
sädhakas  who, after controlling their jïänendriyas (such as
the eyes, ears and tongue), perform karma -yoga with their
karmendriyas (such as the legs, hands and speech) without de-
siring the fruits, and who are always careful and attentive,
are qualified to attain puruñärtha , the supreme goal of humanÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !185
life. Such sädhakas  who aspire for the transcendental goal
are superior to those sädhakas  who accept sannyäsa  impetu-
ously and who forcibly control their working senses whileenjoying sense objects through their knowledge-acquiringsenses.

It is by the purity of food that ones mind becomes purified and
sättvika . When the mind is purified, one attains a stable memory.
When the memory is stable, all the knots of the heart are untied.
Furthermore it is stated in Gétä  (3.13):

It is understood from this and other statements that for
the perfection of ones sädhana , it is necessary to maintain
and protect the body, which is essential for the performanceof ones sva-dharma (prescribed duties).  However, those who
impetuously give up all action by taking sannyäsa  do not see
the light of knowledge in their impure hearts. Moreover, ifthey perform no work at all, they can even leave their bod-ies due to lack of maintenance.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän says, O Arjuna, if you quote karmaëä
badhyate jantuù  from the småti-çästra  as evidence that a
jévätmä  is bound by performing action, and if you think that
you will also become bound, then listen carefully. This is notalways the case. Karma  offered to Parameçvara is not a cause
of bondage. The present çloka  beginning with yajïärthät  is
spoken to explain this. Niñkäma-dharma , performance of
ones prescribed duties wherein the fruits are offered to Çré
Viñëu, is called yajïa . All karma  (action), except for that per-
formed for the satisfaction of Viñëu, binds a person to thematerial world. Therefore, to attain perfection in dharma ,
one must perform such karma  properly for the satisfaction
of Çré Viñëu. If A rjuna again asks, Will it be a cause of bond-
age to make an offering which is materially motivated, eventhough I am offering the results of my prescribed duties toÇré Viñëu? Çré Kåñëa answers, mukta-saìgaù.  Perform ac-

forbidden activity, attains neither heaven nor hell. Such a per-son, who is situated in his sva-dharma , who has given up all9! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 188

The Vedas  say: yajïo vai viñëuù. Yajïa  is indeed Viñëu.
Çré Kåñëa also tells Uddhava in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.19.39):
yajïo ham bhagavattamaù. I, the son of Vasudeva, am yajïa .
The T antra-sära  also states yajïa  to be Çré Hari Himself:
yajïo yajïa-pumänç caiva yajïaço yajïa-bhävanaù
yajïa-bhuk ceti païcätmä yajïeñv ijyo hariù svayam
In the two çlokas of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.20.10-11),
which Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has cited in hiscommentary on the present çloka , the word sva-dharma-stha
(situated in ones prescribed duties) has been used twice. While
commenting on these two çlokas , Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté
Öhäkura says:
1) One does not go to hell if he is situated in his sva-dharma
and does not transgress the activities prescribed in çästra , that
is, he does not engage in forbidden activities. And, since he
has no desire for the fruits of his activities, he does not go to
Svarga (heaven) either.
2) A person who engages in niñkäma-karma  is called sva-
dharma-stha .
When karma  is performed in accordance with çästra , without
any selfish motive and for the pleasure of Çré Viñëu, it purifies
the heart. Sädhu-saìga  then causes bhagavat-tattva  to appear in
the heart, allowing one to enter the path of nirguëa-bhakti .
Devarñi Närada has also said this in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(1.5.32):
etat saàsücitaà brahmaàs / täpa-traya-cikitsitam
yad éçvare bhagavati / karma brahmaëi bhävitamÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !189
O knower of brahma , that karma  which is dedicated to the lotus
feet of Çré Bhagavän, the controller and master of everyone,removes the three types of miseries.
Çré Bhagavän also told the Pracetäs:

Çré Bhagavän says, A person with an impure heart should
exclusively engage in niñkäma-karma  and not take sannyäsa ,
but if in his present state he cannot become niñkäma , then let
him perform sakäma-karma (fruitive action) and offer the
results to Çré Viñëu. To explain this, Çré Kåñëa speaks seven
çlokas , the first of which begins here with the word saha.  Saha-
yajïa  means along with sacrifice. In accordance with the süta-
vikalpe-upasarjana , saha has not been replaced with sa.
Purä  implies that in the beginning of creation, Brahmä
produced progeny who would perform yajïa  in the form of
dharmika  activities offered to Çré Viñëu, and then blessed
them, saying, anena dharmena prasaviñyadhvam. By this
dharma  may you become increasingly prosperous in terms of
progeny and opulence. Keeping in mind the tendency of the
progeny to enjoy, Lord Brahmä said, Let this yajïa  fulfil all

you. In this context the word bhäva means préti, pleasing.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In this çloka , Bhagavän instructs that, to please the devas ,
oblations of ghee are to be offered to them. This has a hid-den meaning. Bhagavän is not instructing us to give up ourdevotional service and make sacrificial offerings to worshipthe devas , as if they are independent lords. They are not inde-
pendent. Çré Viñëu empowers qualified jévätmäs  and, giving
them the post of protectors of the directions, He maintainsthe universe through them. Thus, these devas  are like the limbs
of Çré Bhagavän. It is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.11.26):
bähavo loka-pälänäm. The arms of Çré Kåñëa are the shelter
for all of the administrative devas  of the world. Again it is
said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.1.29): indrädayo bähava ähur
usräù. Devas  such as Indra are the arms of the viräö-puruña ,
the Lords universal form.
Regarding Indra-püjä, it is seen in  Çrémad-Bhägavatam  that
the residents of Vraja used to worship him every year, but Çré
Kåñëa asked them to worship the mountain Giri Govardhanainstead. When Indras arrogance was crushed, he acceptedthat it was due to pride in his aiçvarya  (opulence) that he
considered himself an independent lord. Çré Bhagavän showedhim great mercy by removing his false ego. Indra said, Now,having realised that I am the servant of the servant of Your11! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 192

that the devas  who protect the various directions are the limbs
of the viräö-puruña (universal form) .

Failure to perform karma  is certainly a defect. Çré Bhagavän

the water-pot and the broom. The word sünä  means the place
where animals are slaughtered. These five household objects

Çré Bhagavän says, It is still desirable to perform  yajïa ,
because it maintains the cycle of action in this material
world. To ex press this, Çré Bhagavän speaks the çloka begin-
ning with the word  annäd.  Living entities take birth  from food
grains, thus food grains are the cause of living entities. Grainis transformed into blood which then turns into semen, which
in turn forms the body of the living entity. Clouds are the
source of food grains, which are produced from rain. Yajïa  is
the cause of the clouds, because when yajïa  is performed,
sufficient rain clouds are produced. The cause of the yajïa  is
karma (action), because a yajïa  is perfectly executed when the
åtvik  (priest) of the yajïa  and the yajamäna  (he on whose
behalf the yajïa is performed) both fulfil the prescribed karma .

The Vedas are the cause of that karma (yajïa ), because
yajïa  is performed only after hearing Vedic injunctions.
Akñara-brahma , or Acyuta, the imperishable Absolute Real-
ity, is the cause of the Vedas , because they originated from
brahma . In this regard it is said in the Vedas  (çrutis ):
asya mahato bhütasya niùçvasitam etad

This statement also establishes that one can attain brahma
by yajïa . Although a connection of cause and effect has been
shown here by linking food grains to brahma , in çästra , only
yajïa  is described as the governing factor and only yajïa  is
glorified. Manu-småti also says: Oblations offered in the fire

By not engaging in this cycle, the fault of irregularity arises.
The present çloka  beginning with evam  is spoken to give an
understanding of this point. Cakra , or cycle, means an ordered
series of events. For example, clouds and rain come from yajïa ,
food grains come from rains, and from food grains come theliving beings (men) who again perform yajïa , which produces
rain clouds and so on. One who does not engage in yajïa  to
continue this cycle is aghäyuù , a sinful person. Who does not

of the universe, become servants of their senses, which engagethem in sinful life. Thus they live in vain. The significanceis that there is no consideration of sin or piety in niñkäma-
karma-yoga  which is offered to Çré Bhagavän, because çästra
has established this as the most suitable path to attainnirguëa-bhakti  of Bhagavän. A person following this path
easily becomes pure at heart and free from material contami-nation. Those who have not acquired the adhikära to offer
this niñkäma-karma-yoga  to Çré Bhagavän are always swayed
by material desires and sensual urges and thus engage in sin-ful acts. The only way to reduce this sinful tendency is toperform puëya-karma.  Those who have acted sinfully should
only take shelter of atonement.  The provision of yajïa  is
certainly dharma , pious activity. That which is auspicious for
all jévas and conducive for the harmonious development ofÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !199
the cycle of the universe, is called puëya , or pious deeds. The
performance of puëya destroys the unavoidable sins that are
born of païca-sünä . So long as the performer of yajïa protects
the interests and welfare of the universe, whatever can be
accepted for his happiness and personal enjoyment becomes
part of the yajïa , and is counted as piety.
The unseen controllers who cause auspiciousness for the
universe are the specific devas  born from the çakti  of Çré
Bhagavän. By satisfying them with the offerings they desireand gaining their favour, one pleases these devas  and all sins
are destroyed. This is called the karma-cakra . Thus, karma ,
which is accepted in the form of worship of these devas , is
called bhagavat-arpita kämya-karma , or sakäma upäsanä
(worship with fruitive desires). Some people falsely believe thatthey are righteous and religious, even though they do not of-fer their karma  to Çré Viñëu, and are not devotionally inclined.
They perform action, but disregard any form of deva worship,
because they think that it is mundane. Such people are them-selves simply following mundane morality. It is therefore aus-picious for the jévas of the world who are thus eligible not to
follow these deluded religionists, but to perform bhagavat-
arpita kämya-karma .

However, a person who delights in the self, and who remains
contented and satisfied in the self, has no duties to perform.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
So far, it has been explained that those who are unable to
perform niñkäma-karma  should perform sakäma-karma .
Those who are situated on the platform of jïäna , realised
knowledge, never engage in the routine of kämya-karma
(sakäma karma ), because their hearts are pure . The next two
çlokas , beginning here with yas tu , are spoken to explain this.
Ätma-ratiù  means ätmäräma , taking pleasure in the self.
Ätma-tåptaù  refers to those who remain satisfied simply by
realizing the pleasure of the self. If one is satisfied within theätmä itself, would he be even slightly satisfied with external
sense objects? In response Çré Bhagavän says, One who issatisfied within has no need for external sense pleasures, and
is therefore not obliged to perform prescribed duties.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Living entities who exist in the cycle of karma , which has
been described above, perform karma , knowing it to be
obligatory. However, those who can dis criminate between the
self and inert objects engage solely in the cultivation of theself. They remain content within the self, because they areätmäräma  (able to take pleasure in the self) and äptakäma
(able to satisfy all their desires in the self). Such mahä-puruñas
are of two types: 1) the jïäné-yogés  who search for the ätmä  and
2) the bhakti -yogés  who cultivate the path of bhagavat-prema .
Personalities like the four Kumäras (Sanaka, Sanandana,Sanätana and Sanat-Kumära) are considered to be in the firstcategory, while personalities like Devarñi Närada fall in thesecond. They do not perform karma , although they know it is
their obligatory duty, but perform actions which are favourable
to bhakti  simply to maintain their lives. Becoming free fromÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !201
the cycle of karma , they search for peace through bhagavat-
préti (affection for Bhagavän) . Although they perform all
sorts of karma , they do nothing. Therefore, their karma  is
not called karma . Their karma  (activity) is called jïäna  or
bhakti , depending on their adhikära . It is also said in Muëòaka
Upaniñad  (3.1.4): ätma-kréòa ätma-ratiù kriyävän eña brahma-
vidäà variñöhaù. Those who take pleasure in the self, whose
attachment is in the self, and who are active only in the self,
are the best among the knowers of the Vedas .

Kåta  refers to a person who neither has interest in perform-

him. The word vyapäçrayaù  has been described in the Puräëas
as follows:
väsudeve bhagavati / bhaktim udvahatäà nåëäm
jïäna-vairägya-véryäëäà / na hi kaçcid vyapäçrayaù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam 6.17.31
A person endowed with bhakti  for Bhagavän Väsudeva does not
take shelter of jïäna , vairägya or vérya (powerful strength), nor
is he interested in them.
Moreover, it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.4.18): yad-
apäçrayäçrayäù çudhyanti. A living entity becomes purified
merely by taking shelter of those who are surrendered to ÇréBhagavän.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
A person who derives pleasure only within the self
(ätmäräma ) neither achieves piety by performing his prescribed
duties, nor does he become implicated in sin by not perform-
ing them. Every jéva, both moving and non-moving, begin-
ning with Brahmä, remains absorbed in enjoying material
happiness due to his misconception of identifying the bodywith the self. His every action is performed for sense enjoy-
ment. He does not even care for jïäna  and vairägya , which
are the shelter of the tyagés. This is because he has taken
shelter of bhakti , the natural function of the self. Jïäna  and
vairägya , which are both subordinate to bhakti , manifest in
him as a matter of course.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.42), Çré Kavi speaks to Mahäräja
Nimi:
bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir
anyatra caiña trika eka-kälaù
prapadyamänasya yathäçnataù syus
tuñöiù puñöiù kñud-apäyo nu-ghäsam
With each mouthful of food that a hungry person takes, threeÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !203
effects are simultaneously accomplished: he obtains satisfaction,
he is nourished and his hunger ceases. Similarly, surrendered
souls who are engaged in the performance of bhajana simulta-
neously experience three effects: the awakening of bhakti which
ultimately develops into prema , direct manifestation of
Bhagaväns beloved form, and detachment from material objects.
One may raise the following question: In the Vedas  it is
said: tasmäd tan na priyam yad etan manuñyä viduù. The
devas  do not want human beings to attain knowledge of
brahma . (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad  1.4.10) It is also seen
in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.18.14):
viprasya vai sannyasato / devä därädi-rüpiëaù
vighnän kurvanty ayaà hy asmän / äkramya samiyät param
Knowing that brähmaëas  will surpass them by taking sannyäsa
and obtaining brahma-tattva , the devas  take birth to become their
wives or children and to create obstacles in their path.
Thus, is it proper to worship the devas  to eliminate these
obstacles?
In this regard, the çrutis  state that, even though the devas
present these obstacles, they are, in fact, unable to harm thespiritual aspirants, because the ätmä  itself protects them. This
ätmä  is the ätmä  of all ätmäs , Paramätmä.
väsudeva-parä vedä / väsudeva-parä makhäù
väsudeva-parä yogä / väsudeva-paräù kriyäù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam 1.2.28
According to this statement, Väsudeva Kåñëa is the origi-
nal ätmä of all other ätmäs . By performing bhajana  to Him
one can gain the affection of everyone. All the devas  are
ultimately compelled to show affection and respect to thosewho have kåñëa-bhakti .
In addition it is stated: bhaktis tu bhagavad-bhakta-saìgena18! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 204
parijäyate. One attains bhakti  only by the association of
bhaktas . According to this statement of çästra , just as Çré
Bhagavän is the only suitable shelter for the bhaktas , it is
similarly necessary to take shelter of His bhaktas if one de-
sires bhakti . For this reason, Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (6.23)
states:
yasya deve parä bhaktir / yathä deve tathä gurau
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäù / prakäçante mahätmanaù
All the essential purports of çästra are revealed only in the heart
of a mahätmä  who has parä bhakti to Çré Bhagavän and as he has
devotion for Bhagavän similarly he has çuddha-bhakti  for Çré
Gurudeva.

if the intelligence of such ignorant persons is bewildered, they
will lose faith in karma . Under such circumstances even jïäna
will not be able to manifest in their hearts and thus they willdeviate from the paths of karma  and jïäna . However, this does
not apply to instructions on bhakti , because according to çästra ,
instructions on bhakti  are auspicious for everyone under all

sons, teachers to their disciples and kings to their subjects. Oneshould not become angry with a person who receives instructions,but does not follow them. Even those who are ignorant of tattva-
jïäna  and who are bewildered about the performance of proper duty
should not be engaged in karma. What puruñärtha (destination) will
be attained by engaging a person blinded by delusion in  kämya-karma
(fruitive activities), thus throwing him further into the dark well ofthis material world? Nothing will be achieved.
While commenting on this çloka  of Çrémad-Bhägavatam ,
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé says, If, instead of giving instructionon bhakti , someone instructs others about engaging in
karma , he incurs sin.
According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the
present çloka , (Gétä  3.26): yojayet sarva-karmäëi , is not for
those who are preaching the message of bhakti , but it is for
the consideration of those who give instructions on jïäna .27! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 214

If a learned man also has to perform karma , what is the
difference between his work and that of an ignorant man?
This doubt is being addressed. The difference is shown in
two çlokas  beginning with the present one, prakåteù
kriyamäëäni . Ignorant people believe that they themselves
perform all activity ( karma ), but in reality it is performed
by the senses, which are impelled by the modes of mate-
rial nature.

O Mahä-bäho Arjuna, one who is tattva-vit , who
knows that the soul is aloof from the guëas  and also
knows the laws of karma  (actions), does not falsely
identify himself as the doer. Because he understands
that the senses are engaged in their respective sense
objects, he is aloof from them.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Those who know the distinctive characteristics of guëa  and
karma  are called tattva-vit , knowers of the truth. There are
three categories of guëa : sattva , rajas  and tamas . The respec-
tive categories of karma are the different types of activities
which are influenced by the guëas , the devas , the various
prominent senses, and the objects of the senses. One who istattva-vit  knows the truth about both guëa  and karma . The
devas  or the guëas  preside over the respective senses, such as
sight, and also the sense objects, such as  form. However, a
learned person knows that he is not the guëas , nor is he the
effect or activity of any guëa . He has nothing to do with
the guëas  or their activities. Understanding this, a wise and
learned person does not become attached to them.

One may raise the question, If all jévas are distinct from the
guëas  and have no relationship with them and their activities,
why are they seen to be attached to sense objects? Çré Kåñëaanswers with this çloka beginning with prakåteù.  They become
bewildered by the guëas . In other words, they become deluded
because of their absorption in the guëas . Just as a man haunted
by a ghost considers himself a ghost, so the jévas absorbed in
the guëas  identify themselves as the guëas . Thus influenced
by the effect of the modes, they become attached to sense ob-jects. One who is kåtsna-vit  (a man of complete knowledge)
should not unsettle those who are akåtsna-vit  (of incomplete
knowledge). This means that a man of complete knowledgeshould not try to force these thoughts on ignorant persons bysaying, You are a jéva distinct from the guëas . You are not the
modes. Just as a person who is haunted by a ghost will neverunderstand that he is actually not a ghost but a human being,even if he is told hundreds of times. His conviction can only beremoved by the medicine of mantras . Similarly, no amount of
verbal instruction will help a bewildered jéva to stop identify-
ing himself with the modes of material nature. Such people shouldsimply be engaged in niñkäma-karma , which automatically frees
them from their absorption in the guëas. ÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !217

People may know that sinful activity will lead to pun-

After seeing the prostitute, the mind of Ajämila became agitated.
He tried hard to control his mind by fortitude and knowledgeof çästra but, being agitated by Cupid, he was unable to do so.
All uncontrolled, degraded desires can be removed by the
powerful influence of sädhu-saìga .

Saintly people can, by their powerful speech, completely cut
asunder all the unfavourable attachments of the mind.
 Vyäsaìga  means attachments which make one averse to
Çré Bhagavän. Here, the word eva implies the powerful speech
of saintly persons alone. Pious actions, holy places, devas  and
knowledge of çästra are by themselves not able to destroy
unfavourable attachments. This should be understood.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, dont think that a man of knowledge will attain auspi-ciousness (liberation from bondage) if he simply deliberateson spirit and matter, and accepts the shelter of sannyäsa-
dharma  by impetuously giving up material guëa  and karma.
Even after the baddha-jéva has become enriched with jïäna ,
he should still endeavour according to his long-acquireddisposition. It is not true that one can give up ones natureby suddenly restraining it. All baddha-jévas  should continue
to endeavour according to the disposition they have naturallyacquired over a prolonged period.  The proper way to give up
this nature is to carefully perform all karma (action) in ac-
cordance with that nature, while being situated in it. As longas vairägya enriched with the symptoms of bhakti-yoga  does
not appear in the heart, then the only means to attain self-auspiciousness is niñkäma-karma-yoga  offered to Çré33! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 222
Bhagavän. By this practice, a person can perform his pre-
scribed duties ( sva-dharma ), and also benefit from the
saàskäras  generated by them. Renunciation of ones sva-
dharma  will ultimately result in deviation from the path of
perfection.
When, by My mercy or by the mercy of My bhakta , bhakti -
yoga appears in the heart, there is no need to follow ones
sva-dharma , because this path of bhakti  is superior to
niñkäma-karma -yoga . Otherwise, if bhakti-yoga has not
awakened, to follow niñkäma-karma -yoga offered to Me is
auspicious in all cases.

Since it is beyond the control of çästra  to enforce injunc-
tions on a person who has an extremely wicked nature, oneÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !223
should not allow his senses to wander wilfully. By regularly
engaging in sinful activities, a person becomes depraved. ÇréBhagavän is speaking this çloka  beginning with the word
indriyasya  to explain this. The repetition of the word indriya
here indicates the sense objects of each respective sense. Al-
though to look at anothers wife, touch her, or allure her by
giving her gifts is forbidden in çästra , still an immoral man
is attracted to such behaviour. On the other hand, although
it is prescribed in çästra  to see, touch, serve and offer charity
to the guru , brähmaëas , holy places and guests, an impious
man is averse to such behaviour. To come under the influence
of either of these mentalities is not proper. In other words, itis not proper either to develop attachment to a woman byseeing her, or to be malicious to someone who obstructs thatattachment. Similarly, a sädhaka  on the path of self-realisation
should neither be attached to rich and palatable foodstuffswhich are to his taste, nor averse to dry, unpalatable fooditems and objects which are not to his taste. In the same way,he should not be attached to seeing and hearing about hisown son, nor should he be averse to seeing and hearing abouthis enemys son. It is inappropriate to come under the influ-ence of such attachments and aversions. This has been ex-plained.

The senses are of two types: jïänendriya  (knowledge-ac-
quiring senses) and karmendriya (working senses). There are
five jïänendriyas : the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin, which
accept form, sound, smell, taste and touch as their respective
objects of gratification. There are also five karmendriyas :
speech, hands, legs, anus and genitals, which perform theactions of speaking, accepting, moving, evacuating and
procreating. The sädhaka  of bhakti  engages these eleven
senses, including the mind, in various types of service for the34! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 224
pleasure of Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, instead of enjoying the vari-
ous sense objects himself. In this way, he can easily overpowerthe uncontrolled senses and, by the use of his controlled
senses, he can attain the supreme goal of life.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, if you think that the jévas  acceptance of sense ob-
jects will make most of them more addicted to worldliness
and that liberation from the bondage of karma  will thus
become impossible, then listen to My words. It is not truethat all objects are detrimental to the spiritual progress of
the jévas. It is only the attachment and aversion to the sense
objects which are the greatest enemies of the jéva. As long as
you have this material body, you have to accept sense objects.For this reason, you should accept sense objects, and at thesame time control attachment and aversion towards them.If you act in this way, you can deal with sense objects with-out becoming bound to them. You will become detached fromsense objects by gradually eliminating the attachment andaversion which develops when one falsely identifies the bodywith the self. In brief, you will develop yukta-vairägya . I have
not instructed you to subdue attachment to objects and ac-tivities related to Me, Çré Bhagavän, which stimulate onesbhakti . Nor have I instructed you not to be averse to objects
or activities which are obstacles to bhakti . Rather, I have only
instructed you to control that attachment and aversion whichis related to selfish pleasure and which promotes a tempera-ment that is opposed to bhakti . This should be understood.

Çré Bhagavän sees that due to attachment and aversion,
Arjuna is becoming unable to engage in his own prescribed
duty of fighting. Instead, he considers it easier to engage inahiàsä (non-violence) which is para-dharma (the duty of
others). Therefore, Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka  be-
ginning with the word çreyän . The word viguëa  means that,
although ones sva-dharma may have some defects and one
may be unable to execute it properly, it is still superior toperforming para-dharma , which may contain all good quali-
ties and be executed correctly ( sv-anuñöhität ). For this rea-
son, this sloka , çreyän sva-dharme , is spoken.
It is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  
(7.15.12) :
vidharmaù para-dharmaç ca / äbhäsa upamä cchalaù

The tree of adharma  has five branches vidharma  (activities
opposed to dharma ), para-dharma  (following anothers dharmika
principles), äbhäsa  (making a show of dharmika principles), upamä
or upa-dharma  (practising principles that only appear to be
dharmika ) and chala-dharma  (cheating dharma ). A knower of
dharma (dharma-jïa ) will abandon all of them as forbidden acts.35! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 226

Activities such as non-violence are prescribed for brähmaëas
situated in sattva-guëa . For kñatriyas  in rajo-guëa , the pre-
scribed duty is fighting. Therefore, the sva-dharma  for kñatriyas
is to engage in battle. Even if a kñatriya  dies in battle he at-
tains Svarga; therefore, it is better for him to fight.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, One who follows sva-
dharma may die before attaining a more elevated state of
dharma  (a higher adhikära ). Still it is auspicious, because
to perform para-dharma  is always fearful and dangerous in
any circumstance. This consideration, however, does notapply to nirguëa-bhakti . When the stage of nirguëa-bhakti
is attained, one can give up sva-dharma  without hesitation
because at that time his nitya-dharma  or svarüpa-dharma
(constitutional nature) manifests as his sva-dharma . Here
sva means the real self and dharma  means the jévas  eter-
nal function. In that stage the sva-dharma  which one pre-
viously accepted in relation to the body and mind becomespara-dharma , that is,  secondary to the duties of the awak-
ened self.

me. At present I have fallen into a pit of doubts. You have
just said that the ätmä  is completely distinct from inert
qualities or mundane relationships ( Gétä 2.13-31). Who, then,
impels the jévas to engage in sinful acts, if such action is not
their constitutional nature?

Çré Bhagavän said: This desire to enjoy sense objects, which in-
deed transforms into wrath, is born of passion. It is all-devouringand extremely formidable. Know it to be the primary enemy ofthe 
jévas in this world.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Käma , the desire for sense objects, invariably engages a
person in sinful actions; impelled by it, he acts sinfully. Käma
also appears differently and is seen directly as anger  (krodha ).
When the desire for sense objects  is obstructed, it transforms
into krodha . Käma , which is born from rajo-guëa , gives rise
to anger  which is in tamo-guëa . If one asks, Once a persons
expectations are fulfilled, will the desire for sense objectsbe satiated? then Çré Bhagavän responds by saying: mahä-
çanah , It is all-devouring. In småti it is said:
yat påthivyäà vréhi-yavaà / hiraëyaà paçavaù striyaù
nälam ekasya tat sarvam / iti matvä çamaà vrajet
All the grains, barley, gold, animals and women on earth can-
not satisfy the käma  of even one man. It is best to understand
this and become content.
According to the above statement of småti , it is beyond a
persons ability to satisfy his käma . Again, if the question is
raised, If there is no possibility of controlling this lust by
offering its desired ends as a truce, then do we have to control
it by pacifying it? then in response, Çré Bhagavän says, mahä-
päpmä. It is extremely formidable and difficult to control.

Käma  and krodha  have been described as the prime enemies
of the jévas on the path of liberation. Käma , the desire to enjoy
sense objects, is specifically the original enemy; krodha , anger,
is just its transformation. Käma  has been described as mahat ,
or an enemy whose belly is never filled. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam37! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 230
(9.19.14) this is seen in the life history of Yayäti Mahäräja:
na jätu kämaù kämänäm / upabhogena çäàyati
haviñä kåñëa-vartmeva / bhüya eväbhivardhate
By adding ghee to a fire, the fire becomes intensified. Similarly,
by the fulfillment of käma , ones desires are intensified. They do
not disappear.
yat påthivyäà vréhi-yavaà / hiraëyaà paçavaù striyaù
na duhyanti manaù-prétià / puàsaù käma-hatasya te
Çrémad-Bhägavatam 9.19.13
All the grains, gold, animals, and women on earth cannot sat-
isfy the käma of a lusty man.
An enemy is controlled by the four principles of säma (ap-
peasement), däma (bribe), bheda  (division) and daëòa  (pun-
ishment). Here Çré Bhagavän is explaining that this formidable
enemy, käma , cannot be controlled by the principles of säma ,
däma  and bheda . He is thus indicating that one should use the
principle of daëòa  (a rod of chastisement) to control the de-
sire for sense objects. This will be further clarified in the next
çloka . The enemy, käma , can be destroyed when one acquires
the weapon of ätma-jïäna , self-knowledge.

Just as fire is covered by smoke, a mirror by dust,
and an embryo by the womb, true knowledge of the
jéva remains covered by degrees of lust.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Käma  is the enemy of everyone, not just a particular person.
This is explained through these examples. Although fire maybe dirty and covered by smoke, it can still perform its functionof burning; but when a mirror is covered by dust, it loses thecharacteristic of cleanliness and cannot perform its functionof reflecting the image of the object in front of it. However, itis still accepted as a mirror. An embryo covered by the womb
cannot move its hands and feet nor can it be recognised as a
baby. One can remember the supreme goal only when käma
is not very deep. When käma  becomes intense, such remem-
brance is impossible and when it is very intense, the worlditself appears to be devoid of consciousness.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The knowledge of those jévas averse to self-realisation is
covered by three degrees of käma : mådu  (mild), madhya  (mod-
erate) and tévra (intense). A person whose jïäna  is covered by
mådu-käma  can accept instruction on ätma-tattva  to a certain
extent. When a persons jïäna  is covered by mädhya-käma , it
is completely impossible for him to understand even a littletattva-jïäna , and when jïäna  is covered by tévra-käma , jïäna
is not perceived at all.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, This
whole world is covered by that very käma , in some places
mildly, in some places deeply and in some places very deeply.
I will illustrate this with an example. Please listen. A con-
scious jéva who is mildly covered by käma , just as a fire is
covered by smoke, can perform activities such as bhägavat-
smaraëam.  This is the situation of jévas  who have taken38! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 232
shelter of niñkäma-karma -yoga and whose consciousness is
mukulita-cetana , a little open, as in the budding stage of a
flower. Even if the conscious jéva has a human body, when
his consciousness is deeply covered by käma , like a mirror
covered by dust, it is not possible for him to remember
Parameçvara. This is the condition of the extreme moralist
and atheist, that is, a jéva whose consciousness is saìkucita-
cetana , shrunken or contracted. They are like animals and
birds. A jéva whose consciousness is covered by intense käma ,
like the embryo covered by the womb, has a consciousness
like creepers, stones and trees and is äcchädita-cetana , com-
pletely covered.

Käma  is indeed ignorance for all jévas, as Çré Bhagavän is
explaining in this çloka  beginning with ävåtam . This desire to
enjoy the sense objects has been described as the eternal enemy;therefore, it must be destroyed by all means. Käma-rüpa means
in the form of käma. It is indeed ignorance which envelops the
real nature of the jéva. Here the word ca has been used to meanÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !233
like. Just as fire cannot be satiated by pouring ghee into it, simi-
larly, käma  cannot be fulfilled by enjoying the sense objects.
It is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (9.19.14):
na jätu kämaù kämänäm / upabhogena çäàyati
haviñä kåñëa-vartmeva / bhüya eväbhivardhate
Fire is not satiated by ghee, rather it increases. Similarly by
enjoying sense objects, the thirst for sense enjoyment increasesmore and more. It does not become pacified.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, This
käma  is indeed avidyä  for the jévas and it is their only eter-
nal enemy. It covers the conscious jévas like an irresistable
fire. Just as I, Çré Bhagavän, am a conscious being, similarlythe jéva is also a conscious entity. The difference between My
nature and that of the jéva is that I am infinitely con scious
and omnipotent, whereas the jéva is atomically conscious and
can only act by the energy given by Me. The nitya-dharma ,
eternal occupation, of the jéva is to be My eternal servant.
This is called prema  or niñkäma-jaiva-dharma , the eternal
function of the jéva whose motivation is unalloyed. Every
conscious being is, by his constitutional nature, endowedwith free will, thus he is My eternal servant by his own free
will. According to the degree to which he properly uses this
free will, he can act as My eternal servant. The misuse of that
pure free will is called avidyä  or käma . Those jévas who do not
serve Me by correctly using their free will have to accept käma ,
an enjoying mood, which is the perverted form of the jévas
pure state,  prema . Their svarüpa  becomes äcchädita-cetana
(covered consciousness) as they are covered more and more by
käma . This is called karma-bandhana , the bondage of the jéva,
or saàsära-yätanä , the sufferings of birth and death.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Where does this käma  reside? In response to this question,
Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka  beginning with indriyäëi .
The senses, mind and intelligence, which are like a great fort
or capital city, are the abode of this enemy, käma . The sense
objects, such as sound, are like the kingdom of the king. The
embodied soul, dehé, is bewildered by all of them.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
One can easily conquer ones enemy when one has discov-
ered his hiding-place and destroyed it. The senses are theshelter or hiding place of käma . Therefore, by subduing the
senses käma  can be easily defeated. Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa has
compared käma  to a very powerful king, the senses to his
capital which is protected by the great fort of the mind, in-
telligence and false ego, and the various sense objects to thekingdom and the subjects of the king.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, When the pure cognisant
jéva accepts a body, he is known as dehé (embodied). Käma
keeps the jïäna of the jéva covered as long as it dwells in the
senses, mind and intelligence. The subtle state of käma  is avidyä
(ignorance). It is this avidyä  only which originally offers the
initial veil of ignorance in the form of material ahaìkära
(false ego) to the jéva, who is an atomic conscious entity with
pure ego. Material intelligence acts as a shelter for this käma
or avidyä . Later, when the ahaìkära develops, the material
intelligence provides the mind as a second shelter. The mind,
which runs after sense objects, then provides the senses as thethird place of shelter for käma . Taking shelter of these three40 - 41! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  3 236
places, käma  casts the jéva into worldy enjoyment. When a
jéva turns towards Çré Bhagavän by his own will, it is called
vidyä , and when he wilfully becomes averse to Çré Bhagavän,
it is called avidyä .

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
By conquering the enemys place of shelter, the enemy is
conquered. This is the strategy. It is progressively more diffi-cult to control the senses, the mind and the intelligence,which are the seats of käma (the desire to enjoy). It is very
difficult to control the senses, but they are easier to controlthan the mind and intelligence. Therefore, first conquer yoursenses. Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the
word tasmät just to explain this point. Although the mind,
which is very difficult to control, runs after enjoying anotherswife and wealth, you should understand what is happening;this is only the work of the senses, such as the eyes, ears, handsand legs. One should control these senses by not allowing themÇLOKA KARMA -YOGA !237
to pursue their respective objects. Päpmänam  means to give
up this ferocious desire to enjoy. In this way, if a persongradually controls his senses, his mind will also become free
from käma  in due course of time.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Assisted by the senses, this powerful käma  uses the ropes
of delusion to bind jévas who are averse to Çré Bhagavän.
Therefore, it is imperative from the outset to control the
senses such as the eyes. When the external senses are thus
controlled, the mind, whose function is saìkalpa  (the deter-
mination to accept) and vikalpa  (the choice to reject), will
also be controlled.
Çré Bhagavän also spoke thus to Uddhava:
viñayendriya-saàyogän / manaù kñubhyati nänyathä
Çrémad-Bhägavatam 11.26.22
The mind becomes restless only when the senses come in con-
tact with the sense objects, otherwise not.
asamprayuïjataù präëän / çämyati stimitaà manaù
Çrémad Bhägavatam  11.26.23
Therefore, the mind of a person who has control over his senses
becomes stable and peaceful.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Therefore, best of the Bharatas, by first controlling the sensesand mind, conquer this extremely formidable käma  which
destroys jïäna  and vijïäna , devotion to Me. Destroying its
distorted nature (lust), reinstate its own constitutional nature,prema. Thus take shelter of the inherent nature of prema .
The first commendable duty of a baddha-jéva  is to follow the

pursue sva-dharma , prescribed duties. Thus, by gradually at-

The senses are more powerful than a courageous warriorwho has conquered the ten directions. Indeed, they are su-perior to him, for even he cannot have control over his senses.The mind is more power ful than the senses, and superior to
them, for it remains active even during dreams when the senses

resolute intelligence remains active even during deep sleep,
when the mind is dissolved. Over and above this, the ätma is
more powerful than the intelligence and superior to it, for it
continues to exist even when the intelligence is destroyed. It
is this glorious soul alone that can conquer käma . This
jévätmä , which is more powerful than everything else, can
definitely control käma , once it has controlled the senses,
mind and intelligence. Of this you should have no doubt.

Certainly, reason is superior to the senses, and mind is higher
than reason. Higher than the mind is intelligence, and the great
one, the ätmä  (soul) is highest of all.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, I am
explaining the gradation to you in brief. Your real identity is
that you are a jéva. You have a constitutional function of
rendering loving service to Me, but you have accidentally
become bound by inert matter, so that you now identify your-

and it is created by ignorance. The senses are superior to andmore subtle than inert objects. Superior and more subtle

In the Fourth Chapter, Çré Bhagavän explains the rea-

An incarnation of Manu appears in every manvantara , the
first being Sväyambhuva Manu. In the current Vaivasvata-
manvantara, it was Manus father, Vivasvän, who was the first
to receive instructions on jïäna-yoga . In this çloka , Çré
Bhagavän has introduced the concept of sämpradäyika-dhärä ,
the bona fide succession of self-realised spiritual masters.
Without sämpradäyika-dhärä , also known as ämnäya-
paramparä , neither the principles of jïäna-tattva nor bhakti-
tattva can manifest in their pure form in the material world.
Only by sämpradäyika-dhärä  is the gravity, antiquity and sig-
nificance of the subject specifically proven. It is seen that in
India, even the common people have faith in the ancient
sämpradäyika-dhärä , and are devoted to it. That guru-param-
parä, which bestows complete knowledge of bhagavat-tattva ,
is called ämnäya  or sampradäya . Mantras  that are not received
from a bona fide sampradäya  are fruitless. In Kali-yuga there
are four Vaiñëava  sampradäyas : Çré, Brahmä, Rudra and Sanaka
or Kumära sampradäyas . Çré Kåñëa is the original source of all
sampradäyas . Only from Çré Kåñëa does knowledge of
bhagavat-tattva  flow into this material world: dharmaà tu
säkñäd bhägavat-praëétam.  Real dharma  comes directly from
Çré Bhagavän  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam 6.3.19 ).
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä , Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa first
instructed this jïäna-yoga  to Sürya-deva, Vivasvän, who
then instructed Manu, who in turn gave these divineÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !245 2
instructions to Ikñväku. Thus the system of guru-paramparä
is an ancient and reliable tradition that ensures the
sämpradäyika-dhärä (lineage) in which divya-jïäna (divine
knowledge) has been preserved up to the present day. When-ever this dhärä  is broken, Çré Bhagavän again arranges for divya-
jïäna  to manifest in the material world. Mahä-bhägavatas  such
as Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Çréla BaladevaVidyäbhüñaëa and others in the guru-paramparä of the
Brahma-Mädhva Gauòéya sampradäya  realised divya-jïäna
and instructed the common people through their realised com-
mentaries. Even a person who is highly qualified in materialknowledge can never understand the real import of Bhagavad-
gétä unless he is properly situated in the paramparä .
It is important to protect oneself from self-made commenta-
tors, otherwise, realisation of the true meaning of the Bhagavad-
gétä will not be possible. Although milk is pure and nourishing,
when it has been touched by the lips of a serpent, it acts likepoison. Similarly, topics of Çré Hari are supremely purifying forthe material world, but hearing such topics becomes the causeof ones destruction when they are recited by non-devotees suchas impersonalists, or those who consider the body to be the self.
In this connection, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has also said:
mäyävädé-bhäñya çunile haya sarva-näça.  If one hears the com-
mentary of the  impersonalists,  everything is destroyed  (Çré
Caitanya-caritämåta Madhya-lélä 6.169).

Arjuna is Bhagaväns great bhakta  and eternal friend
(nitya -sakha ). For this reason, he is also referred to as a
parikara of Çré Kåñëa, and as such he knows bhagavat-tattva
completely. Ignorant people generally think that Bhagavän
Väsudeva, the controller of all controllers, is an ordinary
human being. Instead of accepting that He is omniscient and
ever-existing, they consider Him to be a man of limited knowl-
edge who is subject to death. They also think that the birth
and activities of Bhagavän are temporary, not knowing thatthey are transcendental.
It is said in Bhagavad-gétä  (10.12):
paraà brahma paraà dhäma / pavitraà paramaà bhavän
puruñaà çäçvataà divyam / ädi-devam ajaà vibhum
Contrary to the meaning of this çloka , ignorant persons do
not accept that Çré Bhagavän is the Supreme Absolute Truth
(paraà brahma ), possessed of a spiritual form ( paraà dhäma ),
and supremely pure ( paraà pavitra ). They also do not believe
that He is an eternal person ( çäçvata-puruña ), and the original
God ( ädi-deva ), who is unborn ( aja) and all-pervading  (sarva-
vyäpaka ), and who is endowed with transcendental opulence
(divya-aiçvarya ). Although Arjuna is highly learned, for the
welfare of humanity, he is inquiring from Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa
as if he were an ignorant person, so that Bhagavän may deliverthese tattvas  from His own lotus mouth.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän is explaining the principle behind His birth
(janma-tattva ). Although I am unborn, I manifest in vari-
ous species such as the devas , humans and animals. One may
ask, What is so wonderful about this? In reality, the jéva is
also unborn, and when his gross body is destroyed, he alsoaccepts another birth. In response, Çré Bhagavän says,avyayätmä.  My body is imperishable, whereas the body of theÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !251
jéva is perishable. Moreover, the unborn nature of the jéva is
of a different type. His birth is due to his identifying withthe body which has arisen out of ignorance. As Éçvara, I am
non-different from My body. Consequently, My quality of
being both born and unborn is perfectly natural. Such a
nature, which is impossible to find elsewhere, is wonderful
and beyond the scope of logic and reason. Thus there is no
possibility of comparing My birth to that of the jéva, who
takes birth in high and low species as a result of his pietyand sin. To clarify this further, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa says,
Even though I am the Éçvara of the jévas, which means that
I am free from the control of karma , still I accept birth.
The following doubt may be raised: The jéva also takes
bodies in various species such as devas , humans and animals,
due to the activities of his subtle body ( liìga-çaréra ) which
cause his bondage. You, Parameçvara, do not have a subtle
body. You are all-pervading and the controller of all prin-
ciples, including käla (time) and karma  (action). It is said in
the çrutis  that You desired to become many, bahu syäm , I can
become many. According to this statement of çruti, You are
everything in the entire universe. However, You specifically
express in the çrutis : evaà bhuto py ahaà sambhavämi.  Al-
though I appear to be everything in the universe, still I per-
sonally manifest Myself. From this it is understood that You
take birth only to manifest Your eternal form, which is cat-
egorically distinct from the whole universe.
This being the case, one may inquire, What is the nature
of these bodies of Yours? In response to this, Çré Bhagavän
says in the second half of this çloka : prakåtià sväm adhiñöhäya
sambhämy ätma-mäyayä.  If the word prakåti  is taken to in-
dicate the external mäyä-çakti , the meaning here becomes
Parameçvara, the presiding controller of prakåti , who becomes
the universe with the help of this çakti. However, this does not
describe the specific nature of Çré Bhagavän. In the Sanskrit6! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 252
dictionary it is said: saà-siddhi-prakåtis tv ime svarüpaï ca
sva bhävaç ca . Svarüpa  (natural form) and svabhäva  (intrin-
sic nature) are synonyms for saàsiddhi  or prakåti . For this
reason, the word prakåti  mentioned in this çloka indicates
svarüpa. The nature of this svarüpa  is sac-cid-änanda .
Çréla Çrédhara Svämépäda says, Your svarüpa  is not com-
posed of mäyä-çakti , but is sac-cid-änanda . Therefore, Your
prakåti  is by nature çuddha-sattva , pure goodness.
According to Çré Rämänujäcärya, prakåti  means svabhäva .
Remaining situated in Your svabhäva , that is, retaining Your
entire divinity, You manifest Your own svarüpa  only by Your
independent will. If we accept prakåti  as svabhäva , then the
use of these qualifying adjectives, that is, sac-cid-änanda-
ghana eka-rasa  (uniformly concentrated eternity, knowledge
and bliss), distinguishes between Çré Bhagaväns form andmäyä . Sväm  means ones own rüpa . It is said in the çruti:  sa
bhagavataù kasmin pratiñöhitaù sva-mahimni. Çré Bhagavän
is situated in full possession of all His divine glory. Accord-
ing to Çré Madhusüdana Sarasvaté, when Bhagavän appears,He still remains situated in His svarüpa . He behaves like an
embodied living entity, although there is no difference be-tween His body and His actual self.
If one raises the question, Since You are eternal, when You
accept indestructible forms such as Matsya and Kürma, areYour past and present forms also simultaneously percep-tible? then in response Bhaga vän says: ätma-mäyayä.  This
act is performed by My ätma-bhütä  mäyä  (internal potency
or yogamäyä ). My svarüpa  is both concealed and manifested
by yogamäyä , which is the function of cit-çakti . I appear only
with the help of this yogamäyä , who is manifesting My present
svarüpa  and who has concealed My previous forms.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé writes in his commentary, I appear
only by My ätma-mäyä , the potency of complete and infal-
lible knowledge, strength, prowess, and so on.ÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !253
Çré Rämänujäcärya writes in his commentary, Çré
Bhagavän appears by His ätma-mäyä , or through the potency
of His own knowledge. Ätma-jïäna -mäyä vayünam jïänam.
In this context the word mäyä  is a synonym for jïäna . This
is also confirmed by the Sanskrit dictionary. Çré Bhagavänknows the pious and impious karma  of the eternal jévas only
by the help of this potency.
According to Madhusüdana Sarasvaté, It is simply illusion
to apply the conception of the body and the embodied to Me,Bhagavän Väsudeva, for I am transcendental to all suchduality.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the Kürma Puräëa  it is stated: deha-dehé-vibhägaç ca
neçvare vidyate kvacit.  In regard to Çré Bhagavän, there is
no distinction between the body and the embodied.
Regarding the jéva, however, the body is different from the
embodied soul, meaning that his gross and subtle bodies aredifferent from him, the jévätmä . This is further clarified in
Çré Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya lélä  17.132):
deha-dehér , näma-nämér kåñëe nähi bheda
jévera dharmanäma-deha-svarüpe vibheda
In Kåñëa there is no distinction between näma  and nämé  (the
name and the possessor of the name), or between deha  and dehé
(the body and the embodied). The embodied jévas dharma  (char-
acter or nature), name and body, however, are different from his
svarüpa  (spiritual constitution).
Bhagavän is aja, unborn. By His own will He accepts the
shelter of His cit-çakti in the form of yogamäyä , and by
manifesting His eternal body in this material world, He per-forms simple and natural pastimes as though He is an ordi-nary boy. Still, His body, consisting of sac-cid-änanda , is not
covered by a gross or subtle body. The atomic jéva, on the6! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 254
other hand, being overpowered by the influence of
Bhagaväns mäyä-çakti , accepts a subtle and a gross body
according to his saàskäras , impressions created by his previ-
ous karma , and in this way again takes birth.
In conclusion, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has commented
that here Kåñëa is explaining to Arjuna, Although you and
I appear in this world again and again, there is a specific
difference between your descent and mine. I am Éçvara, the
controller of all jévas; I am aja, without birth, and My form
is immutable. I appear through the agency of My cit-çakti ,
whereas the jévas take birth in this world under the influence
of My mäyä-çakti , which deprives them of the memory of
their past lives. Jévas  have to accept a subtle body as a result
of their previous karma , and as a result of taking shelter of
that subtle body, they have to repeatedly take birth. My
appearance, however, in the deva, animal and other forms,
occurs solely by My own will. Unlike the jévas, My supremely
pure conscious body is not covered by a subtle and a gross
body. In this mundane plane I manifest that very same eter-nal body which exists naturally in Vaikuëöha.
Someone may inquire, How is it possible for cit-tattva , the
transcendental Personality, to manifest in the material world
along with His realm? Now hear My response. My yogamäyä-
çakti  is inconceivable, and consequently cannot be compre-
hended. No amount of reasoning, howe ver clever, is able to
comprehend and measure the acts performed by yogamäyä.
You must understand, by naturally acquired knowledge that
I, Bhagavän, with My inconceivable potency, am not bound
by any rules governing the mundane plane. By My mere
will, all the entities of Vaikuëöha can easily manifest their
supremely pure forms in this material world. In other words,
I can transform the complete phenomenal manifestation
into cit-svarüpa . My sac-cid-änanda  vigraha , which is beyond
all material laws, is indeed completely pure, even when itÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !255
manifests in the material world. What doubt can there be of
this? That mäyä , which controls the jéva, is also My prakåti ,
energy, but understand that when I use the phrase Myprakåti , it only refers to the cit-çakti . Although My potency
is one without a second, in My presense it is cit-çakti , how-
ever, for the jévas bound by karma , it is mäyä-çakti , endowed
with its respective influences and various types of majestic,mystic powers, which forces them to rotate in the cycle ofbirth and death.

When does Çré Bhagavän appear? To answer this question,
Bhagavän replies with this çloka  beginning with the word yadä.
Being unable to tolerate the decline of dharma  and the in-
crease of adharma , I appear for the purpose of changing or re-
versing the situation.
According to Çrépäda Madhusüdana Sarasvaté, ätmänaà

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In each birth, a jéva who is bound by the result of his karma
takes a new body that is made from inert matter. But ÇréBhagavän, by His own will and through the agency of Hismäyä-çakti , deludes the asuras  in such a way that they con-
sider His body to be an object of the material creation. ÇréÇukadeva Gosvämé has confirmed this in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(
9.24.56 ):
yadä yadä hi dharmasya kñayo våddhiç ca päpmanaù
tadä tu bhagavän éça ätmänaà såjate hariù
Whenever there is a decline of dharma and an increase of sin,
Bhagavän Çré Hari manifests Himself in this world.
Various äcäryas  have explained the word dharma used in  this
çloka in different ways. Çré Rämänujäcärya has accepted the
word dharma  to mean the worship of Bhagavän. Çré Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa has explained dharma as çuddha-bhakti-yoga ,
characterised by the performance of arcana (worship) of
Bhagavän, dhyäna  (meditation) and other such practices as well
as varëäçrama-dharma  prescribed in the Vedas .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has quoted Kåñëa as follows:
The only reason for My appearance is that I desire it; I de-scend of My own free will. Whenever there is a decline in
dharma and a prevalence of adharma , I appear of My own
accord. My laws, which govern the activities of this materialworld, are unconquerable. However, when in due course oftime, these rules become ineffective for some undefinable andindescribable reason, adharma  becomes prominent. No one
except Me can put an end to this disorder. I thus appear inthis mundane plane with the assistance of My cit-çakti  and
dispel the decline of dharma .ÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !257
It is not true that I only appear in the land of Bhärata, India.
According to necessity I appear, by My will, among devas ,
animals, birds and all other species. Therefore, do not think
that I do not appear among mleccha , antyaja and other out-
castes. All those pitiable people also except a certain degree of
dharma as their sva-dharma  (natural religion). When their
religion declines, I also appear among them as a çaktyäveça-
avatära and protect their religion. In India people regularly
perform their sva-dharma  in the form of varëäçrama-dharma.
Because of this, I make a special endevour to establish this
system of dharma  among them. For this reason, all the charm-
ing avatäras , such as the yuga-avätaras  and the aàça-avatäras
(partial avatäras ) can be seen to manifest only in India. In
places where there is no varëäçrama-dharma , people cannot
properly practise niñkäma-karma -yoga , or its goals, jïäna -
yoga , and its highest fruit, bhakti-yoga . Still, any tinge of
bhakti  which manifests among the outcastes  (antyaja ), can
be attributed to the sudden devotional faith generated by the
mercy of My bhakta .

Çré Bhagavän establishes varëäçrama-dharma  by transmit-
ting çakti  into the hearts of His prominent saintly bhaktas
in the royal and brähmiëical  orders. However, Bhagavän
Himself descends for three reasons: to pacify the afflictionsof those bhaktas  who are suffering in separation from Him,
to kill asuras  like Kaàsa who strongly oppose the sädhus  andÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !259
who cannot be killed by others, and to propagate  the message
of çuddha-bhakti .
While defining the word avatära , Çréla Jéva Gosvämépäda
writes: avatäraç ca präkåta-vaibhave vataraëam iti. The de-
scent of Çré Bhagavän into this material creation is calledavatära .
Çré Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa has elucidated on the same
point in different words: aprapaïcät prapaïce vataraëaà khalv
avatäraù. The descent of Bhagavän from His unmanifested
eternal abode into the mundane plane is called avatära .
Çré Kåñëa is avatäré , the origin of unlimited avatäras . He is
therefore called Svayaà Bhagavän. His avatäras  are of six
types: (1) puruña-avatära , (2) guëa-avatära , (3) lélä-avatära ,
(4) manvantara-avatära , (5) yuga-avatära  and (6) çaktyäveça-
avatära .
There are four yugas : Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali. In
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.5.20), it is stated that Kåñëa appears
in all of them:
kåtaà tretä dväparaà ca kalir ity eñu keçavaù
nänä-varëäbhidhäkäro nänaiva vidhinejyate
One day of Brahmäs life span is called a kalpa . There are
fourteen manvantaras  in one kalpa . There are one thousand
catur-yugas  (complete cycles of the four ages) in one day of
Brahmä. According to the calculations of human solar years,one day of Brahmä equals 4,320,000,000 years. Three hundredand sixty such days make one year of Brahmä, and Brahmälives for one hundred such years.
Although Bhagavän kills the wicked asuras , He remains aloof
from their faults. In other words, He is free from the imperfectionof being biased; His killing them is only an exhibition of Hismercy towards them. Commenting on the çloka: ajasya
janmotpatha-näçanäya  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  3.1.44), Ç réla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura writes, Although Bhagavän8! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 260
is aja (unborn), He descends to annihilate and liberate the
asuras who impede the path of truth.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has also commented in a similar
manner:
lälane täòane mätur näkäruëya yathärbhake
tadvad eva maheçasya niyantur guëa-doñayoù
Just as an affectionate mother is not considered hard-hearted or
harsh if she chastises her child in the course of raising and caringfor him, Parameçvara is also not cruel when He disciplines thejévas to bring out their good qualities and diminish their bad ones.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has quoted Çré Kåñëa as fol-
lows: I establish varëäçrama-dharma  by infusing My çakti
into the royal and brähmiëical saints who are devoted to Me.
However, in order to protect My pure  bhaktas from non-devo-
tees, there is a need for Me to appear. Thus, appearing as theyuga-avatäras , I protect the sädhus . By eliminating the wicked
asuras , I redress the decline in dharma , and by preaching the
limbs of bhakti , such as çravaëa  and kértana , I establish the
eternal dharma  of the jévas.
I descend in every yuga . From this statement, one should
understand that I also descend in Kali-yuga. My avatära  in
Kali-yuga,  Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, will establish that most
rarely attained prema , the eternal dharma , solely by the pro-
cess of näma-saìkértana . This avatära  has no other purpose,
and as the greatest of all avatäras I will remain concealed
from the common man. My pure bhaktas  will be naturally at-
tracted to Me,  and you, Arjuna, will realise this when you
appear with Me in that age. The most wonderful feature ofthis hidden avatära , who delivers the people of Kali-yuga, is
that I reform the miscreants wicked natures by blessing themwith divine love through the chanting of näma-saìkértana ,
instead of completely annihilating them in the manner ofMy previous avatäras .ÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !261

One will only become perfect when he has understood the
essence of the transcendental nature of My birth ( janma )
and activities ( karma ), which are endowed with the charac-
teristics described in the previous çlokas . This çloka , begin-
ning with the word janma , is spoken to explain this. Çrépäda
Rämänujäcärya and Çrépäda Madhusüdana Sarasvaté ex-
plain that the word divya  means apräkåta , transcendental,
and Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has translated it as alaukika , not
of this material world. The material world is created by
prakåti  (material nature), thus by the word alaukika  Çréla
Çrédhara Svämépäda also implies apräkåta . Consequently,
because the birth and activities of Çré Bhagavän are apräkåta
and beyond the modes, they are nitya  (eternal).
In the Bhagavat-sandarbha , Çréla Jéva Gosvämé refers to
this present subject in his explanation of the çloka:  na vidyate
yasya ca janma karma vä  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (8.3.8)). He9! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 262
explains that, although this matter cannot be comprehended
by logic, on the strength of statements from the Vedas andSmåti it must be accepted as being beyond reason.
In this regard, it is also said in the Puruña-bodhiné çruti  of
Pipläda-çäkhä:
eko deva nitya-lélänurakto / bhakta-hådy antar-ätmä
Eternally engaged in His pastimes, the one Lord in His form of
Antaryämé enters within the hearts of His bhaktas .
Regarding the eternality of Çré Bhagaväns birth and activi-
ties ( janma  and karma ), detailed descriptions have been given
in Çrémad-Bhägavatam.
After hearing My statements such as: yo vetti tattvataù  (Gétä
4.9), ajo pi sann avyayätmä  (Gétä  4.6) and janma karma ca
me divyam  (Gétä  4.9), one who understands the eternal na-
ture of My birth  and activities  with theistic intelligence-that
is, who is not dependent on empiricism to accept it-does nothave to take birth again in this material world.
Those who in truth  understand the word tat in the state-
ment of Gétä (
17.23 )-oà tat sad iti nirdeço brahmaëas tri-
vidhaù småtaù  to mean brahma  do not have to take birth again
after giving up their present body. Rather, it is assured thatthey attain Me. Here Bhagavän gives a superior meaning tothe phrase giving up the body. Such a person does not takeanother birth after giving up the body. Rather, he attains Meeven without giving it up.
Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya writes paraphrasing Kåñëa, All
sins that impede one on the path to attain My full shelterare completely destroyed by true knowledge of My transcen-dental birth and activities. Only those dear devotees who havetaken shelter of Me, attain Me even in this very life.ÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !263
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Those who, by the grace of guru  and the Vaiñëavas, real-
ise that Çré Bhagavän accepts a transcendental birth and per-
forms transcendental activities through the medium of His
acintya-çakti  attain eternal service to Him in this very life
by the mercy of His hlädhiné-çakti . On the contrary, those
who consider the birth  and activities of Çré Kåñëa to be
mundane are overpowered by ignorance and wander in thecycle of birth and death, afflicted by the three-fold miseries.
Lord Brahmä has also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.7.29):
tat karma divyam iva , The activities of Çré Bhagavän are
indeed suprahuman. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkurahas clarified this point in his Bhägavatam commentary on
this çloka.  In reality, all of Çré Kåñëas activities are tran-
scendental. Furthermore, it is stated:
na vidyate yasya ca janma karma vä
na näma-rüpe guëa-doña eva vä
tathäpi lokäpyaya-sambhaväya yaù
sva-mäyayä täny anukälam åcchati
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (8.3.8)
For the Lord there is no janma , karma , näma , rüpa , guëa , doña
(fault), etc., yet He always accepts these attributes by His po-tency for the creation and destruction of the material world.
The explanation of the above çloka  by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé
is significant and can be referred to in his Bhägavat-
sandarbha  and Krama-sandarbha.
The Çrutis have described Bhagavän as niñphala  (ineffec-
tive), niñkriya  (inactive), niraïjana  (faultless), niräkära  (form-
less), açabdam  (indescribable), avyaya  (imperishable), and so
forth. This is only because He is beyond material qualities.Thus, in specific Çrutis such as Chändogya Upaniñad  (3.14.4),
He is called sarva-karmäù , the performer of all activities,9! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 264
sarva-kämaù , the possessor of all types of desires, sarva-
gandhaù , the possessor of all fragrances, sarva-rasaù , the
possessor of all mellows, and so on. This is corroborated in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  6.4.33:
yo nugrahärthaà bhajatäà päda-mülam
anäma-rüpo bhagavän anantaù
nämäni rüpäëi ca janma-karmabhirbheje sa mahyaà paramaù prasédatu
To bestow mercy upon those who worship His lotus feet,
Bhagavän-although free from material names, forms and otherattributes-accepts various transcendental forms and namesthrough His different avatäras  and activities. May that unlimited
Bhagavän, whose opulence is inconceivable, be pleased with me.
Those who are bhaktas  achieve Bhagavän even while living
within this body. Kåñëa says: yänti mäm eva nirguëäù. Those
who are free from the modes attain Me ( Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  11.25.22 ). While commenting on this çloka , Çréla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura writes that the word laya
(dissolution) is not mentioned here. This clarifies Kåñëaspoint: Upon becoming nirguëa , My bhaktas  attain Me even
in their present body.

Çré Bhagavän says, O Arjuna, not only do those having
full knowledge of My birth and activities, who are nowpresent during My current avatära attain Me, but even in
ancient times those endowed with this transcendental knowl-
edge of My birth and activities of My previous avatäras  also
attained Me. To explain this, the present çloka , beginning
with the word véta-räga , is being spoken. Jïäna-tapasä  means
purified by austerity in the form of knowledge . In the opinion
of Çré Rämä nujäcärya, Kåñëa is saying, This knowledge is
realisation of the absolute knowledge of My birth and ac-tivities. People attain Me when they have been purified byrealizing My birth and activities in terms of the characteris-tics described earlier. In other words, While trying withdetermination to realise the eternal nature of My birth andactivities, they attain My prema-bhakti. However, they are
first purified by the fire of transcendental knowledge and the
austerity of tolerating the burning poison of the serpents ofvarious types of wrong opinions, misguided logic and falla-cious arguments.
In Çré Rämänujäcäryas commentary he cites the Çruti
statement: tasya dhéräù parijänanti yonim.  One who is dhéra
(intelligent) completely knows the nature of Çré Bhagaväns
birth.

gus opinions. My bhaktas  do not become angry with them
nor do they fear them. If one asks why, the answer is thatthey are intensely absorbed in deliberating and meditating
on My birth and activities, and hearing and chanting aboutthem. Mad-bhävam  means  prema  for Me.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
There are three reasons why foolish people are not inclined
to deliberate on the transcendental and supremely pure
nature of My birth,  activities and form. They are: (1) at-
tachment to worldly objects, (2) fear and (3) anger. Those
whose intelligence is tightly bound by mundane thoughts are
so deeply absorbed in and attached to materialism, that they
do not accept or even consider the existence of an eternal
entity known as cit-tattva . According to such persons,
svabhäva  (nature itself) is the Absolute Truth . Some of them
maintain that inert matter is the eternal cause and the source
of cit-tattva . The jaòa-vädés  (empiricists), the svabhäva-vädés
(nature theorists), and the caitanya-héna-vidhi-vädés,  who
advocate a system of ethics which is based on the conception
that the Absolute is unconscious, have no understanding of
consciousness. These three classes of philosophers are all
impelled by an attachment to materialism and contend that
inert matter is the all-in-all ( jaòa-vädés ), that nature is a law
unto itself ( svabhäva-vädés ) and that one can deny the prin-
ciple of consciousness ( caitanya-héna-vidhi-vädés ). They
gradually become bereft of any transcendental attachment
to the Supreme Absolute Reality.
Although some thinkers do accept cit-tattva  (spiritual
principles) as eternal, because they reject the principles of
transcendental knowledge and perpetually take shelter of
mundane logic and reasoning, they can actually have noÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !267
realisa tion of cit-tattva . Whatever attributes and activities
they see in inert matter they designate as asat (unreal) and
very carefully abandon them. Thus, in the name of identi-
fying that which is uncontaminated by inert matter, they
imagine an Absolute Reality ( brahma ) which is beyond
definition. However, that is nothing more than an indirect
manifestation of My mäyä ; it is not My eternal form. Later
they give up meditating on My svarüpa  and worshipping
My deity form, fearing that by this meditation and way of
thinking they may come under the influence of materialconceptions. Because of this fear, they lose the opportunityto realise the svarüpa  of the Absolute Truth ( parama-tattva )
and are deprived of My prema . There are others who, be-
ing unable to discern any substance beyond matter, becomepossessed by anger. Impelled by such anger they maintainthat the Absolute Reality is just nirväëa , a void, nothing-
ness and the complete annihilation of all existence. Thedoctrine of the Buddhists and Jains has appeared from thisprinciple of nirväëa .
Many wise men, however, do become free from attach-
ment, fear and anger and see nothing but Myself every-where. Genuinely surrendered to Me, they are purified bythe fire of transcendental knowledge, and by the penanceof tolerating the burning poison of false reasoning. Thusthey have attained pure, sublime love for Me.

Others, who have an inclination toward jïäna and other pro-
cesses, take shelter of You to perfect their particular process,
but they do not accept the eternality of Your birth and ac-
tivities. What will happen to them? In response, Çré Kåñëa
speaks this çloka  beginning with the words ye yathä . Those
who take shelter of Me perform bhajana , and I reciprocate
by granting them the result of that bhajana . I am the supreme
master, and My birth and activities (pastimes) are eternal.
To those with this understanding, who also perform My

are others, such as the jïänés , who take shelter of Me, con-

form to be a product of the external energy. In turn, I repeat-

It is understood from this çloka  that according to the inten-
tion with wh ich people worship or take shelter of Bhagavän
Çré Hari, He rewards them in accordance with their desires.
The çuddha-bhaktas  worship Him to attain eternal service
to His sac-cid-änanda deity. Making such prema-bhaktas  His
nitya-parikaras , Bhagavän Çré Hari fulfils their desire to attain
His loving service ( prema-mayé sevä ). In accordance with the
desire of the nirviçeña-vädé  jïänés , Bhagavän grants them
mukti in the form of nirväëa  in the featureless nirviçeña-
brahma , which is the unvariegated manifestation of His per-
sonality. Bhagavän appears to sakäma-karmés  as the bestower
of the fruits of their karma.  He appears to the yogés  as Éçvara,
giving them vibhüti  (mystic powers) or kaivalya  (liberation).
However, of all the various achievements, attaining the ser-
vice of Vrajendra-nandana Çré Kåñëa in Goloka Vraja is the
ultimate.
It should be clearly understood from the present çloka  of11! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 270
Bhagavad-gétä  that the results of different types of bhajana
depend on the desires of the practitioners. The results of
various types of worship are not the same.  Some explain the
words manuñyäù pärtha sarvaçaù  to mean that everyone is
following the path of service to Bhagavän and, whatever
action they may perform, they will all attain the same re-
sult. This conception is completely incorrect. The idea that
the miscreants, the jïänés , the bhaktas  and the prema-bhaktas
ultimately achieve the exact same destination has been refuted
in çästras  such as Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam . This
is stated later in the Gétä  (9.25):
yänti deva-vratä devän / pitèn yänti pitå-vratäù

Those who worship the devas  go to the planets of the devas , those
who worship the forefathers go to their planet, those who wor-ship the spirits go to the planet of the spirits and those who
worship Me attain Me.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as follows,
When people accept My shelter by worshipping Me, I re-
ciprocate with whatever intention or faith they have in rela-

tureless aspect ( nirviçeña-vädés ), I award nirväëa-mukti , to-
tal absorption in the nirviçeña-brahma , by way of self-anni-
hilation. Since they do not accept the eternality of My sac-

In this way, as sarva-svarüpa , the intrinsic form of everything,

Karma  is of three types: nitya , routine; naimittika , occasional
and kämya , with fruitive desire. Actions prescribed in the
Vedas,  such as sandhya , reciting prayers at the three junctions
of the day,  are nitya-karma , daily religious duties. Activities
such as pitå-çräddha , offering oblations to the forefathers, are
known as naimittika-karma or occasional duties and those
actions performed with a fruitive desire are called kämya-
karma  or sakäma . Kämya-karma  is superior to both akarma ,
abstaining from prescribed duties and vikarma , prohibited,
sinful action.

One may ask, The paths of bhakti  and jïäna  give mukti
as their fruit, yet the path of karma  gives bondage. You,
Parameçvara, have introduced all these paths, so how is it that
this biased feature exists in You? In response, Çré Bhagavän
says, No, no, it is not like this. To justify this, He has spo-
ken this çloka  beginning with the word cätur-varëyam , which
indicates the four varëas.
The qualities of four varëas  are as follows: brähmaëas pos-
sess a predominance of sattva-guëa , and their activity ( karma )
is to control the mind and senses. Kñatriyas  are predominated
by sattva-guëa  mixed with rajas , and their karma is to be
chivalrous and to engage in warfare. Vaiçyas  are predominated
by rajo-guëa  mixed with tamas , and their karma  is farming13! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 274

guëa , and their karma  is to perform menial service.
I have created the four varëas , guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù ,
according to divisions based on guëa (quality)  and karma
(work) which is supported by karma -märga (the path of
fruitive work). Although I am the doer and the creator of
this system, you should know that I am not the doer or the
creator, for I am not directly concerned with this system.
Material nature ( prakåti ) is My potency, but I am transcen-
dental to the modes of material nature . Hence, although I
am the creator, I am also not the creator, because I am free
from the false ego of being the doer. It is My prakåti  which,
as the material cause, is the direct agent concerned with es-tablishing this system. I am therefore immutable. In otherwords, I remain unchanged, unbound and unconcerned withthe introduction of the varëa  system.

Çré Bhagavän alone is the creator and direct initiator
(karttä ) of the whole universe. According to this siddhänta ,
He alone is the creator( karttä ) of varna and the fourfold sys-
tem of varëa-dharma . By His constitutional nature, the jéva
is nitya-kåñëa-däsa . Bhagavän has bestowed upon him an in-
valuable treasure in the form of free will. When the jéva
misuses his independence by deciding not to serve Kåñëa,Bhagaväns mäyä  immediately covers his svarüpa  with gross
and subtle bodies, and throws him into the cycle of saàsära.
To deliver such jévas, Çré Bhagavän, being causelessly merci-
ful, creates the path of karma-märga  (varëäçrama-dharma )
through the agency of His mäyä-çakti . At the same time, He
is eternally engaged in enjoying with His cit-çakti , and so
remains avyaya  (unchangeable) and akarttä (the non-doer).
For further details about the four varëas , one should read

Çré Bhagavän is pürëa-tattva  (the complete Absolute Real-

Bhagavän is bereft of oppulence. Bhagavän is the master of
mäyä , while the jéva is subject to mäyäs  control. These are
the differences between the two. The jéva can never, under
any circumstance, b ecome brahma  or Bhagavän. However,
when the jéva performs bhagavad-bhakti , knowing that Çré
Bhagavän is all-powerful, independent, imperishable and
desireless, he beco mes freed from the bondage of karma , and
attains the service of Bhagavän in his svarüpa.  This is the
jévas  eternal position ( nitya-dharma ).
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, The
path of karma  which is created due to adåñöa  (the jévas previous
abuse of free will)  does not affect Me. Nor do I desire to enjoy
the petty fruits of karma  because I, Bhagavän, am full in six
opulences. Those who keep in mind My absolute free natureby understanding My avyaya-tattva (imperishable nature) and
by deliberating on the path of karma (varëäçrama system),
are, like Me, never bound by karma . By performing çuddha-

Vikarma , forbidden action, leads to a miserable destination.
This is the principle. Akarma means not to  perform ones pre-
scribed action ( karma ). Why is it auspicious for sannyäsés to
refrain from karma ? In other words, how will they attain the
highest welfare without performing action? The tattva  of karma
is extremely deep and difficult to understand. The word karma

in the Vedas , due to laziness.
2. Those who know the result of karma  to be perishable and
miserable become resentful. Being disgusted with karma , they
act for mokña .

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Of the three types of karma , the tattva  of karma  and akarma
is explained in this çloka beginning with  the word karmaëi .
Personalities such as Janaka Mahäräja, who were pure inheart, did not take sannyäsa  although they were endowed
with jïäna . Instead, they performed akarma  by following
niñkäma -karma -yoga. Those who can see that such actions
are not karma  are themselves not bound by karma . A karma-
sannyäsé  whose heart is impure, who lacks tattva-jïäna , and
who possesses mere intellectual knowledge of çästra , can only
deliver exalted speeches. But, those who can see karma  in the
akarma  of such sannyäsés , and who realise that bondage to
karma  leads only to a miserable destination, are actually wise.
The pure-hearted person mentioned above performs all types
of karma  but does not accept karma-sannyäsa.  On the other
hand, there are so-called karma-sannyäsés who consider
themselves to be knowledgeable, but who are actually proud
and garrulous. They do not seek higher association or follow
instructions, and they only praise themselves. Those impure-
hearted persons suffer miserably.
Çré Bhagavän has also said:
yas tv asaàyata-ñaò-vargaù / pracaëòendriya-särathiù
jïäna-vairägya-rahitas / tri-daëòam upajévati
surän ätmänam ätma-sthaà / nihnute mäà ca dharma-hä
avipakva-kañäyo smäd / amuñmäc ca vihéyate
Çrimad  Bhägavatam  (11.18.40-1)
Sometimes, a person who is bereft of jïäna  and vairägya  makes a
show of accepting tridaëòa , the symbol of sannyäsa , to maintain
his life. This is condemned if his intelligence, which should di-rect the senses, is instead controlled by the fiercely strong senses
and by the six invincible enemies (lust, anger, greed, illusion, prideÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !281
and envy). Such a person is the killer of his own soul. Completely
immersed in endless material desires, he denies the worshipabledevas , his own self and even Me, who am situated within his heart.
Thus he is ruined both in this world and in the next.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
All karma  performed by a niñkäma -karma -yogé is akarma
(inaction) in the form of karma-sannyäsa.  Renunciation of
the fruits of action ( karma-tyäga ) constitutes  his performance
of niñkäma -karma . Although niñkäma-karma-yogés  perform all
types of actions, they are not considered to be karmés  (fruitive
workers). For them karma  and akarma  are the same. On the
other hand, so-called jïänés  who have artificially renounced
their prescribed duties ( karma-sannyäsa ), but whose conduct
is poor ( duräcäré ) due to their impure hearts, who are proud,
and who praise themselves, suffer miserable consequences.

fruits of action, and samärambhäù  refers to all actions which

perform vikarma , as described in Gétä 4.17, should be under-

yajïa . What is the nature of yajïa ? In anticipation of this
question, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with theÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !287
word brahmärpaëam . Arpaëam  refers to the instrument with
which the offering is made. The ladle used in the sacrifice andother such instruments are brahma . Haviù  (the ghee, etc.)
which is offered is also brahma . Brahmägnau  means the rest-
ing place of the recipient of the offering or fire, is brahma . The
brähmaëa  who performs the yajïa  is also brahma . Thus, brahma
is the only desirable object for a wise man. There is no otherresult. If one asks why, the answer is th at activity, which is
identical to, or in oneness with brahma , leads to samädhi , ex-
clusive concentration of the mind. Thus, no other fruit is ob-tained.
S

In sacrificial acts, the specific instrument used to offer ghee
in the fire is called sruva . The ingredients offered to the devas
in the yajïa  are called haviù .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Now,
hear how work in the form of yajïa  gives rise to knowledge.
I will explain various types of yajïa  later. Now, I will explain
the fundamental principle behind them. Material actions arecompulsory for the jéva bound to material consciousness. In
such mundane activities, the faithful discharge of prescribedduties in which one can deliberate on cit-tattva  (the conscious
reality) is called yajïa . When conscious reality manifests in
matter, it is called brahma . That brahma  is merely My bodily
effulgence. C it-tattva  is quite distinct from the whole material
universe. Yajïa  is perfect when its five constituents, namely
arpaëam (the instrument for offering), haviù (the ingredi-
ents), agni (the fire), hotä (the doer) and phala  (the fruit),
are the resting place of brahma , that is, when they are meant
for the revelation of brahma . A persons activity is known
as brahma-yajïa  when he seeks revelation of brahma in his
karma with concentrated meditation. The instruments of
offering, the ingredients, the fire, the doer (that is, his own25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 288
existence) and the fruits are all brahma . Thus their ultimate
destination is also brahma .

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän is saying, There are various types of yajïa
according to the varieties of desired goals. Now hear of themall. Çré Bhagavän speaks eight çlokas  beginning with the pre-
sent one, daivam eva , to explain these different types of yajïa .
Yajïa  in which the worship of devas  such as Indra and Varuna
is performed is called daivam . The performers of such yajïa
do not consider devas  like Indra and others to be brahma . This is
being explained here. According to the sütra : säsya-devatetyaëa ,
the devas  are the only worshipable deities for those perform-
ers of the deva-yajïa ; brahma  is not mentioned here. In this
çloka , yoginaù  means karma-yogés , while apare  implies jïäna -
yogés . Brahmägnau  means that brahma  or Paramätmä is the
sacrificial fire. In that sacrificial fire or tat-padärtha (the
Absolute Truth) the yajïam  (haviù , oblation) in the form ofÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !289
tvaà-padärtha  (the jéva) is the yajïena , which is offered by
chanting the präëava-mantra , oà. This very jïäna -yajïa  will
be glorified later. Here, the words yajïam  and yajïena  have
been used for the object which is offered (such as ghee) andthe instrument of the offering (the ladle) respectively. In otherwords, it is understood that the  çuddha-jéva  and präëava  are
indicated by a superior understanding of yajïa and yajïena .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura expresses Kåñëas mood as fol-
lows, Those who take the vow to perform yajïa  are called
yogés . There are various types of yajïa according to the dif-
ferent aptitudes of the yogés . In fact, there are as many vari-
eties of  yajïas  as there are types of yogé. All yajïas  can be
divided into two general divisions based on vijïäna , scien-
tific understanding: 1)  karma -yajïa , consisting of sacrificial
offerings and 2) jïäna -yajïa , sacrifice in the form of delib-
eration on cit-tattva . This will be explained further on. Now,
please hear as I explain some varieties of yajïas . The karma -
yogés  perform their worship through deva-yajïa , the worship
of My authorised representatives such as Indra and Varuëawho, by My external potency, are gifted with specific pow-ers. By such worship, these karma-yogés  gradually attain the
stage of niñkäma -karma -yoga. The yajïa of the  jïäna -yogés
consists of offering themselves ( tvaà-padärtha ) as the ghee
in the fire of brahma (tat-padärtha ) by reciting the präëava-
mantra , oà, or having taken shelter of the mahä-väkya  (great
axium),  tat-tvaà asi  (you are His servant). The superiority
of this jïäna-yajïa will be explained later on.

Apare  means the knower of pure tvaà-padärtha , namely
the pure self  (the jéva). These yogés  offer all of their senses,
the activities of the senses such as hearing and seeing, theten types of life airs ( präëa ), and the actions of the life airs
into the fire of the controlled self, or the fire of the purifiedexistence of tvaà-padärtha  (the jéva). In other words, they
completely dissolve the mind, the intelligence, the senses andthe ten life airs in the pure self. Their understanding is thatthe pratyag-ätmä  (pure soul) is all that exists, and that the
mind and so on do not have any real existence.
The ten types of life airs and their actions are as follows:

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ  VÅTTI
Here Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa is describing various types of
yajïa . Karma -yogés  give food, cloth and so on in charity, which
is their dravya-yajïa . They perform welfare activities that
are described in småti-çästra , such as digging wells and ponds,
establishing temples, giving food in charity and making parksand gardens. There are others who perform activities suchas protecting their dependents and taking a vow of non-vio-ÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !293
lence towards all jévas. Their activity is called datta-karma ,
charitable acts. There are others who perform yajïa  for the
purpose of pleasing the devas . Such activity is called iñöa-yajïa .
Some perform painfully austere vratas (vows), such as
candräyaëa , which are explained in Manu-saàhitä :
Kåcchra-vrata:
ekaikam gräsam açnéyät try-ahäni tréëi pürvava
try-ahaï copavased antyam atikåcchåaà caran dvijaù
Manu-saàhitä  11.214
For the first three days a person eats one mouthful of food dur-
ing the day. For the next three days he eats one mouthful dailyin the evening, and for the following three days he takes onemorsel of food a day without begging. For the last three days hefasts completely. This austere vow is called kåcchra-vrata .
Cändräyaëa-vrata:
ekaikaà hy asayet piëòaà kåñëe çukle ca varddhayet
upaspåçaàç tri-ñavaëam etac cändräyaëaà småtam
Manu-saàhitä  11.217
On the full moon day, a person should take only fifteen mouth-
fuls of food per day and take morning, midday and evening bath.From the first day of the lunar month onwards, he should reducehis food by one mouthful each day, and on the fourteenth day heshould eat only one mouthful. He has to fast completely on thedark moon day. From the first day of the bright fortnight onwards,he increases his meal by one mouthful each day, eating fifteenmouthfuls on the full moon day. This is called cändräyaëa-vrata .
There are others who perform yajïa  by devoting themselves to
yoga. Their yajïa  is to perform añöäìga -yoga while residing in a
pious place or holy place. Pataïjali  has said: Yogaç citta-våtti-
nirodha.  Yoga means to control the various activities of the mind.
The eight limbs of yoga are yama , niyama , äsana , präëäyäma ,28-29! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 294

Others, who are devoted to präëäyäma (controlling
the life force), offer präëa (the out-going breath) into
apäna  (the in-coming breath) and vice versa. By gradu-
ally stopping both präëa and apäna , they become fixed
in präëäyäma . Others, while checking the eating pro-
cess, offer their präëa into the fire of präëa (life) itself.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Some yogés , who are devoted to the control of their life airs,
sacrifice präëa into apäna.  This means that at the time of
püraka  (inhalation) they combine the präëa and apäna.
Similarly, during the time of recaka  (exhalation), they offer
apäna into präëa , and at the time of kumbhaka  (holding theÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !295
breath) they stop the movement of both präëa and apäna
and become fixed in präëäyäma .
Others, who want to control the senses, sacrifice their
senses into präëa , the life airs, by moderating their food in-
take. The senses are under the control of präëa . When the
life air becomes weak, naturally the senses also become weakand unable to enjoy their sense objects. In this way, they offerthe disabled senses into their life airs, living only on theirlife airs ( präëa ).
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Añöäìga-yoga  (the eightfold path of yoga) is being explained
in more detail. Yogés  sacrifice präëa  into apäna  through
püraka  (inhalation). In other words, at the time of püraka ,
they combine the präëa  and apäna . Similarly, while exhaling
(recaka ), they offer apäna into präëa  and at the time of
kumbhaka  (holding the breath), they stop the movements of
both präëa and apäna.
The word präëäyäma  has two components. Präëa  means a
special type of air and  äyäma  means expansion. Here, expan-
sion means to control the präëa  from the tip of the toenails
to the hair on top of the head. In Garuòa Puräëa  it is said:
präëäyämo maruj-jayaù. To control the präëa air is called
präëäyäma . Therefore, präëäyäma  means expanding präëa
for the purpose of controlling the activities of the senses.
Similarly, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.15.1 ) explains, When a
person controls his senses and his breathing process, and fully
absorbs his mind in Me, all the siddhis  naturally come under
his control. For more information on this subject, readers
should study Prema-Pradépa  by Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura.
The småti-çästra  describes yajïa  such as dravya-yajïa ,
tapo- yajïa , yoga-yajïa  and svädhyäya -jïäna -yajïa , while the
tantra-çästra  describes hatha-yoga  and various other types of
vows for controlling the senses. However, the best type of29! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 296
yajïa  in this Kali-yuga, when people have short life spans
and very little intelligence, is the natural and easily-perfectedsaìkértana-yajïa.  Not only every human but every living
entity has the right to perform saìkértana-yajïa :

yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair / yajanti hi su-medhasaù
By performing the saìkértana -yajïa , intelligent persons worship
that Personality in whose mouth the two syllables Kå and ñëa
are dancing, whose bodily colour is like brilliant gold, and who
is surrounded by His associates, servitors, weapons and confi-

activities of the body, mind and speech; therefore, they haveno relationship with the ätma-svarüpa  (true nature of the

all of these processes. Attainment of this jïäna  frees one from

Jïäna-yajïa  (as described in Gétä  4.25, brahmägnäu ), is

attaining jïäna . In other words, karma  ceases to exist after
one attains jïäna .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In his commentary on this çloka , Çréla Bhaktivinoda
Öhäkura quotes Çré Kåñëa as saying, Although all theseyajïas  gradually lead to jïäna , çänti  and finally to bhakti
unto Me, which is extremely auspicious for the jéva, still there
is something to be considered in this regard . From the above
group of yajïas , a person may sometimes perform either
dravya-maya-yajïa  or karma-yajïa (ceremonial rites). At
other times, depending on his niñöhä , he may perform jïäna-
maya-yajïa (a sacrifice performed in knowledge). Jïäna-
maya-yajïa  is far superior to dravya-maya-yajïa , because, O
Pärtha, all karma  culminates in jïäna . When the performance
of any yajïa  does not involve deliberation on the transcen-
dental, then the whole activity is simply ritualistic ( dravya-
maya ). However, when the goal is spiritual progress, the karma-
yajïas lose their fruitive materialism and become transcen-
dental. The dravya-maya  stage of yajïa , which consists only
of material rituals, is called karma-käëòa . One must remain
very conscious of this distinction while performing yajïa .
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has also said, Only those who
perform bhajana  to Çré Kåñëa by saìkértana-yajïa  make
their lives successful, and they are most intelligent. All others
are foolish slayers of the self. Kåñëa-näma-yajïa  is su-

açvamedha-yajïas  cannot be equated with once chanting the
name of Kåñëa. Those who make such comparisons are
päñaëdé , religious impostors, and Yamaräja punishes them
in various ways. This is emphasised in Caitanya-caritämåta
(Ädi lélä

Moreover, ones bondage to the material world is easily un-

in the age of Kali, all yajïas  except the chanting of Kåñëas

of svarüpa-dharma , the eternal occupation of the soul. This is
further clarified in Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi-lélä  7.73-74).

Acquire this jïäna  by offering prostrated obeisances
to a guru  who imparts transcendental knowledge, by
asking relevant questions from him and by renderingservice to him. The 
tattva darñé , who are expert in the
imports of çästra , and the jïänés , who have realised the
Absolute Reality, will enlighten you with that jïäna .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
How can this knowledge be attained? Çré Bhagavän speaks
this çloka  beginning with tad-viddhi  to give this information.
After offering daëòavat-praëämas  unto a guru  who gives
instructions in transcendental knowledge, one should in-quire as f ollows:  Äho Bhagavän! (Gurudeva is addressed as
Bhagavän here because he is äçraya  Bhagavän, the supreme34! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 302
receptacle of love for Bhagavän, and because the sad-guru
has qualities of Bhagavän), Why am I in this material con-dition? How can I become free from it? One must satisfyhim by sevä and by paricaryä , attending to his personal needs.
It is also said in the çrutis :
tad-vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigacchet
samit-päëiù çrotriyaà brahma-niñöham
Muëòaka Upaniñad  1.2.12
To acquire jïäna  of Çré Bhagavän, one should approach a guru
who knows the real import of the Vedas  by carrying samidh  (the
fuel wood of sublime faith) as an offering to him.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Here, Çré Kåñëa describes bhagavat-tattva-jïäna  as extremely
rare and difficult to understand. It can only be understood
by the mercy of a mahä-puruña who is a tattva-jïäné , one
who knows the Truth, and more specifically a tattva-darçé ,
one who has realised the Truth. Sincere sädhakas  should
inquire from such a mahä-puruña  about this tattva and please
him by offering prostrated obeisances, by asking relevant
questions and by rendering service to him.
Praëipätena means to affectionately offer praëämas with
either eight or five limbs of the body. Praëäma  or namaskära
means to give up ones false ego and bow down. Here sevä
means to render favourable service for the pleasure of the guru.
This çloka  describes two symptoms of a guru  who bestows
transcendental knowledge; he is both a jïäné  and a tattva-
darçé . One who has studied çästra  and understood the knowl-
edge in it is called a jïäné , while a tattva-darçé  is a mahä-
puruña  who has direct realisation of tattva .
Persons possessing incomplete knowledge do not have di-
rect realisation of tattva  and tat-padärtha . The instructions
of such unrealised persons are not fruitful. Only the instruc-ÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !303
tions of a mahä-puruña are fruitful. Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.3.21 ) also says: tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù . Çréla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments on this çloka as
follows: To know supreme auspiciousness and eternal well-
being, sädhakas  should accept the shelter of a guru  who is
expert in çabda-brahma  (the imports of Vedic  çästra ), who
has realised parabrahma , and who has no material attach-
ments. If he is not expert in or knowledgeable of çabda-
brahma , he will not be able to dispel the doubts of his dis-
ciples and they will lose  faith in him. If a guru  has no direct
realisation of parabrahma , his mercy does not fructify to the
fullest extent, nor yield the highest result. Here the word
upasamäçraya (11.3.21 ) refers to the guru who is endowed with
realisation of parabrahma . This means that he does not fall
under the sway of lust, anger, greed, etc. because he has no
material attachments.
This is further clarified in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.11.18 ):
çabda-brahmaëi niñëäto / na niñëäyät pare yadi
çramas tasya çrama-phalo / hy adhenum iva rakñataù
Taking shelter of a guru  who is expert in knowledge of çabda-
brahma , but is bereft of parabrahma  realisation, is like protecting
a barren cow. It is useless labour and one does not achieve any
transcendental result.
Bhagavad-gétä  states that Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Tran-
scendental Reality. There are those who say that the word
tat in this çloka  refers to the jévätmä , but such understanding
is completely incorrect because it contradicts the next çloka .
In Vedänta-darçana  it is also said: anyärthaç ca parämarçaù
(Brahma-sütra  1.3.20). The word tat refers to paramätma-
tattva-jïäna .35! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 304

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In the next three and a half çlokas  beginning here with
the words yaj jïätvä , Çré Bhagavän explains the fruit of jïäna .
After you have attained jïäna , by which one knows the ätmä
to be different from the body, your mind will not become de-luded again. By attaining sväbhävika nitya-siddha-ätma-
jïäna  (natural and eternally perfect knowledge of the self)
delusion is removed and you will see all living beings: hu-mans, animals, birds, etc. as jévätmäs appearing separately
due to their external covering or designations ( upädhis ). In
addition, you will see all of them in Me, parama-käraëa  (the
ultimate cause), situated as My effect (the jéva-çakti ).
S

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura expresses Kåñëas mood. Now,

(prescribed duty) which is to participate in battle, but after
attaining tattva-jïäna  as instructed by your guru , you will
no longer fall prey to delusion. By that tattva-jïäna  you will
be able to understand that all entities: human beings, animals,birds, etc., are situated in the same jéva-tattva . The various
levels of gross existence have occurred due to their externalbodily designations. All jévas are situated in Me, bhagavat-

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Now by speaking this çloka  beginning with api ced , Çré
Bhagavän describes the glories of jïäna . The word päpebhyaù
indicates, Even if you are the worst of sinners, this tattva-
jïäna  will liberate you from all past sins. Here, a question
arises. How is it possible that the mind will become purifiedwhen so many sins exist in it? And if the mind is not pure,how will jïäna  manifest? There is no possibility that a per-
son in whom jïana  has appeared will misbehave or commit36 - 37! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  4 306

Here, Çrépäda Madhusüdana Sarasvaté explains, The
words api ced  are spoken to indicate the possibility of the
impossible, by going against the rule. Although this mean-ing is not possible, it has been spoken of as a promise, in or-der to explain the fruit (glory) of jïäna . In other words, the
impossible has also been mentioned as a possibility.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
When jïäna  manifests in a pure mind, it burns up all karma
(reactions) except for prärabdha-karma . This is explained
with an example in this çloka  beginning with  the word yathä .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Jïäna  destroys the reactions of all sorts of karma  such as
nitya , naimittika , kämya , vikarma and accumulated aprärab-
dha, but not prärabdha -karma . This has been verified in
Vedänta-darçana :ÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !307
tad-adhigama uttara-pürvärghayor
açleña-vinäçau tad-vyäpadeçat
Brahma-sütra  4.1.13
Even a jïäni has to face the results of his prärabdha -karma.
According to Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, however, a person who hastaken shelter of the holy name, be it even nämäbhäsa  (a
semblance of pure chanting), not only destroys the results ofall his karma , such as accumulated  aprärabdha and küöa, but
also the fruits of prärabdha -karma.  What, then, is to be said
about the chanting of çuddha-näma ? Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has
written in Çré Nämäñöaka  (çloka  4):
yad-brahma-säkñät-kåti-niñöhayäpi
vinäçam äyäti vinä na bhogaiù
O Näma Prabhu! Your appearance on the tongue of Your bhaktas
burns up the results of prärabdha-karma , which is otherwise
unavoidable, even after realizing brahma  by unbroken medi-
tation. This is declared adamantly and repeatedly in the Vedas .

Here, it is said that tapasyä , yoga and other processes are
not as purifying as jïäna . Not everyone can attain this tran-

immature stage, but after attaining complete perfection inniñkäma -karma -yoga over a prolonged period of time. This
jïäna  reveals itself within ones self ( ätmä ). One does not
receive this transcendental knowledge merely by acceptingsannyäsa .

purified by the performance of niñkäma-karma  and when he
is endowed with proper intelligence, having an inclinationtowards the instructions of çästra . T at-paraù  means that,

After explaining the types of people who are qualified to
attain jïäna  and its subsequent result, Çré Kåñëa describes
the ignorant who are not qualified, and the degraded resultof such disqualification. A man who is ignorant, who lacksfaith and who is doubtful, perishes.
According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, ajïaù  here means ig-
norant of the topics instructed by Çré Guru . According to
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, it means that like an animal,
one does not have çästra-jïäna .
Those who do not have faith in the words of çästra , guru

always doubts the instructions of Hari, Guru and the Vaiñëa-vas is called saàçaya-ätmä , a man of doubt. Such doubtful

this stage by performing niñkäma -karma -yoga , giving up

by this process, it is illuminated by knowledge, and this cutsasunder all doubts. At that time, such people are completelyfreed from the bondage of karma .

Çré Bhagavän concludes this chapter with this çloka  begin-

in the heart ( chittvä ), yoga means taking shelter of niñkäma-
karma-yoga and ätiñöha  means be ready for the battle. Of
all the processes recommended for attaining mukti , jïäna  is
glorified here; and niskäma-karma  is the only means to at-
tain jïäna . This is the essence of this chapter.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-varñiëé Öékä ,
by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura , on the Fourth Chapter
of Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä , which gives pleasure to the bhaktas
and is accepted by all saintly persons.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, This chapter gives in-
structions on two divisions of sanätana-yoga  (the eternal yogaÇLOKA JÏÄNA -YOGA !313
system). The first is the jaòa-dravyamaya division, which con-
sists of mundane rituals, or the sacrifice of material posses-
sions. The second is the ätma-yathätmä-rüpa-cinmaya divi-
sion,  or knowledge of the self and of Bhagavän. When the
jaòa-dravyamaya division is performed separately, it simply
becomes karma . Those who are bound in this division are
known as karma -jaòa, deeply engrossed in mundane enjoy-
ment. However, those who perform jaòa-karma  (mundane
rituals) with the sole purpose of attaining spiritual advance-ment are yukta  or properly situated. When we specifically
deliberate on the true nature of spiritual activities, we un-derstand that there are two aspects. One is knowledge of jéva-
tattva  and the other is knowledge of bhagavat-tattva.  Only
those who experience and realise bhagavat-tattva  attain the
essence of ätma-yathätmä  (knowledge of the real nature of
the ätmä ) which is to be Çré Kåñëas servant. This experience
is perfected by realisation of the transcendental birth and
activities of Bhagavän and of the jévas  eternal association
with Him. This subject is described in the beginning of thischapter. Bhagavän Himself is the first instructor of this nitya-
dharma . Because the jéva has become bound to inert matter
by the defect of his own intelligence, Bhagavän descends bythe prowess of His cit-çakti  and, by giving instruction on His
tattva , He makes the jéva eligible to participate in His lélä.
Those who say that the body, birth and activities of
Bhagavän are products of mäyä  are extremely foolish. People
attain Me according to the degree of purity (knowledge ofMy tattva ) with which they worship Me. All the activities
of the karma -yogés  are termed yajïa . The various types of
yajïa  in the world, such as daiva-yajïa , brahmacarya-yajïa ,
gåhamedha -yajïa , samyama -yajïa , añöäìga -yoga-yajïa , tapo-
yajïa , dravya -yajïa , svädhyäya -yajïa  and varëäçrama-yajïa ,
all constitute karma .
The only useful factor which is to be sought after in all these

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Karma  has been described as being superior to jïäna  to
encourage ignorant people to perform karma properly, and
thus ultimately to achieve unswerving perfection in  jïäna .
This Fifth Chapter explains knowledge  of the Absolute Truth
(tat-padärtha ) and the characteristics of those who have an
even-tempered nature. After hearing the last two çlokas  of
the previous chapter, Arjuna is now doubtful. He thinks thatKåñëa has contradicted Himself, and in this çloka  beginning
with the words sannyäsaà karmaëäm , he poses a question:
In the çloka,  yoga-sannyasta  (
Gétä  4.41), You have spoken
about karma-sannyäsa which appears when jïäna is produced
by the performance of niñkäma-karma-yoga. Again in the
çloka,  tasmad ajïana  (Gétä  4.42 ), You have spoken about
niñkäma-karma-yoga . But karma-sannyäsa  (renunciation of
action) and niñkäma-karma-yoga  (the yoga of selfless action)
have opposite natures, like moving and non-moving entities.It is not possible to perform them simultaneously. Should ajïäné  perform karma-sannyäsa,  or niñkäma-karma-yoga ? I
have not understood Your intention on this subject and amasking You to please tell me for certain which of these two isauspicious for me.

In the Second Chapter, Çré Kåñëa instructed Arjuna how
to perform niñkäma-karma-yoga  in order to attain jïäna,
which dispels ignorance. In the Third Chapter, He explained
that when one has attained  ätma-jïäna  (knowledge of the
self), there is no need to engage in karma  (prescribed duties),
because karma-yoga  is included in jïäna-yoga . It is a sign of
ignorance to consider jïäna  and karma  to be separate. AfterÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !317 2
concluding this, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa said in the Fourth
Chapter that to attain jïäna-niñöhä  (steadiness in knowl-
edge), which is the means to obtain ätma-jïäna , it is appro-
priate to first adopt niñkäma-karma-yoga . Arjuna knows that
these topics are very difficult to grasp, and he is inquiring
from Kåñëa as if he is in ignorance, so that common people
may easily understand. Initially, Kåñëa declared karma-
sannyäsa  or jïäna-yoga  to be superior. Now, however, He is
again giving instructions on niñkäma-karma-yoga . Arjuna has
said, It is impossible for one person to follow both of these
instructions at the same time, because they are contradic-
tory, just as it is impossible to be both stationary and in
motion, or for there to be light and darkness in the same
place. Please tell me clearly which of these two will bring
me auspiciousness? This is Arjunas fifth question.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Niñkäma -karma-yoga  is superior to karma-sannyäsa.  Even
if a jïäné  performs niñkäma -karma-yoga  there is no defect.
Actually its performance further purifies his heart and hethereby becomes more established in jïäna . One may ask, If
a karma-sannyäsé  is experiencing some disturbance in the
heart due to worldly desires, is he forbidden to engage inaction  (karma ) to pacify it? Çré Bhagavän answers that such
a disturbance in the heart ( citta) of a karma-sannyäsé is an
obstacle to the cultivation of jïäna.  If he accepts sense ob-
jects having once given them up, he becomes a väntäçé , one
who eats his own vomit.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In answer to Arjunas question, Çré Bhagavän is saying that
both jïäna-yoga  (karma-sannyäsa ) and niñkäma-karma-yoga
are auspicious. However, niñkäma-karma-yoga  is superior to
karma-sannyäsa  or jïäna-yoga,  because in niñkäma-karma-
yoga there is less possibility of fall-down. If a karma-sannyäsé
(a person who has abandoned action) develops a desire forsense gratification and falls down, he is called a väntäçé .
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (
7.15.36 ) also confirms this:
yaù pravrajya gåhät pürvaà / tri-vargävapanät punaù
yadi seveta tän bhikñuù / sa vai väntäçy apatrapaù
If a person renounces the sannyäsa-äçrama,  which is the perfec-
tion of tri-varga (religion, economic development and sense
gratification), and again enters household life, he is called aväntäçé , a shameless person who eats his own vomit.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  further says that one may criticise an
ill-behaved jïäné , but should not condemn an ananya-bhakta
in the same way, even if his conduct is extremely poor. Thisis also confirmed in Gétä  (
9.30): api cet suduräcäraù .ÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !319 3
It should be clearly understood that  karma-käëòa  is not
the same as karma-yoga . Actions prescribed in çästra  are called
karma . When a jéva engages in action considering himself as
both the doer and the enjoyer of the fruits of action, his
activities are called karma-käëòa . In this case, even the pi-
ous activities prescribed in the Vedas  bind one to the mate-
rial world. Karma-käëòa  does not lead one to yoga (union)
with Çré Bhagavän, and thus it is condemned in all çästra .
Only by bhagavad-arpita niñkäma-karma , selfless actions
which are offered to Bhagavän, can yoga  with Him  be es-
tablished. This is called niñkäma-karma-yoga . It can be re-
ferred to as a semblance or beginning of bhagavad-dharma . It
can also be called the gateway to bhakti . In other words, an
indirect union with Bhagavän, is established by  niñkäma-
karma-yoga . Therefore in Gétä  (2.48) it is said: yoga-sthaù
kuru karmäëi. Being equally disposed to success and failure,
carry out your prescribed duties according to your nature.

It is possible to achieve the liberation which is attained by
sannyäsa  without entering the sannyäsa  order. For this pur-
pose, Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka  beginning with
jïeyah . O Mahä-bäho, you should understand that a pure-
hearted niñkäma-karma-yogé  is always a sannyäsé.  The ad-
dress O Mahä-bäho implies that one who is able to con-quer the realm of mukti  is certainly a great hero ( mahä-véra ).
S

This çloka  establishes why niñkäma-karma-yoga  is superior.
Due to the purity of his heart, a niñkäma-karma-yogé  is called
a fixed renunciate  (nitya-sannyäsé ). Although he has not
accepted the dress of a sannyäsé , he remains blissfully absorbed
in bhagavat-sevä by offering himself and all sense objects at
Bhagaväns lotus feet. Detached from sense enjoyment andwithout any desire for the fruits of his actions, he remains
free from attachment and envy. Thus he is easily liberated
from bondage to the material world.

the result of both in the form of mokña .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
O Arjuna, you have asked which of these two is superior,
but this is not actually a question at all; the wise see no dif-
ference between them. For this purpose Çré Bhagavän is
speaking this çloka  beginning with säìkhya . Here, säìkhya,
which means jïäna-niñöhä  (being fixed on the level of jïäna ),
indicates one of its limbs, sannyäsa . Only children or fools
say that sannyäsa  is different from niñkäma-karma-yoga . The
wise do not think like this. This has been described in theprevious çloka : jïeyaù sa nitya-sannyäsé  (
Gétä  5.3). Thus, by
taking shelter of either, the result of both is attained.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
When the heart becomes purified by properly engaging in
niñkäma-karma-yoga , jïäna appears, after which one eventu-
ally achieves liberation ( mokña ). This is also the fundamental
purpose of karma-sannyäsa . Since the end result of both
niñkäma-karma-yoga  and karma-sannyäsa  is mukti they are
non-different. By following one of them, the result of both
is achieved. Although externally pravåtti  (the directions for
enjoying the material world according to the regulativeprinciples) appears to be different from nivåtti (the directions
for giving up the materal world for higher spiritual under-standing), the wise do not see a difference between them,since the result of both these processes is the same.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The jïänés  acceptance of karma-sannyäsa  without com-
plete purification of heart leads to misery. Niñkäma-karma-
yoga,  however, brings happiness, that is, it helps to attain
brahma . This feature was indicated earlier, and is further
clarified in this çloka  beginning with sannyäsas tu . When the
heart is disturbed by worldly desires, sannyäsa  becomes mis-
erable. Only niñkäma-karma-yoga  brings peace to the dis-
turbed heart.The word ayogataù means in the absence of
niñkäma -karma-yoga ; thus the renunciation of one who is
not qualified to take sannyäsa  becomes a cause of misery. The
author of Värtika-sütra  therefore says:
pramädino bahiçcittaù piçunäù kalahotsukäù
sannyäsino pi dåçyante daiva-sandüçitäñayäù
It is seen that even sannyäsés have agitated minds and are negli-
gent and eager to quarrel if their hearts are impure, due to their
long association with the illusory energy.
It is also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.18.40),  Tridaëòé-
sannyäsés  who are bereft of proper knowledge ( jïäna ) and
renunciation ( vairägya ) and who have not controlled their
five senses and the mind, lose both worlds.
Hence a niñkäma-karma-yogé,  after becoming a jïäné ,
quickly achieves brahma .

It is better to engage in niñkäma-karma-yoga  than to take
sannyäsa  before the heart is pure.

vijitätmä,  of pure mind, and (3) jitendriyaù, of controlled
senses. They are mentioned in order of the superiority of
their spiritual advancement. All jévas  are affectionate to
that householder who is properly engaged in niñkäma-karma

The pure soul has no connection with material activities.
Niñkäma-karma-yogés  become tattva-vit,  endowed with tran-
scendental knowledge, a gradual purification of heart. Theythen realise the nature of the self ( ätma-tattva ) and under-
stand that even when they perform bodily activities, theyare not the doers. They think that according to their pürva-
saàskära  (previous impressions) all activities of the mate-
rial body are automatically performed by the inspiration ofÉçvara. Due to the existence of the material body there maybe a feeling that they themselves are the performers of ac-
tion, yet when they give up the body after attaining perfec-
tion (siddhi ), there remains absolutely no feeling that they
are the doers of action. Any action performed by suchmahätmas  does not bind them to the material world.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has also said, When the

According to the previous statement, jïeyaù sa nitya-

attachment is in fact the real sannyäsé . To explain this, Çré
Kåñëa is speaking this çloka  beginning with sarva-karmäëi .
Although performing external activities related to the body,a self-controlled man, completely renouncing all actionsthrough his mind, remains happily situated. Where does sucha person live? Kåñëa replies, In the city of nine gates. Inother words, in a body freed from the false ego. In this case,the word dehé refers to the jéva who has attained jïäna .
Although he may perform karma , he knows that in reality
he is not the cause of the happiness that results from hisactions, and he therefore understands that actually he per-forms no work. Similarly, while engaging others in work hedoes not make them act, because he has no purpose to fulfil.In other words, he remains unconcerned by their actions.

Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.19.43 ) states: gåhaà çaréraà
mänuñyam. The human body is like a house. This subject
can be specifically studied in the narration concerningPuraïjana. The house of the human body has nine gates: thetwo eyes, two ears, two nostrils and one mouth are the sevengates in the head, and the lower gates are for evacuation andprocreation. A yogé sees his own self, or his own svarüpa,  as
being different from this body of nine gates. Like a traveller,the yogé does not become attached to or possessive of his body,
which is likened to a hotel. Instead, he performs exclusivesevä to Bhagavän, the master of all the senses.13! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  5 330

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Someone may question Bhagaväns partiality. If it is true
that the jéva has no tendency to act as the doer, then why,
throughout the material world which Éçvara has created, ishe seen as the doer and the enjoyer of the fruits thereof? Itappears that Éçvara created these tendencies, which are forcedupon the jéva. If this is so, then it means that He carries the
defect of being partial and without mercy. In response Hesays, No, no. Na karttåtvam.  He has used the word na three
times to stress and emphatically refute this point. He hasneither created the initiative, nor has he created the karma
in the form of prescribed duties, nor the result of karma,
which is sense enjoyment. It is only the conditioned natureof the jéva, in other words, his ignorance since time imme-
morial, which induces him to recognise the ego as being theprompter of action.ÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !331

The jévas are not initiators of their own actions. One
should not think from this statement that the jévas engage
in action only by the inspiration of Parameçvara. If this were
the case, He would possess defects such as being biased and
cruel. Besides, Bhagavän is not the agent who unites the jiva
with the results of his karma . This union occurs only because
of the jévas  ignorance from time immemorial ( anädi-avidyä ).
The divine material energy ( daivé-mäyä-prakåti ) in the form
of ignorance activates the acquired nature of the jéva. Only
those jévas who possess such a conditioned nature, which is
born of ignorance, are engaged in action by Parameçvara. He
Himself does not create the initiative within the jévas to act
or not to act.
Vaiñamya-nairghåëye doñair na säpekñatvät tathä hi
darçayati  (Brahma-sütra  2.1.34). According to this sütra ,
Parameçvara is completely free from such defects as being
biased or cruel.
It is mentioned in the Vedas,  that just as brahma  is anädi
(without beginning), so the karmika  impressions of the jévas
are also beginningless. The jévas  actions create impressions,
and Parameçvara simply engages them in their successive
activities according to these impressions. Thus it is illogical to
say that Parameçvara has the defect of partiality ( Chändogya
Upaniñad  6.2.1).
It is also said in the Bhaviñya Puräëa,  It is only according
to the impressions of past karma  that Çré Viñëu engages the
jéva in mundane activities. Since the jévas  impressions are
beginningless, Parameçvara is not guilty of any defect.
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa explains in his Govinda-
bhäñya,  Someone may conclude that since Parameçvara en-
gages a jéva in action according to the past impressions of
his karma,  we have to accept that Parameçvara is also not
independent, but is under the influence of karma.  The response14! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  5 332
is, No, this is not correct, since in reality even the existence
of karma  is under His control. Parameçvara engages the jéva
in karma  according to the nature he has acquired since time
immemorial. Although Éçvara can change this nature, Henever does. Thus, in all circumstances, He is free from par-tiality.

Éçvara does not prompt or inaugurate the jévas good or bad
actions, for the same reason that He Himself does not incur
sin or piety. For this purpose, He speaks this çloka  beginning
with nädatte . It is only His avidyä-çakti  that covers the fine
knowledge of the jéva. To explain this He says ajïänena ,
meaning that the inborn or natural knowledge of the jéva
becomes covered by ignorance, and it is due to this that he
becomes deluded.ÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !333

Bhagavän is vibhuù , all-pervading and boundless. He is full
in realisation, bliss  and unlimited energy. He is always ab-
sorbed in His own nature, the ocean of änanda . As He is
indifferent to everything, He does not prompt good or baddeeds. Çré Bhagavän is ätmäräma  (self-satisfied) and
äptakäma  (He whose every desire is fulfilled). It is His avidyä-
çakti  which covers the natural and inborn knowledge of the
jéva, and by it the jéva in the conditioned state identifies
himself with the body. The jéva develops the ego of being the
doer of his actions only because he falsely identifies the bodyas the self.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (6.16.11) states:
nädatta ätmä hi guëaà / na doñaà na kriyä-phalam
udäsénavad äsénaù / parävara-dåg éçvaraù
The jévätmä  of Citraketu Mahäräjas dead son gave this instruc-
tion to Citraketu Mahäräja, who was suffering from lamenta-tion. The Paramätmä,  Éçvara, does not accept happiness or dis-
tress, or the results of actions such as the attainment of a king-dom. He witnesses the cause and effect of ones actions and,because he is not under the control of the material body andevents, he remains indifferent.

But for those whose ignorance  has been destroyed

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Just as Çré Bhagaväns avidyä-çakti  covers the jévas  knowl-
edge, so His vidyä-çakti  destroys ignorance and reveals his pure
knowledge. By jïäna  or vidyä-çakti (the potency of knowl-
edge), avidyä  is destroyed.
Just as the suns rays dispel darkness and illuminate the
earth, the sky and other objects, similarly vidyä  destroys ig-
norance and illuminates that parama-apräkåta-jïäna (knowl-
edge of the transcendental Çré Bhagavän). Thus, Parameçvaraneither binds nor liberates anyone. Rather, it is only igno-rance and knowledge which bind and liberate respectivelyaccording to the qualities of material nature. The tendencyto enjoy or to initiate action  is the cause of bondage. Simi-
larly, detachment, peace and so forth are liberating. Theseare qualities of prakåti.  Parameçvara is only partly respon-
sible for the instigation of actions, because, due to His beingAntaryämé (the Supersoul), all the qualities of material na-ture become manifest. Hence, there is no possibility that theimperfections of partiality or cruelty exist in Him.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
According to his own material desires, the jéva acquires a
body from material nature and engages in karma .
Parameçvara does not determine the jévas  sinful or pious
actions. Both the piety of the advancing sädhaka and the sin
which degrades him occur as a result of his previous saàskäras
(impressions). To punish the jéva, Çré Bhagaväns mäyä-çaktiÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !335
covers his constitutional nature. The jéva then begins to
identify the self with the body and subsequently considershimself to be the doer of all his actions. Parameçvara canin no way be blamed for this condition of the jéva.
Two of mäyä-çaktis functions, avidyä  and vidyä,  are instru-
mental in the bondage and liberation of the jéva respectively.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.11.3) it is said:
vidyävidye mama tanü viddhy uddhava çarériëäm
mokña-bandha-karé ädye mäyayä me vinirmite
O Uddhava, both avidyä  and vidyä  are functions of My mäyä-
çakti .
 According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, here
vidyä  bestows mokña  and avidyä  is the cause of bondage. There
are three functions of mäyä : pradhäna , avidyä and vidyä .
Pradhäna  creates a designation for the jéva which is not real,
although it appears to be so. Avidyä  falsely super-imposes such
designations to be real, and by vidyä  such super-impositions
are easily removed. Here it must be properly understood thatthe gross and subtle bodily designations of the jiva, which
are created by pradhäna  are not false, but the concept of I
and mine in both of them is false. In the Vedas  and
Upaniñads  this is called vivartta .
Within Parameçvara, the natural ego of being the doer is
eternally present. Prakåti  is His inert çakti.  Simply by His
glance,  the function of prakåti is instigated. Consequently,
prakåti  is the secondary cause of the creation of the material
world. Parameçvara is indeed its instigator, but only in an
indirect or partial manner.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, Knowledge  is of two
types: präkåta (mundane) and apräkåta (transcendental) .
Präkåta, meaning knowledge related with inert matter, is
called avidyä  or the ignorance of the jéva. Apräkåta-jïäna  is
called vidyä . When the material knowledge of the jéva has16! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  5 336
been destroyed by spiritual knowledge, that same spiritual
jïäna  is revealed as the supreme spiritual jïäna,  and enlight-
ens him about the apräkåta-parama-tattva,  The supra-mun-
dane truth.

Vidyä  illuminates knowledge of the jévätmä  only, not of
Parameçvara. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.14.21 ) it is said:
bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù. I can only be attained by bhakti .
To attain knowledge  of Paramätmä, the jïänés  must again
specifically practise bhakti-sädhana . Çré Bhagavän speaks this
çloka  beginning with tad-buddhayaù  to explain this. Here,
the word tat (tad) refers to the same all-pervading Parameçvara
described earlier. T ad-buddhayaù  means that those whose
intelligence is fixed in that Parameçvara meditate on HimÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !337
only. T ad-ätmä  means those who are solely absorbed in Him.
Jïänaà ca mayi sannyaset. Even a jïäné  should surrender
his jïäna  to Me (Ç rémad Bhägavatam  11.19.1 ).
According to this statement, even if he has knowledge that
the self is separate from the body, he is not called tat-niñöhäù
unless he has given up his niñöhä  (fixed steadiness) in sättvika
bhäva  and has developed exclusive niñöhä  in bhagavad -bhakti .
T at-paräyaëäù  means those who are devoted to hearing and
chanting about Him.
It is said later in Gétä  (18.55 ):
bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù
tato mäà tattvato jïätvä viçate tad-anantaram
It is only by bhakti  that one can know Me as I am and thus attain
Me. Therefore, those whose ignorance has been completely
destroyed by knowledge attain knowledge of Paramätmä.

in the form of sättvika-jïäna  can destroy ignorance ( ajïäna ),
it cannot cause knowledge of Paramätmä to appear.  Gétä

The wise who are extremely devoted to Parameçvara, as
mentioned in the previous çloka, transcend the material
modes ( guëätéta ) and become disinterested in accepting the
guëas which exist in every entity to varying degrees. Thus
they become equipoised. To explain this, Çré Bhagavän is
speaking this çloka  beginning with vidyä-vinaya . A cow and
a brähmaëa  are said to be in sattva-guëa , thus they are su-
perior to the elephant which is in rajo-guëa,  and to the dog
and the dog-eater ( cäëòäla ) which are in tamo-guëa.  But the
paëòitas  who have transcended the modes do not notice such
differences. Rather, they see brahma  which is beyond the
modes everywhere. They are known as sama-darçé,  those
with equal vision.

specific svarüpa  in every material body. Only such seers of
the self ( ätma-darçé ) are known as sama-darçé . Bhagavän has
clarified this further in Gétä  (6.32) and it is described in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.29.14 ):

or lobha . The deepest meaning of the word käma , which in
this context indicates all types of desires, is the desire to gainpleasure by the mutual combination of man and woman. Theminds excessive repulsion (envy) towards that which isunfavourable to sense-enjoyment is called krodha.  Those who
can tolerate the urges of käma  and krodha  until the time of
death are known as yogés,  and they are happy.

A yogé who is happy within the self, who takes plea-

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
For those who are untouched by the conditions of the
material world, the experience of brahma  itself is pleasurable.
To explain this, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning
with the words yo ntaù . Those who achieve bliss within their
inner self take pleasure only in the self, and thus their visionis focused within.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
How the strong urges of käma  and krodha  can be easily
and naturally pacified is being explained here by ÇréBhagavän. By experiencing the self, such urges can be easilycontrolled. Yogés  who experience happiness in realisation of
the self, who take pleasure within the self, and whose visionis always focused on the nature of the self, take shelter of
niñkäma-karma  and attain the stage of brahma-bhüta, the
nature of brahma. They eventually become established in
their own ( jéva) svarüpa . Such yogés  easily become indiffer-
ent to the mundane sensual activities of käma, krodha,  etc.,
and experience bliss within the self, known as brahma-nirväëa .
In Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkuras commentary on Gétä  
5.26,
he says, A sannyäsé  who is free from käma  and krodha , who
has control over the mind, and who knows ätma-tattva , very
quickly attains full realisation of brahma-nirväëa .ÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !345
After deliberation on real and unreal objects, a niñkäma-
karma-yogé while living in the material world, situates him-
self in brahma , the reality which is beyond the modes of
material nature. Such a state, which is free from material
miseries, is called brahma-nirväëa .

He who is free from desire, fear and anger completely
removes the external sense objects, such as sound andtouch from his mind. He then fixes his vision betweenthe eyebrows and suspends the upward and downwardmovement of the 
präëa  and apäna  air, which moves
in both nostrils. In this way, he balances the life-airs, controls his senses, mind and intelligence, anddedicates himself to attaining 
mokña . Such a sage is
certainly always liberated.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In this way, by performing niñkäma-karma-yoga  offered to
Éçvara, the sädhaka  achieves a pure heart. It is then that
knowledge of the self ( tvaà-padärtha ) appears. To gain knowl-
edge of tat-padärtha (brahma ), one has to cultivate bhakti.
Finally one experiences brahma (Çré Bhagavän) by guëätéta-
jïäna,  which is born from bhakti . For a person whose heart
has been purified by niñkäma-karma-yoga , the performance of
añöäìga-yoga  is superior to jïäna-yoga,  which is the process to
realise brahma . This is explained in the Sixth Chapter. Here
Çré Bhagavän is speaking these three çlokas  beginning with
the word sparçän  as a sütra of the Sixth Chapter . Sparçän
refers to all external senses: eyes, ears, tongue, nose and skin.All of them enter the mind; so one should drive them outand restrain the mind from running towards them. Ones27 - 28! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  5 348
vision should be fixed between the eyebrows. If one com-
pletely closes the eyes there is the possibility that he will fallasleep, and if one keeps them completely open, there is thepossibility that he will be distracted by the objects of thesenses. Thus, to ensure that neither occurs, one should keepthe eyes half open, and within the nostrils control the up-ward and downward movement of präëa  and apäna  in the
form of the out-going and in-coming breath, thus balancingthem. Those who control their senses in this way are to beconsidered liberated.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, the heart becomes purified only by niñkäma-karma-
yoga offered to Me. After purifying the heart, one attains
jïäna,  which then gives rise to jïäna-svarüpa-bhakti,  bhakti
in the form of knowledge. This is the means to determine
tat-padärtha  (brahma ). Finally, the experience of brahma
comes from bhakti  performed with guëätéta-jïäna . I have
explained this to you previously. Now I will explain añöäìga-
yoga as the means to realise brahma  for one whose heart has
been purified. I am presenting statements just to give an idea
of this. Please listen. The external forms of sound, touch,form, taste and smell are to be completely removed from the
mind. While practising control of the mind in this way, fix
the eyes between the eyebrows and look at the tip of the nose.
By completely closing the eyes there is the possibility of falling
asleep, and by completely keeping them open, there is the
possibility of being distracted by external objects. One should
therefore control the eyes by keeping them half-closed insuch a way that ones vision falls between the eyebrows on
to the tip of the nose. Breathing through the nostrils, the out-
going präëa  and the in-coming apäna should be regulated so
that the upward and downward movement is balanced. Thus,ÇLOKA KARMA -SANNYÄSA -YOGA !349
seated with controlled senses, mind and intelligence, sages
aiming at mukti give up desire, fear and anger and practise
with the aim of realizing brahma . In this way they can at-
tain complete deliverance from material bondage.Thus, aspart of the sädhana  of niñkäma-karma-yoga , its limb añöäìga-
yoga can also be practised.

bhakti . For this reason, know Me to be the worshipable ob-
ject of devotees also. Since I am nirguëa,  it is not possible to
realise Me by jïäna  in sattva-guëa . In Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.14.21) I declared: bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù.  I can be
achieved only through bhakti . Only through nirguëa bhakti
can the yogés  realise My partial aspect, Paramätmä, as their
worshipable object, and attain çänti  or mokña .
Jïänés  and karma -yogés  attain knowledge of both the
jévätmä  and Paramätmä through niñkäma-karma , and so
attain mukti . This is the essence of this chapter.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä,

worshipable object of the yogés , the well-wisher of all jévas,
and He is maheçvara, the Supreme Controller of all planets.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, After hearing the
first four chapters, a doubt could arise. If one attains mokña
as the result of niñkäma-karma-yoga , then what place does
jïäna-yoga  have, and how does it manifest? The instruc-
tions in this chapter have been spoken to remove this doubt.Jïäna-yoga (säìkhya-yoga ) and niñkäma-karma-yoga  are
non-different from each other, for they share the same su-preme goal, namely  bhakti . In the initial stages of niñkäma-
karma-yoga,  karma predominates over  jïäna,  and in the
final stage ( jïäna-yoga ), jïäna predominates  over karma .
By constitutional nature the jéva is a pure, conscious en-
tity. However, he becomes bound by inert matter becausehe desires to enjoy mäyä,  and as he identifies himself with
matter, gradually his constitutional position becomes morecovered. As long as this material body exists, materialaction is necessary. The only way for the baddha -jéva to
attain liberation  is through cit-ceñöä,  or the endeavour to
revive his constitutional state. To the same degree of in-tensity with which he makes efforts to revive his originalconscious state during his journey within the materialbody, the predominance of karma  becomes weak. Brahma-
nirväëa  (deliverance from mundane bondage and contact
with the pleasure of brahma ) appears automatically while
performing sädhana  to develop equal vision, detachment,
control over mundane lust and anger and the eradicationof all doubts, etc. While practising karma-yoga as well as
maintaining the body, one can also perform añöäìga-yoga-
sädhana  which is comprised of the eight processes: yama ,
niyama , äsana , pratyähära , präëäyäma , dhyäna , dhäraëä
and samädhi . The bliss of bhagavad-bhakti  gradually mani-
fests during the performance of such sädhana, if one at-
tains the association of a bhakta . This is called mukti-
pürvikä çänti , everlasting peace accompanied by mukti.29! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  5 352
Here,  mukti means being situated in ones own  svarüpa .
At that time, the tendency to perform pure bhajana  illumi-
nates the glory of the constitutional nature of the jéva.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The Sixth Chapter deals with the various types of yoga
performed by yogés whose minds are self-controlled. It also
explains the means to control the flickering mind.
A person who is engaged in the practice of añöäìga-yoga
(the eightfold yoga system) should not suddenly give up
niñkäma-karma (selfless action), which purifies the heart. For
this reason Çré Bhagavän says, Those who perform their
prescribed duties knowing them to be obligatory, without
desiring the results, and who have renounced the fruits oftheir actions, are actual sannyäsés.  Since their minds are free
from desires for sense enjoyment, such persons are also called
yogés . Niragni means that a person is not called a sannyäsé
simply because he has abandoned all karma  (action) such as
performance of the agni-hotra-yajïa . Akriyaù  means that a
person is not called a yogé simply because he has given up all
bodily activities, and sits motionless with half-closed eyes.

Añöäìga-yoga  was described in a condensed form ( sütra )
in three çlokas at the end of the Fifth Chapter. In the Sixth
Chapter, the subject of these three çlokas  is explained in detail.
The word agni-hotra  mentioned in the commentary is a
special type of Vedic yajïa  performed to satisfy the  agni-
devatä . According to this procedure, at the end of a marriage
ceremony, the brähmaëas  should perform a yajïa  by estab-
lishing the fire and chanting Vedic mantras prescribed for
the spring season. At that time, one makes a determined vowto perform the yajïa with some particular substance (such as
ghee). After that, it should be performed with that substanceonly for the rest of ones life. On the amävasya  (dark-moon)
night, the person has to perform the yajïa  himself with barley
water. On other days there is no discrepancy, even if there is
some variation. When one has performed a hundred yajïas ,ÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !355 2
one must perform a yajïa  to the sun during the morning, and
to the fire at twilight. It is imperative to commence daça
purëamäsa-yäjïa  while meditating on the fire on the first
full-moon day. Besides that, one has to perform three yajïas
on the purnima and three on the amävasya , and must per-
form these six yajïas  for the rest of his life. The çat-patha-
brähmaëa  section of the Vedas  explains in great detail the
results obtained by performing this yajïa.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The self ( ätmä ) falls into the ocean of the material world
only because of his attachment to sense objects. With greatÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !359
endeavour one must deliver the self. Ätmanä , the mind which
is detached from sense objects, delivers ätmänam , the jéva.
Na avsädayet  means that the mind which is attached to sense
objects should not cause the ätmä to fall into the material
ocean. In this way the ätmä  (mind) is the friend and also
the enemy of the jéva.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The mind which is free from any attachment is ones friend,
and the mind which is full of attachment is ones enemy. It issaid:

fered to Bhagavän. In this way, he should try to fix his mind
in samädhi , meditating deeply on Çré Bhagavän. He should
perform his sädhana without any material desires, and with
staunch renunciation, reside in a solitary place, control his
mind, and refrain from all activities which are unfavourable
to yoga.

If the sitting posture is firm and comfortable, it helps in
ones spiritual practice. There are sixty-four types of posturessuch as svastika , mayüra , garuòa  and padma . Pataïjali has
also said: sthira-sukham äsanam.  The äsana should be firm
and comfortable. In Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (
2.8) the pro-
cess of äsana  has been explained: Keeping the torso, head
and neck in a straight line and controlling all the senses, oneÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !367
should practise yoga by absorbing ones mind in meditating
on brahma situated in the heart. Such learned sädhakas cross
over the terrible ocean of käma  and krodha  in the material
world by the boat of brahma .
If one doubts the need to adopt an äsana  (posture) for the
gross body while remembering Bhagavän within the mind,Vedänta-sütra (
4.1.7) says: äsénaù sambhavät.  One should
remember Çré Hari while sitting in a firm äsana . Çréla Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa explains in his Govinda-bhäñya , It is not
possible to concentrate the citta (thoughts) without an äsana.
While walking, moving, standing and sleeping, the thoughtsremain distracted. In such circumstances it is not possible tomake the citta one-pointed.
This is also cited in Çrémad-Bhägavatam from:  çucau deçe
pratiñöhäpya (
3.28.8 ) up to hetutvam apy asati (3.28.36 ), and
also ( 11.14.32 ) sama äsana äsénaù . These çlokas are of great
value in helping to understand this topic in more detail.
In the yoga-çästra also it is said: antar-lakñyo bahir dåñtih

A persons worldly and transcendental activities will lead
to success if he is regulated in eating ( ähära ) and recreation
(vihära ).
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
If a person is not moderate in eating and recreation, he faces
various miseries that become an obstacle in his sädhana . Simi-
larly, if the mind is flickering and agitated because of various
anxieties, it is also not possible for him to attain perfection inhis sädhana . Therefore, in a balanced manner, the sädhaka
should eat food which is easily digestible and nourishing. It isimperative for the bhakti-sädhaka to follow the instructions
given by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his book, Çré Upadeçämåta ,
wherein it is said that only a person who controls the urges ofthe mind, anger, tongue and genitals can perform sädhana
properly. Additionally, one should always keep a distance fromthe six unfavourable activities: over-eating, over-endeavour-ing, talking unnecessarily, having undue attachment to or dis-regard for rules and regulations, taking bad association andmaintaining a strong desire to follow false philosophy.
In this çloka , the words yukta-svapnävabodhasya mean

In that state of yoga called samädhi , the yogés mind
is controlled by the practice of yoga. He becomes de-
tached from the sense objects, and is satisfied withinby realising the self through that purified 
citta (mind).
In that state, the yogé experiences eternal bliss through
his transcendental intelligence, which is beyond therealm of the senses. Being thus established, he neverdeviates from his 
ätma-svarüpa  (intrinsic nature) and
upon attaining ätma-sukha (the bliss of the self), he
considers there to be no greater acquisition. When heis situated on that platform, he does not become per-turbed even by the greatest of miseries. Know thatstate to be devoid of any contact with the duality ofmundane happiness and misery. This 
yoga should be
performed with full patience of mind, having com-pletely given up all whimsical desires and, with themind controlling the senses from all directions, oneshould follow the instructions of 
çästra and sädhu  with
determination. One should make his intelligence reso-lute and determined, and should gradually becomedetached by establishing the mind in the self and bynot thinking of anything else.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The word yoga in the çloka , näty-açnatas tu yoga sti
(Gétä 6.16) and in other çlokas  means samädhi . This
samädhi is of two types, namely samprajïäta , in which oneÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !375
is conscious of the difference between knowledge, the ob-
ject of knowledge and the knower,  and asamprajïäta , in
which no such difference is perceived . Samprajïäta has
various divisions such as sa-vitarka (argument)  and sa-
vicära (philosophical research). What is spontaneous or
asamprajïäta-samädhi-yoga ? To answer this, Çré Bhagavän
is speaking three and a half çlokas  beginning here with
the word yatroparamate .
When one attains samädhi , the citta  becomes fully de-
tached from sense objects and has no contact with them,because one has achieved self-restraint ( niruddha ). This
is confirmed in Pataïjalis Yoga-sütra : yogaç citta-våtti-
nirodhaù. When the citta-våtti (attention) is fully re-
strained from sense enjoyment and absorbed in the bliss-ful realisation of the self and Paramätmä, it is calledyoga 
The qualified yogé realises Paramätmä by his purified mind
and remains satisfied with that alone. This is his blissful
state, samädhi.  This samädhi  is attained by an intellect
which has become qualified to experience the self andParamätmä. This is because it is aténdriya (beyond the
senses), and beyond the happiness attained by contact ofthe senses with the sense objects. Wherever this yogé lives,
he does not deviate from his ätma-svarüpa and thus, after
attaining this blissful state, he considers the pursuit of anyother type of acquisition as insignificant. Even if there iscontact with misery, he does not experience it. This is yoga-
saàjïitam , or simply yoga , and only this can be called
samädhi. A yogé should not lament, I have not attained
perfection after so much time, so what is the purpose inundergoing all this pain? Rather, within his mind, he shouldmaintain firm patience. Whether perfection comes in thislife or in the next, I will continue to endeavour. Why should
I become impatient?25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  6 376
In this regard, Çré Gauòapäda, Çaìkaräcäryas  parama-
gurudeva , has given the example of vowing to dry up the ocean
by taking out a drop of water at a time with the tip of a piece
of kuça grass. Similarly, by untiring, determined endeavour,
a person can control the mind.
In this regard there is a story. Once a bird laid her eggs on
the shore of an ocean, but the waves carried the eggs away.
The bird resolved to dry up the ocean, and began to take water
out, drop by drop, in her beak. Other birds came to convinceher that her endeavour was futile, but she did not stop her
work. By chance, Çré Näradajé came to that place, and he
also tried to convince the bird to stop, but the bird took a
vow in his presence: I will not rest until I dry up the ocean,
whether it is in this life or in the next. Merciful Närada
then sent Garuòa to help her. When Garuòa heard that the
ocean had carried away the eggs of someone in his own caste,
he began to dry up the ocean by fanning it with his wings.
The ocean became terrified, and immediately gave the eggsback to the bird.
Thus it is certain that when a person begins the process
of yoga , jïäna  or bhakti  with faith in such statements of
çästra , Çré Bhagavän will definitely bless such enthusiastic
endeavour.
In the two çlokas  beginning with the word saìkalpa , Çré
Bhagavän is explaining the initial and ultimate activities of
a person engaged in such yoga. Abandoning all material de-
sires ( Gétä 
6.24) is the initial act and not worrying about
anything else, as spoken in Gétä (6.25), is the final act.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Words cannot describe the happiness that manifests in the
yogés pure heart when he attains perfection in yoga, and his
heart becomes cleansed by samädhi . It can only be realised
with ones purified mind.ÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !377
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, In this way, by the prac-
tice of yoga, the mind gradually becomes detached from sense
enjoyment and free from the control of all mundane objects.At that time, the stage of samädhi appears. In that state, the
mind becomes qualified to realise and experience Paramätmä,
thus realising the happiness born from that union. Pataïjali
Munis philosophical literature is the only bona fide litera-ture on añöäìga-yoga . Because commentators do not under-
stand its factual meaning, they say that, according to thevedänta-vädés  (propounders of Vedänta ), the attainment of
bliss and the conscious state of the self is called mokña . This
is unreasonable because, if bliss is accepted in the kaivalya
(liberated) stage of impersonal monism, then the duality ofthe experience and the one who has the experience will ex-ist. Thus it will not be kaivalya (oneness). But these com-
mentators do not understand what Pataïjali Muni means,
because in his last sütra he has said:
puruñärtha-çünyänäà guëänäà pratiprasavaù
kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä citi-çaktir iti
Yoga-sütra 3.34
The function of the real self ( cit-dharma ) awakens when one is
free from the four goals of human life ( dharma , artha , käma and
mokña ), and when the guëas  do not cause any worldly disturbance.
This state is called kaivalya (oneness). In this state one becomes
situated in ones own svarüpa . It is then called citi-çakti .
If we deeply deliberate on this it becomes clear that Pataïjali
Muni does not accept that the functions of the self are anni-hilated in its ultimate state; rather, he accepts that at that stageno transformation or perversion of its function takes place.Citi-çakti means cit-dharma . When there are no perverse trans-
formations in the proper functioning of the self, then  svarüpa-
dharma , the true nature of the self, awakens. When that state
of the self is in contact with the material energy, it is called25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  6 378
ätma-guëa-vikära  (the transformation of the constitutional
functions of ones self). If perverse transformations are re-moved, then änanda , which is an intrinsic characteristic of
the ätmä , will awaken. This is the opinion of Pataïjali.
Änanda  awakens when one is free from any perversion
by the guëas  and is of a blissful nature. It is the supreme end
of yoga. Later, it will be explained that this and nothing else
is called bhakti .
Samädhi is of two types: samprajïäta and asamprajïäta .
Samprajïäta-samädhi has many divisions such as sa-vitarka (ar-
gument) and sa-vicarana (philosophical research). But
asamprajïäta-samädhi is only of one type. In the state of
asamprajïata-samädhi , one attains eternal bliss, which is devoid
of any contact of the senses with their sense objects through theintelligence which has become qualified to experience the true
self or has become one with the self. In that pure state of realising
eternal bliss within the self, the mind of the yogé does not deviate
from the Absolute Reality. Without attaining this state, the jéva
can never achieve eternal auspiciousness merely by the practiceof añöäìga-yoga. This is because, if the yogé is deprived of this
blissful state, then the secondary results of this practice in theform of mystic powers and so on attract his mind, and will devi-
ate him from the topmost objective which is samädhi-sukha (bliss
in trance). Due to such obstacles, there is the danger of many
inauspicious mishaps in the practice of this añöäìga-yoga such as
degradation and deviation . In bhakti-yoga , however, there is no
such danger. This will be explained later on.
The yogé does not consider any other bliss to be superior
to the bliss achieved in samädhi . In other words, while main-
taining his life, he experiences temporary happiness throughcontact of the senses with their sense objects, but he consid-
ers this to be completely insignificant. Even at the time of
death, while tolerating the extreme pain of an accident or
bodily miseries, he enjoys the bliss of samädhi , which is theÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !379
only object of his search. Being unmoved by all these pains,
he still does not give up his supremely blissful state. He un-
derstands that these miseries will not stay for long and will
disappear soon enough. If there is a delay or any obstacle in
achieving the result of yoga, he does not become so frustrated
that he gives up his practice. With great endeavour he con-
tinues his yoga practice until he attains the result.
The first duty on the path of yoga is to follow yama ,
niyama , äsana , präëäyäma  and so on and to completely aban-
don desires which are born from the attraction to attaining
mystic siddhis.  In addition, with the help of the purified mind,
the yogé should control his senses. He should gradually learn
renunciation with intelligence acquired from following the
limb of dhäraëä (concentrating the mind). This renuncia-
tion is called pratyähära (withdrawal of the senses from the
sense objects). He should achieve ätma-samädhi by completely
controlling his mind through the processes of dhyäna , dhäraëä
and pratyähära . In the final state, he should not think any
mundane thoughts, and should not become attached to themaintenance of his body while thinking about it. This is the
ultimate duty of the yogé.

ways: 1) according to his bhäva (vision) and 2) according

Paramätmä in all jévas and all jévas in Paramätmä. His

The various living entities have different types of bod-
ies which are classified as moving and non-moving. The
jévas within these bodies are also different. Consequently,
there are unlimited jévas . In Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (5.9)
it is said:
bälägra-çata-bhägasya / çatadhä kalpitasya ca
bhägo jévaù sa vijïeyaù / sa cänantyäya kalpate
Although the jéva is situated in the inert body, he is a subtle and
non-material reality. One may divide the tip of a hair into onehundred parts and further divide one of those parts into anotherhundred, but the jéva is even smaller and more subtle than that.
The jéva, being extremely subtle, is an anti-material entity,
and is capable of acquiring the nature of änantya . Anta
means death, and freedom from death is called änantya or
mokña. Paramätmä, although one, dwells within the hearts
of the unlimited jévas as Antaryämé and as a witness. This
is also stated in the småti-çästra :
eka eva paro viñëuù / sarva-vyäpé na saàçayaù
aiçvaryäd rüpam ekaà ca / sürya-vat bahudheyate
The all-pervading Çré Viñëu is one, and by the influence of His
aiçvarya He appears in various forms, just as the one sun appears
in many places at the same time.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, Meditation on the four-
handed form of Çré Viñëu (Éçvara) is recommended to the yogé
during the sädhana stage, culminating in the realisation of My
sac-cid-änanda form of Çyämasundara in nirvikalpa -samädhi
(a state of trance). In this state, ones intellect becomes freefrom the dualities of time in regard to parama-tattva.  In other
words, one becomes free from the misconception that He isdifferent in the sädhana-avasthä (practice stage) and siddha-31! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  6 386
avasthä (perfected stage). The yogés  who worship Me, who am
all-pervading, perform bhakti unto Me by çravaëam and
kértanam.  Even in their working stage ( karma-avasthä ), their
period of deliberation ( jïäna-avasthä ) and their  meditation
(samädhi ), in all circumstances they always dwell in Me. This
means they attain kåñëa-sämépya-mokña , liberation charac-
terised by the symptom of always being situated near Kåñëa.
In Çré Närada-païcarätra , which gives instructions on yoga,
it is said:
dik-kälädy-anavacchinne / kåñëe ceto vidhäya ca
tan-mayo bhavati kñipraà / jévo brahmaëi yojayet
When the jéva fixes his mind on the form of parabrahma  Çré Kåñëa,
who is beyond the bounds of material time and space, and be-
comes absorbed in Him, he experiences the ecstatic bliss of tran-
scendental association with Him.
Thus, kåñëa-bhakti is certainly the supreme state of yoga-
samädhi .

It has been said that in sädhana-avasthä , yogés  are equally
disposed towards all beings. Here, this çloka beginning with
ätmaupamyena  specifically describes the primary charac-
teristic of th eir equanimity. Those equipoised yogés  appreci-
ate that just as they themselves like happiness and dislike
pain, others similarly experience happiness and pain. Theytherefore have equal vision everywhere and are the ever
well-wishers of everyone. Such yogés  are the topmost. This
is My opinion.

Even during sädhana-avasthä , yogés are endowed with
equanimity. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa assaying, I am explaining how a yogé behaves. Only he who
has equal vision towards everyone is considered to be the
topmost yogé. The word sama-dåñöi (equal vision) means
that in his dealings with others the yogé sees all jévas to be
like himself, and considers the happiness and pain of other
jévas as his own. Therefore, he is always the well-wisher of
all jévas, and acts accordingly for their eternal benefit. This
is called sama-darçana .

Arjuna said: O Madhusüdana, the yoga described
by You that is based on equanimity towards every-
one, everywhere, seems to be impermanent, due to the
restless nature of my mind.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Thinking that the equipoised symptoms described by Çré
Bhagavän are difficult to attain, Arjuna speaks this çloka be-
ginning with the words yo yam.  This yoga depends on being
equipoised in all situations, and I do not see how one can achieve
success in it, because its practice cannot be maintained at all
times. Because of the flickering nature of the mind, such prac-tice can last only for two or three days. Additionally, You have
explained equanimity by saying that one should see the happi-
ness and misery of all people of the world as ones own. This
vision may be possible toward those who are ones relatives or
those who are neutral, but such an attitude is impossible to
maintain towards ones enemies or those who are envious and
critical. I cannot see how the happiness and pain of myself,
Yudhiñöhira and Duryodhana are in reality equal. Although by
proper deliberation, one can have equal vision of the jévätmä ,
Paramätmä, the life air and senses of the self, ones enemies and
all embodied jévas, this vision is difficult to maintain for more
than two or three days because the very powerful and flickering
mind cannot be restrained merely by discrimination. Rather, it
is seen that the mind that is attached to sense enjoyment will
ultimately overpower ones discrimination.ÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !389

O Kåñëa, the mind is by nature restless, powerful,

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In the Kaöha Upaniñad  (1.3.3) it is said: ätmänaà rathinaà
viddhi çaréraà ratham eva ca. Know the ätmä to be the pas-
senger and the body to be the chariot.
It is said in the çrutis that learned paëòitas compare the
body to a chariot, the senses to furious horses, the mind to
the controller of the senses (the reins), the sense objects
(sound, form, taste, touch and smell) to the pathways, andthe intelligence to the driver. It is understood from this state-
ment that the intelligence controls the mind, but Arjuna
challenges this, saying that the powerful mind can even
overpower the intelligence. One may question how that can
be. He then replies, Just as a powerful disease may not be
affected by the medicine that has the potency to cure it,
similarly the mind, which is very powerful by nature, doesnot always accept intelligence endowed with discrimination.
Moreover, he says that the mind is very obstinate. Just as one33-34! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  6 390
cannot possibly pierce iron with a small needle, similarly it
is not possible for even subtle intelligence to pierce the mind.
The mind is like the wind, and just as it is difficult to con-
trol the mighty wind blowing in the sky, it is extremely dif-
ficult to control the mind by the process of añöäìga-yoga ,
through breath restraint.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
A story from the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam
illustrates how the process of serving Bhagavän can simply
and naturally control the most powerful and flickering mind.
Once there was a wealthy brähmaëa who lived with his
son and family members in the land of Avanti. Although he
was rich, he was extremely miserly, and would not spend even
a penny  for the pleasure of his family or community; rather,
he was always engaged in accumulating wealth. When his
children grew up, they became very perturbed by his behaviour,
and his neighbours, family members and others in the com-
munity also became opposed to him. Even the royal servants
opposed him because he did not pay his taxes. Unfortunately,
in this unfavourable situation, his house burnt down, andhis family and community members rejected him.
However, due to some good saàskära and the influence of
sädhu-sanga , he accepted the dress of a tridaëòi-sannyäsé . On
the instruction of his sad-guru he engaged in bhakti , and
adopted equal vision towards friends and enemies, happiness
and misery, good and bad, and towards himself and others.
He remained satisfied even when the people of his own vil-
lage mistreated him as he was begging. They would call him
an atheist and a cheater and they would throw stool and urine
into his begging bowl instead of food or grains. Yet with an
undisturbed citta (mind), always meditating on Bhagavän, he
finally attained eternal sevä to Bhagavän Mukunda.ÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !391

Arjuna is raising a question. What happens to a person
who has deviated from the paths of karma  and yoga? In other
words, what happens to a person who has given up the pathof karma and has also not attained perfection in the path

that has separated from a cloud mass and dissolves into thinair, because it does not join other clouds? When he beginsthe path of yoga, he has the desire to give up sense enjoy-
ment, but at the same time, because his vairägya  is not com-
plete, the desire to enjoy the senses still remains within him.This is a very difficult situation. Since he has abandonedthe path of karma  (a means to attain Svarga), his next world,
Svarga, is also lost, and by not attaining perfection in yoga,
which is the means for mokña , he also fails to achieve  mokña .
From this it appears that he is lost in both worlds. That iswhy I am asking You whether a person who has deviated fromthe sädhana  of attaining brahma  becomes bereft of all shel-

In this world as well as in the next world, such an unsuc-
cessful yogé engages in yoga which leads to auspiciousness.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
By addressing Arjuna as Pärtha in this çloka , Çré Bhagavän
is instructing him in a very loving manner. Bhagavän
considers Arjuna to be extremely dear to Him. By using the
word täta, which literally means son, He demonstrates His
affection for Arjuna. A father expands himself in the form
of his son, and therefore he is called tat. When the suffix ana
is applied to the original word tat, it becomes täta. Çré
Gurudeva also affectionately calls his disciple, who is like his
son, täta. Here, Çré Bhagavän says that those who engage in
yoga with faith never arrive at a degraded destination.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Pärtha, one who engages in the practice of yoga never meets
destruction, either now or in the future. The performer of
that yoga which leads to eternal good can never be subject
to an evil fate. Basically, all of humanity is divided into two
categories: righteous (regulated) and unrighteous (unregulated).The behaviour of unregulated people is always like that of
animals, whether they are cultured or uncultured, dull or in-
telligent, weak or strong. There is no possibility of the world
receiving any good from their activities.
The righteous  (regulated) can be divided into three cat-
egories: karmé , jïäné and bhakta . Karmés are further divided
into two divisions: sakäma-karmé and niñkäma-karmé . The
sakäma-karmés hanker for petty kinds of happiness, or tem-
porary pleasures. Although they attain Svarga  and worldly
progress, all their pleasure is temporary. Therefore, that
which is called kalyäëa (auspiciousness for the jévas ) is
unknown to them. The state of kalyäëa for the  jévas  is to
become free from the grip of worldliness and to attain40! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  6 398
nityänanda , eternal bliss. Therefore any process which does
not lead to this eternal bliss is futile. Only when the pur-pose of achieving this nityänanda  is combined with karma-
käëòa activities, can such  karma be called karma-yoga . First,
the citta is purified by such karma -yoga , then one attains
jïäna. After that, one engages in dhyäna-yoga (meditation)
and then finally, the zenith of all processes, the path of
bhakti-yoga is attained.
The injunction of accepting austerities by renouncing self-
ish pleasures in sakäma-karma  is called tapasyä  by a karmé .
However many austerities he may perform, his goal is onlysense pleasure and nothing else. The asuras , after achieving
the results of their austerities, simply enjoy their senses. Onthe other hand, when that persons karma surpasses the
boundaries of sense enjoyment, then niñkäma-karma-yoga
appears, which aims at the eternal good of the jéva. A dhyäna -
yogé or a jïäna -yogé, firmly situated on the path of niñkäma-
karma-yoga , often naturally performs actions for the eter-
nal good of all beings.
In every respect an añöäìga-yogé surpasses whatever results
a jéva attains by sakäma-karma .

One who deviates from the path of yoga after practising for only a

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
What is the destination of persons who deviate from the
path of yoga? In answer to this, Çré Bhagavän says that they
reside on the planets which are attained by the pious per-sons, who perform yajïas such as the açvamedha-yajïa . Since
enjoyment and mokña  are both the results of yoga, the yogés
who have not yet matured and have fallen because of a de-sire to enjoy only attain enjoyment. On the other hand, sinceit is impossible for matured yogés to desire enjoyment, they
certainly attain mokña . If, by the will of providence, a ma-
ture yogé does develop a desire to enjoy, he also can attain
enjoyment like Kardama and Saubhari Åñis.
The word çuci means those who are of good character and
conduct, and çré means wealthy business people or royalty.
A fallen yogé takes birth only in the houses of such families
after residing in Svarga and other higher planets.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The yogés  who have fallen from the path of añöäìga-yoga
can be divided into two categories. In the first category arethose who have fallen after following the process of yoga for
a short time. Such yogés  do not attain lower destinations
according to the çloka: nehäbhikrama-näço sti  (Gétä  
2.40);
rather, they enjoy happiness on the higher planets attainedby pious persons who perform yajïas  such as the açvamedha
yajïa.  They then take birth in the houses of qualified
brähmaëas or rich men who are engaged in dharmika  activi-
ties. Both of these situations are favourable for their contin-ued practice of yoga.
In the second category are those who have practised yoga41! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  6 400
for a long time and whose practice has almost matured. By
the will of providence, however, they have developed a de-sire to enjoy sense gratification in this life. In their next lifesome of them achieve their desired enjoyment and finallybecoming indifferent to that, they complete their process ofyoga . Examples of this are Kardama ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam
3.23) and Saubhari Åñis. Kardama Åñi was a yogé of high
calibre. On the order and inspiration of his father Brahmä,he unwillingly married Devahüté and enjoyed conjugal plea-sure superior to that of the Prajäpatis. Kapiladeva, an avatära
of Bhagavän, appeared as Kardama Åñis son, and, after re-nouncing all material enjoyment and sense pleasure, againengaged in the worship of Bhagavän. The life history ofSaubhari Åñi has been related in the Särärtha-varñiëé

In both of these births, due to saàskäras resulting from
yoga practice in their previous birth, the fallen yogé at-
tains intelligence which is fixed in his own dharmika
principles and also knowledge related to Paramätmä.After attaining purity of heart in a natural way, he be-gins to endeavour seriously for perfection in yoga, like one
who has awoken from sleep. Now he cannot be checkedby any obstacle. That is why such a yogé neither attains
a degraded destination nor becomes lost.

According to Gétä  (6.37), one falls from the path of yoga
because he is negligent in his endeavour. For such a fallen
yogé, the path of yoga is attained in his next life, but perfec-
tion is not. He will attain perfection in as many lives as it
takes him to become mature. He who never weakens in his
endeavour does not fall from the path. Rather, after many
births, he becomes mature in yoga and attains perfection.

It is for this reason that Bhagavän speaks this çloka ,
prayatnäd yatamänas tu , which means endeavouring harder
than before. The word tu shows a difference between these
persons and those previously mentioned who fall from yoga.
Saàçuddha-kilbiñaù indicates that even a person whose im-
purities have been completely removed cannot attain
saàsiddhi or mokña in one life.

Which is superior among karma , jïäna , and yoga ? In
answer to this, Çré Bhagavän says that a jïäné (one who
worships brahma ) is superior to an ascetic ( tapasvé ), or oneÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !405
who is devoted to performing severe austerities such as
cändräyaëa-vrata and superior to such a jïäné is a yogé (wor-
shipper of Paramätmä). This is My opinion. If a yogé is
superior to a jïäné , then what can be said about his superi-
ority over a karmé (fruitive worker)?
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Generally, it is thought that a karmé , jïäné , tapasvé , yogé
and bhakta are all equal. In this present çloka , Çré Bhagavän
is giving His definite opinion that they are not equal; rather,
there is a gradation. A niñkäma-karma-yogé  is superior to a
sakäma-karmé (tapasvé ) and a jïäné is superior again . An
añöäìga-yogé is superior to a jïäné , and a bhakti -yogé is supe-

and He speaks this çloka beginning with yoginäm . The word
yoginäm  is in the sixth case, but actually it is to be taken in
the fifth case. In the previous çloka the words tapasvibhyo
jïänibhyo dhikaù are in the fifth case. Similarly, it should
also be understood here as yogébhyah , the bhakta  is even su-
perior to the yogé. My bhakta  is not superior to only one type
of yogé, but to all types, whether they are yogarüòha , situ-
ated in samprajïäta-samädhi , or situated in asamprajïäta-
samädhi .
The import of the word yoga is that it is the means to karma ,
jïäna , tapa , bhakti  and so on. Among such yogés , those who
worship Me with bhakti  are My devotees and are the best of
sädhakas .
Karmés , tapasvés , and jïänés  are also accepted as yogés ,
but an añöäìga-yogé  is superior to them. A bhakti-yogé
however, who is engaged in hearing and chanting aboutMe, is the topmost. As it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(6.14.5):

person who is devoted to Çré Näräyaëa is most rare.
In the next eight chapters, bhakti-yoga will be delineated.
This çloka , which is the sütra of those chapters, is like an
ornament adorning the necks of the bhaktas . In the First
Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä , the crest jewel of all çästra , an
outline of the text has been given. In the Second, Third andFourth Chapters, niñkäma-karma is explained. In the Fifth
Chapter jïäna  has been described and the Sixth Chapter
describes yoga. These six chapters, however, primarily describe
karma (action).ÇLOKA DHYÄNA -YOGA !407

by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura , on the Sixth Chapter of
Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä , which gives pleasure to the bhaktas
and is accepted by all saintly persons.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
At the end of this chapter Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa has cat-
egorically stated that a bhakti-yogé is superior to all other
yogés . Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura gives a special explana-
tion of this çloka  as follows:
Amongst all types of yogés , the practitioner of bhakti-yoga
is superior. One who performs My bhajana  with faith is the
best of yogés . Amongst righteous, regulated human beings, the
niñkäma-karmé , the jïäné , the añöäìga-yogé  and the practitio-
ner of bhakti-yoga are all yogés , whereas the sakäma-karmé is
not. In fact, yoga is one, not two. Yoga  is a progressive path on
which there are various steps. Taking shelter of this path, thejéva situates himself on the path of brahma  realisation.
Niñkäma-karma-yoga  is the first step. When jïäna  and vairägya
are added, it becomes jïäna-yoga , which is the second step.
When dhyäna , in the form of meditation on Éçvara, is added
to jïäna-yoga , it is called añöäìga-yoga , the third step. And
when préti, affection for Bhagavän, is added to this third step
of añöäìga-yoga , then that is bhakti-yoga , the fourth step. All
these steps combined together constitute the one staircasecalled yoga. In order to explain this yoga clearly, all other par-
tial types of yoga have been delineated. One who desires eter-
nal auspiciousness takes exclusive shelter of yoga. As he gradu-
ally progresses on this ladder, he first becomes steady on thestep he is on, then he rises to the next step. But one who clingsto a particular step, having only established himself in thattype of yoga, is known by the name of that particular yoga.
Therefore, one is known as a karma -yogé, one as a jïäna -yogé,
one as an añöäìga-yogé  and another as a bhakti-yogé .47! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  6 408
Therefore, O Pärtha, one whose supreme objective is only
to perform bhakti  unto Me is the topmost among all the yogés .
You should become that type of yogé, namely, you should
become a bhakti-yogé .

This Seventh Chapter describes the vibhütis (opulences) of
Çré Kåñëa, who is the supreme object of worship. There is alsoa description of the four types of worshippers who performbhajana  to Him and the four types of persons who do not.
The first six chapters describe the processes of jïäna  and
yoga , which both result in mokña  and initially depend on
niñkäma-karma  to purify the heart. Now, in the next set of
six chapters, there is a description of various types of bhakti-
yoga beginning with bhakti  mixed with karma , jïäna  and so
on. These practices ( çravaëa  etc.) result in destinations (types
of liberations) such as sälokya , and are attained by the
sädhakas  of niñkäma  and sakäma-upäsana.  Most prominently,
there is a description of the process of bhakti-yoga  which is
independent of karma , jïäna , etc., and grants that mukti in
which one becomes a loving associate of Çré Kåñëa. As it issaid in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.20.32-33):
yat karmabhir yat tapasä / jïäna vairägyataç ca yat
Simply by practising bhakti-yoga , My bhakta  easily attains in full
whatever auspicious results can be achieved by performing karma
(prescribed duties), tapasyä and other auspicious activities, and
by cultivating jïäna , vairägya , yoga and däna (charitable acts).
Even if one desires the destinations of Svarga, mokña , or
Vaikuëöha, one can attain them easily by bhakti-yoga . It is
clear from these statements that bhakti  is supremely inde-
pendent. Bhakti is quite capable of granting the fruits of those
processes even if one does not perform them. This bhakti-
yoga is easy to perform, but difficult to attain.ÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !411 1
It is said in Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.8): tam eva vidit-
vätimåtyum eti. One can transcend death when one knows
Him (Parameçvara). This statement may cause one to doubtwhether one can attain mokña  merely by bhakti , without
having jïäna.  In response Çré Bhagavän says, Do not raise
such an objection. T am eva , one can only transcend death
by knowing tat-padärtha (Paramätmä), through direct real-
isation of Him. One cannot attain freedom from deathmerely by  knowing tvaà-padärtha  (the jévätmä ), prakåti  (ma-
terial nature) or any other entity. This is the import of theabove statement in Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad .
The only way to taste sugar candy is with the tongue, not
with the eyes or ears. Similarly, bhakti  is the only way to
realise parabrahma . Brahma  is guëätéta  (beyond the guëas ),
so it is only possible to attain brahma  with the help of bhakti
as bhakti  is also guëätéta . Ätma-jïäna , knowledge of the self
which is free from identification with the body and so forth,
is in sattva-guëa , so it cannot enable one to attain brahma .
Bhaktyäham ekayä grahyaù. I am attained only by
aikäntika-bhakti . (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.14.21). Bhaktyä
mäm abhijänäti (Gétä 18.55). Only by bhakti  can the jéva
specifically know the tattva  of My svarüpa  and sva-bhäva .
Çré Bhagavän says, I will establish My saviçeña  (specific
nature) by these two statements.
Jïäna  and yoga  are well known as the means to attain
mukti , but this is only possible by the influence of guëébhütä
bhakti (bhakti  predominated by karma , jïäna , tapasyä  and
so on). Jïäna  and yoga are incapable of giving such a result
when they are bereft of bhakti . There are many statements
that establish that jïäna  and yoga are ineffective without
bhakti . Moreover, in the above statement from Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad , the word eva (only) has been used before the word
viditvä  (knowing). This means that it is not a fact that mokña! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 412
is attained only by jïäna . It implies that it is possible to
attain mokña  by knowing Paramätmä, and sometimes even
without knowing Him. Thus mokña  is attained by nirguëa -
paramätma -jïäna (knowledge of Paramätmä which is beyond
the modes)  generated from bhakti , and sometimes mokña  can
be attained solely by bhakti , even without knowledge of
Paramätmä. This meaning is also conveyed by the Upaniñad
statement previously quoted.
The tongue cannot taste the sweetness of miçri (rock sugar)
if it is affected by the disease of jaundice, but by continu-ously consuming miçri , the defect of the tongue will be cured,
and the taste of miçri will be relished again. There is no doubt
about it. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.47.59) Çré Uddhava says,
Nectar always grants immortality, even if one tastes it with-out knowing its characteristics. Similarly, one may be igno-rant of His svarüpa , but if he constantly performs bhajana
of Çré Kåñëa, he is granted his desired result. It is also said of
Çré Näräyaëa in the Mokña-dharma , A person who has taken
shelter of Çré Näräyaëa does not need to perform the sädhana
by which one attains the four goals of life: dharma , artha ,
käma  and mokña . Indeed, he attains these goals, even with-
out practising this sädhana . It is also said in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam (11.20.32-33): Whatever is achieved by follow-
ing these processes or performing ones prescribed duty andausterities, My bhaktas  attain easily by bhakti-yoga . Moreover,
it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (6.16.44): Simply by hearing
Your holy name once, even a low born caëòäla is liberated from
the material world. These statements establish that, one canonly attain mokña  by practising bhakti . Furthermore: Of all
yogés , the best is he who performs bhajana  with great faith
within his heart, ( Gétä 6.47). By this statement, Çré Bhagavän
also indicates a special characteristic of His bhaktas  whose minds
are fixed in Him, and who have faith in His bhaktas . One mayÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !413
raise the question, What type of bhaktas  are eligible to have
jïäna  and vijïäna  of Çré Bhagavän? This çloka  beginning
with the words mayy äsakta , and also the next çloka , are
spoken in response to this question.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.42) states: Just as a person has
experience of satisfaction, nourishment and the removal ofhunger all at the same time when he eats food, similarly onewho performs bhajana of Çré Bhagavän simultaneously
achieves devotion, realisation of Bhagavän and detachment.
It is noteworthy that one who eats only one mouthful of
food experiences neither satisfaction nor nourishment. Sat-isfaction and nourishment are experienced only by one whoeats a full meal. In the same way, although one starts to re-alise Me from the initial stages of performing My bhajana ,
only one who has become situated on the platform of äsakti ,
and whose mind is attached to My Çyämasundara svarüpa ,
adorned with a yellow dress, realises Me in reality. You can
know Me only in this way.
Please hear how one can have direct realisation of Me and
what type of yoga grants this. One can become My ananya-
bhakta  even without the help of jïäna , karma , etc. by gradu-
ally becoming united with Me, and eventually taking com-plete shelter of Me. 
In this çloka , the word asaàçayaà indicates a doubt about
the possibility of attaining nirviçeña-brahma , and samagram
indicates that the realisation of that svarüpa is incomplete.
This will be stated later on in Gétä (12.5):
kleço dhikataras teñäm / avyaktäsakta-cetasäm
avyaktä hi gatir duhkhaà / dehavadbhir aväpyate
Those who fix their mind on nirguëa-brahma  have to undergo
great miseries. It may be difficult for an embodied jéva to attain
that unmanifest nature.1! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 414
In other words, there is a doubt as to whether one can at-
tain the nirviçeña-brahma-svarüpa. However, in the present
çloka Çré Bhagavän is declaring, This doubt does not exist
in relation to My bhakti-yoga , because My  devotees  always
realise Me, Çré Kåñëa, parabrahma -tattva.  Moreover,
brahma , the worshipable object of the jïänés , is only My
glorious effulgence. As I said to King Satyavrata in MyMatsya  avatära , By following My instructions you will
also come to know My glories, which are manifested inyour heart by  çabda-brahma , the sound representation of
parabrahma , (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  8.24.38). And in Gétä
(14.27) I have said: I am the shelter or basis of nirviçeña-
brahma . Therefore, knowledge of My nirviçeña-svarüpa is
not complete but only partial compared to knowledge ofMy Çré Kåñëa Çyämasundara pétämbara-dhäré svarüpa.
Knowledge of nirviçeña-brahma  is asamagram (incom-
plete).

The knowledge of nirviçeña-brahma  is incomplete be-

because it merely transcends physical and mental knowl-

Until one is situated on the platform of äsakti  (attach-

through  vijïäna . Please hear about both of these, after know-

When one performs nirguëä-bhakti , he realises the com-
plete svarüpa  of Svayaà Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, who is eter-
nal, full of knowledge and bliss, and who is the basis of tran-
scendental aiçvarya and mädhurya . Çré Vyäsa attained com-
plete vision and realisation of the svarüpa  of Bhagavän in a
state of samädhi , only through bhakti-yoga . Apaçyat purusaà
pürëam (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.7.4). And thus he saw the
complete Personality of Godhead. It should be understoodthat both brahma -jïäna  and paramätma -jïäna  are included
within this complete vision and realisation ( vijïäna ) of
Kåñëas svarüpa . Therefore, when one has attained knowl-
edge of Çré Bhagavän, nothing else remains to be known.
The synonym for nirguëa-bhakti  is prema-bhakti . To at-
tain prema-bhakti , one must pass through nine stages: (1)
çraddhä , (2)  sädhu-saìga , (3) bhajana -kriyä , (4)  anartha-
nivåtti , (5) niñöhä , (6) ruci, (7) äsakti (these seven stages com-
prise sädhana -bhakti ), (8) bhäva  and (9) the appearance of
prema . Before the sädhaka bhakta  achieves the stage of äsakti ,
knowledge of Bhagavän is aiçvarya-mayé . But when äsakti
becomes mature, he realises mädhurya within his heart. This
is called vijïäna.

Among thousands of men, one may endeavour for
perfection. And among those who attain perfection,it is rare for even one to know My 
svarüpa  in truth.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Even jïänés  and yogés who are endowed with the
symptoms described in the previous six chapters rarelyattain  knowledge of Me complete with vijïäna . Saying
this, Çré Bhagavän speaks about vijïäna  (realisation of
Him) in this çloka  beginning with the word manuñyänäm .
Among countless jévas , one becomes a human being, and
among thousands of humans one of them tries to attainthe ultimate goal of life. Among thousands who makesuch an endeavour, it is rare for one to know in truth andto have direct realisation of My ÇyämasundaraMuralédhäré form.
The conclusion is that the bliss one experiences by real-
isation of saviçeña-brahma  is thousands of times greater than
the bliss experienced by realizing nirviçeña-brahma .

In this çloka , Bhagavän is showing that bhagavat-jïäna  is
extremely rare. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (6.14.5), this has been
described:
muktänäm api siddhänäà / näräyaëa-paräyaëaù
sudurlabhaù praçäntätmä / koöiñv api mahä-mune
O Mahä-muni, among millions of such liberated and perfected
persons, a bhakta  of Näräyaëa, who is very peaceful, is extremely
rare. Even more rare than such aiçvarya-mayé bhaktas  of Çré
Näräyaëa, who are attracted to His majesty, are the mädhurya-
paräyaëa-bhaktas  of Çré Kåñëa. The bliss derived from tasting the
sweetness  of Çré Kåñëa is millions of times greater than  the
brahmänanda , the bliss of brahma .3! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 418
 Also in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.25:
brahmänando bhaved eñaù cet parärdha-guëé-kåtaù
naiti bhakti-sukhämbhodheù paramäëu-tuläm api
Even when the bliss of brahma  is multiplied by the number of
days in Brahmäs lifespan, it still cannot be compared to a singleparticle of the pleasure of tasting the mellows of Çré Kåñëassweetness.
This is also stated in Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi-lélä  7.84-85).

In relation to bhakti , the word jïäna  indicates only the
aiçvarya-jïäna  of Çré Bhagavän. It does not indicate ätma -
jïäna.  Hence, in this çloka  beginning with the word bhümi
and in the next  çloka , He is delineating His aiçvarya -jïäna  by
explaining His spiritual ( parä) and material ( aparä ) energies.
The word bhümi-ädi (earth, etc.) indicates the five material
elements  (païca-mahä-bhüta ) along with their re spectiveÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !419
subtle elements such as fragrance. The word ahaìkära (false
ego) refers to their effects, the senses, and their cause, themahät -tattva . Since the intelligence and the mind are promi-
nent among these elements, they have been mentioned sepa-rately.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Knowledge of My svarüpa and My aiçvarya is called
bhagavat -jïäna . It is described in this way: I, the Supreme
Absolute Reality Çré Kåñëa, am always situated in Mysvarüpa , and possess all energies ( çaktis ) in full. Brahma  is
only a featureless ( nirviçeña ) expression of My çakti , and does
not have a form ( svarüpa ). The existence of brahma  is based
on the concept of negating the created world. Paramätmä isalso a partial manifestation of My energy in this world. Infact, He is a reality specifically related to the temporarymaterial world, and does not have an eternal svarüpa .
Bhagavat-svarüpa  is My only eternal feature and has two
types of çakti . One çakti  is called bahiraìgä or mäyä -çakti ,
the external energy. Since it is the cause (mother) of the inertworld, it is also called aparä -çakti . One should understand
the number of elements in this aparä -çakti  related to inert
matter. The five gross elements: earth, water, fire, air andether are called mahä-bhüta (gross elements). Smell, taste,
form, touch and sound are their five respective qualities.Hence, there are ten elements. You should understand thatthe senses are their active elements initiated by the elementof the false ego, or ahaìkära , and that mahät -tattva is their
cause. The mind and intelligence have been mentioned asseparate elements, because of their prominent and distinc-
tive functions among the group of elements, but in fact they
are one. This entire group is all part of My external energy.4! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 420

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Because its nature is inert, the earlier mentioned bahiraìga-
çakti  is external ( aparä ). The taöastha-çakti , in the form of
the jévas, is different from this bahiraìga-çakti  and superior
(parä) to it because of the presence of consciousness. The
reason that it is superior is that by its conscious nature itsustains the universe, that is, it accepts the material worldfor the purpose of its own enjoyment.
S

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Besides this material nature ( aparä prakåti ), there is MyÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !421
marginal nature ( taöasthä prakåti ), which is also called
jéva or parä  prakåti . That prakåti  is conscious  (caitanya-
svarüpä ), and it is in the form of the jévas (jéva-svarüpä ).
All the jévas  emanating from that energy  have made this
inert material world conscious. The jéva has the capac-
ity to understand and move in either the cit-jagat (tran-
scendental world), which has emanated from My inter-nal energy ( antaraìga-çakti ), or in the jaòa-jagat (inert
world) which has emanated from My external energy(bahiraìga-çakti ). Jéva-çakti  is also called taöastha-çakti
for this reason.
Those baddha-jévas  who are averse to Çré Kåñëa manifest
in this world from this taöastha-çakti . It is a great miscon-
ception to think that the baddha-jévas  have given up their
service to Kåñëa, and have come from Vaikuëöha or even
higher, from Goloka. This idea is opposed to siddhänta . Once
a jéva has attained service to Kåñëa in His abode, it is im-
possible for him to fall from that position. As it is said inGétä  (15.6):
yad gatvä na nivartante / tad dhäma paramaà mama
Those who attain My supreme dhäma never return to this mate-
rial world.
Citraketu Mahäräja and Jaya and Vijaya never fell down.
They appeared in this world voluntarily, and enacted theroles of baddha-jévas  for the pleasure of Bhagavän. The jévas
who are absorbed in service to Çré Kåñëa  in the spiritual
world manifest either from Çré Baladeva Prabhu, or fromHis expansion, Mahä-Saìkarñaëa, who is non-differentfrom Him. They are eternally liberated jévas . It is never
possible that they fall.6! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 422

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän says, In this way, I am the cause of every-
thing. Just as cause and effect are non-different from eachother, so are the energy and the energetic.
It is said in çruti:  ekam evädvitéyaà brahma. Before the
creation of this universe, there was only one Absolute Real-ity without a second. ( Chändogya Upaniñad 6.2.1)
Moreover:  neha nänästi kiïcana. Nothing exists except for
advaya  brahma , the one non-dual Absolute Truth in various
forms.  (Båhad-Äranyaka-Upaniñad  4.4.19)
Also in çruti it is stated: Since My çaktis are the cause of
all creations, I am the cause of everything.
In this way, after first explaining His nature of being ev-
erything, Bhagavän is now explaining His quality of beingall-pervading by the words mayi and so on. Sarvam idam
means, Both the cit (conscious) and jaòa (inert) universes
are non-different from Me because they are My creations6-7! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 424
(effects). In other words, they are My  svarüpa , and just as
jewels are strung on a thread, they are strung on Me,Antaryämé. Çré Madhusüdana Sarasvatépäda has written:sütre maëi-gaëä iva. This example merely proves that the
universe is resting in Bhagavän, but it does not prove thatHe is the cause of the universe. However, gold is the causeof a golden earring is an appropriate example to establishHim as the cause of the universe.

In the previous çloka , Çré Bhagavän established Himself as
the independent cause of creation and dissolution. Now, inthe present çloka , He is establishing that as all-pervading
Antaryämé, He alone is the cause of maintenance. I, Çré Kåñëa,am the parama-tattva  and the cause of all causes. Lord Brahmä
also establishes this principle in Brahma-saàhitä (5. 1):
éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù
anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam
The Supreme Lord, the embodiment of truth, consciousness and
joy, is Govinda Kåñëa. He is without beginning, the origin of allthat be, and the Cause of all causes.
To make this subject easier to understand, we will cite
concepts from Govinda-bhäñya  written by Çré Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa:  Parabrahma-svarüpa , Çré Kåñëa, is the Su-
preme Absolute Reality ( para-tattva-vastu ). There is noth-
ing superior to Him because there is no other independententity. Yasmät paraà nä param asti kiïcit (Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad 3.9). These statements from the çrutis  have not
accepted the existence of anything higher than the all-worshipable brahma . In the Vedas  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad
3.8-9) it is said: I have known this effulgent brahma
which is like the sun and beyond all darkness (ignorance).ÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !425
One at tains immortality and the goal of human life
(puruñärtha)  by knowing Him. The only means to attain
immortality is by knowledge of this mahä-puruña . There is
nothing superior to Him.
After accepting the superiority of parabrahma  established
in these mantras , it is further said: Those who know the pure
or constitutional nature of brahma  attain immortality in due
course of time; otherwise there is no cessation to their mis-eries. If something is accepted as superior to brahma , then
Çré Kåñëas statement: mattaù parataraà nänyat kiïcid asti
dhanaïjaya , becomes false Govinda-bhäñya (Brahma-sütra
3.2.37).
Çvetäsvatara Upaniñad (6.8) repeats the same: na tat-samaç
cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate. There is nothing equal to or greater
than saviçeña-brahma -tattva .

devas (the jévas), who are divine by nature, but who are ab-
sorbed in the sporting pleasures of sense enjoyment. Thismäyä  is guëa -mayé , composed of the three guëas . The word
guëa -mayé  has another meaning. It has the form of a strong
rope with three strands. This bahiraìga-çakti  which belongs
to Me, Parameçvara, is duratyayä , extremely difficult to cross
over. No one is able to cut this rope and become free fromthe bondage of the guëas . Çré Bhagavän says, Believe Me.
Then He touches His own chest, and goes on to say mäm ,
A person can only transcend this mäyä  if he exclusively
surrenders unto Me in this form of Çyämasundara.

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Parä  (spiritual) and aparä (material) are Bhagaväns two
types of çaktis . The spiritual, internal energy is called
antaraìgä (cit-çakti ) and the material, external energy is
called bahiraìgä  (acit, aparä or mäyä -çakti ). In the Upaniñads
it is also said: mäyän tu prakåtià vidyän mayinaà tu
maheçvaram. Mäyä should be understood as aparä-çakti , and
the person ( puruña ) who is the shelter of mäyä , should be
understood to be the maheçvara , the Supreme Controller.
(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  4.10)
This is also confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (8.5.30): na
yasya kaçcätititarti mäyäà / yayä jano muhyati veda närtham. 
The jéva is bewildered by mäyä -çakti and therefore he is unable
to understand the nature of the self. This insurmountablemäyä  of Bhagavän cannot be overcome by anyone without
His mercy.14! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 432
One may question that if mäyä -çakti  is the cause of the jévas
bondage, can one become free from this bondage by pleasingthis mäyä -çakti ? What is the need to take shelter of Çré Hari,
Guru and the Vaiñëavas? In the present çloka , Bhagavän re-
sponds to this, using the words mama  mäyä.  He says, This
mäyä  is not independent, rather, it is under My control, so it
has no independence to liberate anyone from the materialworld. This is what He means by the statement: mäm eva ye
prapadyante.  Only a person who surrenders to Me can cross
over this insurmountable mäyä  of Mine; others cannot.
This is also confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.14.58):
samäçritä ye pada-pallava-plavaà
mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù
bhavämbudhir vatsa-padaà paraà padaà
padaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm
When a person takes shelter of the boat of the lotus feet of Çré
Kåñëa, who is supremely famous and is the shelter of great per-sonalities such as Çiva and Brahmä, this ocean of the materialworld becomes just like the water contained in the hoof-printof a calf. His supreme destination is then Vaikuëöha, which isfree from all types of miseries.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
If the question is raised, Why, then, do the paëòitas  not
take shelter of You? Çré Bhagavän replies, Those who aregenuine paëòitas  do take exclusive shelter of Me, but those
who like to consider themselves to be paëòitas do not. Çré
Bhagavän is speaking this çloka  beginning with the words
na mäm to explain this. The word duñkåtinaù  refers to those
who are wicked, though they may have some piety. And somemay appear to be paëòitas  but are actually kupaëòitas (pseudo
paëòitas ). They are of four types:
(1)Müòhäù a fruitive worker (a karmé ), who is no better
than an animal. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.32.19) describes, Just
as a stool-eating hog rejects sweet-rice and enjoys stool, thosecheated by destiny, who give up the nectar of hearing hari-
kathä and engage in hearing other useless talks, are most un-
fortunate. Who but an animal would not like to performsevä to Çré Mukunda?
(2)Narädhama the lowest among mankind. Even after
performing bhakti  for some time and attaining the qualities
of a human being, they finally give up the process of bhakti
wilfully, thinking that it is not effective in attaining the de-sired fruit. Such persons are narädhamas.
(3)Mäyayäpahåta-jïäna those whose knowledge has been
stolen by mäyä , even after studying the çästra . They think
that only the form of Çré Näräyaëa, situated in Vaikuëöha,
can be served eternally and can grant eternal bhakti ; one
cannot perform bhakti  eternally to other forms, such as Räma15! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 434
and Kåñëa, because They are human-like. Çré Bhagavän has
said in the Gétä (9.11): Fools disrespect Me when I appear in
My human form. After apparently surrendering unto Me, theyhave not surrendered in reality.
(4)Äsuraà bhävam äçritäù   Asuras  such as
Jaräsandha shoot arrows in order to hurt My transcen-dental body. Similarly, persons who carry this äsurika
bhäva  use illogical reasoning to deny My çré-vigraha (De-

O best of the Bharata dynasty, there are four types
of pious men who perform My bhajana ; the distressed
(ärtta ), the inquisitive ( jijïäsu ), the seeker of wealth
(arthärthé ) and the man of wisdom  (jïäné ).
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Who then performs Your bhajana ? In response to this
question, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the
words catur-vidhä . Sukåta  refers to those who worship Me
and who follow the rules and regulations of varëäçrama-
dharma.  Ärtta  refers to persons afflicted with distress such
as disease and who worship Me to get relief. Jijïäsu  means
those who worship Me desiring ätma-jïäna (knowledge of
the self) or scholarly knowledge of the çästra through gram-
mar. Arthärthé  refers to those who worship Me with a desire
for enjoyment in this world, such as possession of land, el-ephants, horses, beautiful women, gold, or enjoyment inSvarga. Jïänés  with pure hearts also worship Me. Of these
four, the first three are sakäma -gåhasthas , householders who
have fruitive desires, and the fourth group consists of niñkäma -
sannyäsés  (renunciates who perform selfless actions).16! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 436
These four types of persons are eligible to perform pradhäné-
bhütä bhakti , the process wherein bhakti  predominates over
karma , jïäna , etc. The first three perform karma -miçrä
bhakti , bhakti  mixed with karma , and the fourth performs
jïäna -miçrä bhakti , bhakti  mixed with jïäna . Later, in the
çloka : sarva-dväräëi samyamya (Gétä 8.12.), yoga-miçrä  bhakti
will be explained. However, kevala-bhakti , which is devoid
of karma  or jïäna , is explained in the beginning of the Sev-
enth Chapter: mayy äsakta-manäù pärtha (Gétä 7.1). Kevala-
bhakti  will also be delineated later in two çlokas : ananya-
cetäh satatam  (Gétä  8.14) and mahätmänas tu mäà pärtha
(Gétä 9.13).
In the middle six chapters of Gétä , Çré Bhagavän has ex-
plained two types of bhakti : pradhäné -bhütä  and kevalä. In
the third process, which is called guëébhütä bhakti , bhakti  is
present to some extent but it is predominated by karma , jïäna
and so forth. This is the process that karmés , jïänés and yogés
perform simply to attain perfection in their respective
endeavours. It cannot be called bhakti because it is karma or
jïäna , etc., which predominate, and not bhakti  herself.
Prädhänyena vyapadeçä bhavanti is a name given to some-
thing according to its predominating element. According tothis principle of logic ( nyäya ), such processes are named af-
ter their respective predominating natures:  karma , jïäna  and
yoga.  These processes are not categorised as bhakti because
bhakti  is not predominant.
The result of sakäma -karma  is Svarga, and the result of
niñkäma -karma  is jïäna . The result of jïäna  and yoga  is
mokña . Now, the result of the two types of bhakti , pradhäné-
bhütä  and kevalä , are being explained. In pradhäné-bhütä
bhakti , those who are distressed ( ärtta ), those who aspire for
knowledge ( jijïäsu ) and those who seek wealth  (arthärthé )
perform karma -miçrä  bhakti , that is, bhakti  which is mixed
with karma.  Hence they are called sakäma -bhaktas.  The onlyÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !437
result of this type of bhakti is the fulfilment of ones mate-
rial desires. Due to the superior nature of the object of theirendeavour ( bhakti ), they finally attain mokña , e.g. sälokya ,
which is characterised by a predominance of happiness andmajesty ( aiçvarya ). They do not fall down, like a karmé  who
falls after enjoying in Svarga. This is stated later on: yänti
mad-yäjino pi mäm  (Gétä  9.25).
The result of the fourth type, jïäna -miçrä bhakti , is supe-
rior to that of karma -miçrä bhakti . Those who practise it
attain çänta-rati , like the four Kumäras, headed by Sanaka.
By the special mercy of Çré Bhagavän and His bhaktas , this
type of bhakti  culminates in premotkarña , the excellence of
prema , which is seen in people like Çukadeva Gosvämi.
When karma -miçrä bhakti  is niñkäma  (selfless), it results in
jïäna -miçrä bhakti , the result of which has just been ex-
plained.
Sometimes, a person who is performing jïäna -miçrä  or
karma -miçrä bhakti  attains prema  in the moods of däsya
(servitorship) and so forth, due to his intense desire which isdeveloped by the association of bhaktas who have  däsya-
bhava , etc. That prema , however, is predominated by aiçvarya .
The result of çuddhä , ananyä , akiïcanä and uttama-bhakti ,
etc., which is free from jïäna  and karma  and which has
various branches, is that one attains the position of a lovingassociate of Kåñëa in däsya-bhäva , sakhya-bhäva  and so on.
This has been established in many places in the commen-taries of Çrémad-Bhägavatam . The concept of sädhya -bhakti
has also been briefly explained in this commentary.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Çré Kåñëa as saying, It
is generally not possible for those who are miscreants ( duñkåta )
to perform My bhajana , because they are not on the path of
gradually developing their consciousness. Sometim es, however,16! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 438
such people attain My service by chance. Among those with
sukåti who lead a regulated life, four types are qualified to
perform My bhajana . Those who are engaged in kämya -
karma  (fruitive activities) remember Me when they are af-
flicted by some misery. They are called ärtta , the distressed.
Even those who are duñkåta  sometimes remember Me when
in distress.
The foolish ( müòhaù ), who stick to morality as described
in the previous çloka , engage in the gradual process of inquir-
ing about tattva-jïäna.  By this, they feel the necessity of
accepting the existence of Parameçvara. As He is the objectof their inquisitiveness, they gradually remember Me.Narädhamas , the lowest among mankind, who take up bhakti
and then later discard it, gradually become dissatisfied withtheir concept of an ethical controller,  and come to realise the
real controller of morality. They then become regulatedbhaktas  and, since they turn to Me to fulfil their desired goals,
they are known as arthärthé.  When the jéva realises that
knowledge of brahma  and Paramätmä is incomplete, he takes
shelter of My çuddha-jïäna . At that time the covering of
mäyä  is removed and, knowing himself to be My eternal ser-
vant, he accepts My full shelter.
Those who are ärtta (distressed) have the defect of various
desires; those who are jijïäsu (inquisitive) have the defect of
bondage to moralistic knowledge; the arthärthés (seekers of
wealth) have the defect of striving to attain Svarga; and thejïänés , who think that bhagavat -tattva  is temporary, have the
defect of wanting to merge into brahma. When these impuri-
ties are removed, these four types of persons become eligibleto perform pure bhakti . As long as these impurities exist in them,
their pure bhakti  is considered to be pradhäné-bhütä . They
attain bhakti  when their impurities are completely removed .
This bhakti  is called kevalä , akiïcinä or uttamä .ÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !439
The word sukåti  used in this çloka  means piety that is gen-
erated from following the principles of varëa and äçrama .
Such pious persons, whose bhakti  is pradhäné-bhütä , engage
in Bhagaväns service in four ways.
Examples of karma pradhäné-bhütä bhakti are included in
the first three categories below:
(1)Ärtta:  Kings who were captured by Jaräsandha; and
Gajendra, who was caught by a crocodile.
(2)Jijïäsu:  Çaunaka and other åñis who were inquisitive
about ätma-jïäna .
(3)Arthärthé: Those such as Dhruva who sought wealth.
(4)Jïäné: The four Kumäras come in this category. This is
jïäna -pradhäné-bhütä  bhakti .
Pradhäné-bhütä bhakti is defined as that karma , jïäna  and
yoga in which bhakti predominates, in other words, where
karma , jïäna  and yoga are subordinate to bhakti.
Kevala-bhakti  is defined as follows:
anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà / jïäna-karmädy-anävröam
änukülyena kåñëänu-çélanam bhaktir uttamä
Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  1.1.11
Uttama -bhakti  is performed when a person is free from all other
desires except to render service to Kåñëa, when his intelligenceis completely free from the concept of nirviçeña-brahma -jïäna ,
and from affinity to nitya  (regular) and naimittika  (causal or
occasional) karma , yoga, tapasyä , etc., and when he renders ser-
vice to Kåñëa and His bhaktas  in a favourable way.
Guëé-bhütä bhakti is defined as that process in which
karma , jïäna  and yoga predominate,  not bhakti . When bhakti
is only practised to assist in the attainment of mokña  or
Svarga, then such karma  is merely called karma , jïäna  is
called jïäna , and yoga is called yoga. Such karma , jïäna  and
yoga  are not çuddha -bhakti , but guëé-bhütä bhakti . Guëé -16! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 440
bhütä bhakti  is not considered to be in the category of bhakti
because bhakti  does not predominate in it. In conclusion,
therefore, bhakti  is of two types: kevalä  and pradhäné-bhütä .
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given detailedexplanations of bhakti -tattva  in his Särärtha -darçiné  commen-
tary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam . For this information, one should
consult the following çlokas  from Çrémad-Bhägavatam :

Who is the best of the four types of devotees who are eligible
to perform bhakti ? In answer, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka
beginning with the word teñäm.  Those jïänés  who are always
united with Me are the best of the four. By the prac tice of jïäna ,
their thoughts are completely under control and thus theirÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !441
minds remain one-pointed. The other three types ( ärtta  and
so on) are not like this. Arjuna then asks, Do all jïänés
worship You  out of fear that they may fail in their endeav-
our to attain jïäna ? In response, Bhagavän says eka-bhakti .
Ekä means prominent. This means, Those jïänés  in whom
bhakti  is prominent ( pradhäné-bhütä ) perform bhajana to Me,
unlike other jïänés  in whom jïäna  is prominent . Those who
are attached only to bhakti  are bhakti -eka, and they are
jïänés  in name only.
In this way, in My beautiful form of Çyämasundara, I am
very dear to the jïänés . In the states of both sädhana  and
sädhya , they are unable to give up their attachment to this
form. It is because of the principle of surrender (as describedin Gétä  4.11) that they are also very dear to Me.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, When
they have become free from impurities, the ärtta , jijïäsu ,
arthärthé  and jïäné  become devotedly surrendered to Me and
become My bhaktas . Among them, the jïänés  attain çuddha-
jïäna , having given up the impurity of jïäna , which is the
desire for salvation . They then become endowed with bhakti-
yoga , and attain superiority over the other three types of
devotees. This means that although the process of karma
cleanses the jéva of all impurities,  the svarüpa  of the jéva,
which is conscious by nature, is not realised by the practiceof karma to the same extent that it is realised by the culti-
vation of jïäna-yoga. Ultimately, by associating submissively
with bhaktas , everyone realises his own svarüpa . During the
sädhana  stage, only jïäné -bhaktas  who are eka-bhaktir
viçiñyate  (specifically endowed with one-pointed pure devo-
tion), are superior to the other three types of eligible persons
described above. They are My unalloyed servants. Thus I amvery dear to them and they are also very dear to Me.17! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 442
Çukadeva Goswämi is an example of this. Previously, he was
a brahma-jïäné , but in the association of Çré Vyäsadeva, he
realised bhagavat -jïäna  (prema-bhakti ). During the sädhana
stage, the service to Kåñëa of those bhaktas  who have attained
pure knowledge ( çuddha-jïäna ) is also supremely pure, with-
out the slightest scent of materialism.

Does that mean that the other three types of persons, the
ärtta  and so on, are not dear to You? In response, Çré
Bhagavän says, No, no, that is not so, and speaks this çloka
beginning with udäräh . Whoever performs My bhajana with
a desire to receive something from Me, and who accepts thatbenediction when I award it to him, is dear to Me. Havinghad their desires fulfilled by Me, they give Me the quality ofbeing bhakta-vatsala (affectionate to My  bhakta ). However,ÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !443
jïäné  tv ätmaiva  refers to the jïäné  who is considered to be
My own self and extremely dear to Me, because, while per-forming My bhajana , he does not expect anything in return
from Me such as Svarga or mokña.  As a result I always re-
main under his control. He is like My own self.  This is My
opinion. Because he knows only Me, Çyämasundara, as thehighest destination, he remains free from anxiety and he isdetermined to attain Me. He does not take shelter of Mynirviçeña-svarüpa , brahma-nirväëa.
I am bhakta -vatsala Bhagavän, and I consider such a jïäné ,
who is endowed with niñkäma-pradhäné-bhütä bhakti , to be
My very self. But one who is endowed with unalloyed kevala-
bhakti is even more dear than My own self.
It is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.14.15): O Uddhava, as
a bhakta  you are so dear to Me; not even My own son Brahmä
or Çaìkara, Saìkarñaëa, Laksmé-devé or My own svarüpa  are
as dear to Me as you are. Moreover, Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(9.4.64) says: Without the associaton of My bhakta  sädhus  I
do not desire even the bliss of My own svarüpa .
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.29.42) says ätmäräma also enjoys.
This means that, although yogeçvareçvaraù Çré Kåñëa is
ätmäräma , who delights within Himself, He receives a greater
pleasure from the service of the gopés.  Thus He mercifully
enjoys and performs pastimes with them.

In his Çärärtha-darçiné  commentary on this çloka , Çréla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains the word udära-
dhéh to mean of pure and great intelligence  (su-buddhi ). Per-
formance of Bhagaväns bhajana is the symptom of pure and
great intelligence regardless of whether one has materialdesires or is free from them. The absence of such worship isa symptom of impure and lowly intelligence.
What to speak of the devotees who are free from material
desires, even those devotees who have material desires attainservice to Bhagavän in His abode, by His mercy or by themercy of His bhaktas , when they have enjoyed their desired
objective. Therefore, they possess pure and great intelligence.

After many births of spiritual practice, the jïäné  who is
endowed with knowledge that everything both conscious andinert is related to Väsudeva surrenders himself fully to Me,and performs 
bhajana  to Me. Such a mahätmä  is extremely
rare.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The following question may be raised: Since the jïänés
accept Your shelter as the supreme destination, they certainlyattain You, but how long will it take for such jïänés  to become
qualified to enter bhakti ? In answer to this, Çré Bhagavän
speaks this çloka  beginning with the word bahünäm .
Väsudevaù sarvam  means that those jïänés take shelter of Me
when, after many, many births they see Väsudeva everywhere.Such sädhus surrender unto Me due to the influence of good
association which is arranged by My will. That is, they sur-render to Me according to the bhäva  received in such associa-
tion. Among thousands and thousands of men, such a jïäné
bhakta , whose thoughts are fixed in Me is very rare, what to
speak of aikäntika -bhaktas , who are far more rare.

Of the four types of devotees ( ärtta , etc.), the jïänés  who
have niñöhä in Me, Kåñëa, are the best. A jïäné who has
spiritual fortune ( sukåti ) attains the association of çuddha
Vaiñëavas after many, many lifetimes, and he thus becomesaware of the svarüpa  of Çré Väsudeva. He sees Bhagavän
Väsudeva everywhere, which means that he sees everythingas being related to Väsudeva. Thus he obtains çuddha-bhakti
to Çré Kåñëa. Such mahätmäs  are extremely rare.
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa has given the following com-
ment on this çloka : The bhaktas who are ärtta , jijïäsu and
arthärthé  enjoy the highest type of material happiness for
many lifetimes as a result of devotion unto Me. Finally, theybecome detached from such material pleasure, and in some19! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 446

svarüpa-tattva.  In that association, they attain knowledge of
My svarüpa . Knowing only Me, Kåñëa, the son of Vasudeva,
as the parama-tattva , they take shelter of Me.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Af-
ter performing sädhana  for many, many lifetimes, the jévas
attain pure jïäna , and become steadfast in the transcenden-
tal consciousness of the self. In the beginning of such spiri-tual practice, when they are trying to give up their mundaneidentification, they take support of impersonal monism(advaita-bhäva ) to some extent. During this stage, they de-
velop disgust towards the material world, but they also re-main indifferent toward spirituality, especially regarding thevariegated nature of spiritual life. When they have becomea little advanced in the eternal, conscious existence of theself (caitanya -dharma ), and in understanding the special
nature of spiritual life which consists of variegated activi-
ties, they become attracted to it and surrender unto Me, who
am paraà caitanya-rüpa (the supreme conscious form). At
that time they understand that this mundane world is notindependent but a perverted reflection of the conscious real-ity, the transcendental realm, and that a relationship withVäsudeva also exists in this world. Hence everything is inrelationship with Väsudeva. Those mahätmäs , who have such
a surrendered attitude towards Me, are very rare.

the next three çlokas.  Those who think that the devas , such

Intelligent and fortunate persons, who are influenced by
various types of desires, try to satisfy their desires by wor-shipping Parameçvara Çré Kåñëa. When they have fulfilledtheir desires, by His mercy they gradually lose interest in suchenjoyment and attain His bhajana . In this regard, the çlokas
from Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.3.10 and 5.19.26) are worth
conte mplating.
As a result of being averse to Kåñëa, fools and unfortunate
persons remain bound by the räjasika  and tämasika guëas and
think that the devas  can fulfil their desires more quickly. They,

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Those
such as the distressed are averse to Me as long as their impu-rities remain, but when they are freed from material impuri-ties, they perform bhakti to Me. Those who take shelter of
My transcendental nature, however, do not become attractedto the external nature, even though they may be full of de-sires. I free them from all their material motivations withina short time. Conversely, those who are averse to Me lose theirspiritual intelligence and, being impelled by their materialdesires, worship particular devas  who can quickly award the
trivial objects of their desires. They do not trust Me, the eter-nal, beautiful Çyämasundara, the embodiment of viçuddha-

If Arjuna says, For the auspiciousness of their devotees,
those devatäs  will generate in them faith in Your bhakti , being

saying, No, it is not so. The devatäs  are unable to generate
faith ( çraddhä ) in devotion to themselves, so how can they
generate çraddhä  in My bhakti ? Hence, He speaks this çloka

Ihate  means he does. They attain their desired ends by

fulfilled by Me alone.

Some think that if they worship the devatäs , they will obtain
the fruits of their desires by that devatäs  mercy. But, from this
çloka  it is clear that the devas  are unable to award the results of
worship that is performed to them. Those who worship the devas
can obtain their desired results only when it is sanctioned byBhagavän, but such ignorant people cannot understand that itis Çré Bhagavän, as Antaryämé who has fulfilled their desires.Here it is seen that the devatäs  cannot generate çraddhä  in them-
selves among their own worshippers. Similarly, they cannot in-dependently award the results of fruitive activities unless
Antaryämé Çré Bhagavän sanctions it.

attains the object of ones worship. This is indeed justice. Ifthe devatäs  themselves are perishable, how will their wor-

Bhagavän Himself generates the faith in the worshipperstoward their worshipable deity, and also grants them theresult of their fruitive activities? In response to this ÇréBhagavän replies, If, being impelled by some desire, one takesshelter of the devas , he is called håta-jïäna , a person who
has lost his intelligence. Since he attains only perishableresults, he is described as having less intelligence. Someonemay say that because Bhagavän bestows eternal results to Hisbhaktas and perishable results to the worshippers of the devas ,
He is not equal to both; rather He is biased. In response onecan say that it is certainly just to receive the result that onedesires. Because both the devatäs  and their planets are tem-

sometimes descends with His eternal associates to mani-fest His nitya-lélä  out of compassion for the jévas  of this
world. Those who are unaware of this tattva  are unable to
understand this secret. They think that the unmanifest
nirviçeña-brahma  is the only para-tattva , and that
Bhagavän, whose names, forms, qualities and activities aretranscendental, has manifested Himself from that nirviçeña-25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 456
brahma . Such people are fools and have been described here
as müòhaù  because their intelligence is covered by mahä-
mäyä . Here, it should be understood that Bhagavän has two
types of mäyä-çakti : yogamäyä  (internal) and mahä-mäyä
(external). Yogamäyä  is His svarüpa-çakti (internal potency),
which is expert in making the impossible possible, and mahä-
mäyä  is the shadow of this yogamäyä . The first, yogamäyä ,
arranges yoga , the enactment of the lélä of Bhagavän, who
is omniscient ( sarva-jïä ) and omnipotent ( sarva-çaktimän ).
Yogamäyä  does this by putting Him and His associates in
transcendental illusion. She also arranges for the yoga
(union) of Bhagavän and the jévas  who are practising
sädhana-bhakti . That is why this potency is called yogamäyä .
On the other hand, mahämäyä bewitches those jévas  who
are averse to Bhagavän, and binds them by the results oftheir various activities. A cloud cannot cover the sun; rather,it is only the eyes of the jévas  situated on earth which are
covered. Similarly, mahämäyä  cannot cover Bhagavän, but
can only cover the knowledge of the jévas and thus prevent
them from seeing Him.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Do
not think that I was previously unmanifest and that I havenow manifested this beautiful sac-cid-änanda  form of
Çyämasundara. My Çyämasundara form is eternal. Althoughthis form is like the self-effulgent spiritual sun of the tran-scendental realm, it remains hidden from the vision of com-mon men because it is covered by the shadow of yogamäyä .
The less intelligent cannot understand My avyaya-svarüpa

How long have the jévas been bewildered by Your mäyä ?
Çré Bhagavän anticipates this question by speaking thisçloka  beginning with icchä . Sarga  means creation. All jévas
have been bewildered since the beginning of creation. Bywhat? By desire and hate which is born from their previ-ÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !459
ous karma . They are deluded by the dualities which arise
from the desire for sense objects which are to their liking,and from aversion to those which are not. Examples of thisare honour and dishonour, cold and heat, happiness anddistress, male and female. The jévas are bewildered by the
designations which are delusions born of ignorance, suchas I am honoured, therefore I am happy; I am disrespected,therefore I am miserable; this beautiful woman is my wife;this man is my husband. In other words, they become deeplyattached to wife, children and so on. Those with such deepworldly attachment do not have the right to engage in Mybhakti . As I have said to Uddhava in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.8): By good fortune, a person who has developedçraddhä  in hearing My kathä  and who has neither repul-
sion nor excessive attachment to sense objects attains per-fection in bhakti-yoga .

The jévas remain bereft of Parameçvara jïäna because they
are deluded by mäyä . At that time, being further bewildered
by the delusion of duality arising from desire and hate, theiraversion to Kåñëa becomes deeper. The reason for this is thatthe jéva in his pure state sees the eternal form of Bhagavän
with his transcendental senses. However, the baddha-jéva  in
the material world is overpowered by avidyä and remains
bewildered by duality which arises from desire and hate. Atthat time, he becomes bereft of vidvat-pratéti , access to tran-
scendence. Bhagavän becomes visible to the material eyes ofthe jévas by yoga (union) with the cit-çakti by which He
manifests His nitya-svarüpa . Even then, such persons think
that the svarüpa  of Bhagavän is temporary. They do not have
the proper knowledge to perceive Him, because they are cov-ered by mäyä.  This is their great misfortune.27! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 460

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Who then, has the adhikära  to perform bhakti ? In an-
swer to this, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with
the word yeñäm . When ones sins are almost destroyed by
pious activities, sattva -guëa  rises within him and reduces
tamo-guëa  and its effect, delusion. When he associates with
My bhakta , who is not overly attached to this world, his
delusion decreases, and he engages in My bhajana  by his own
will. Only those whose sins are completely destroyed by thepractice of devotional service to Me have become completelyfree from delusion and perform My bhajana  with great de-
termination. Pious deeds alone are not the cause of bhakti .
Çré Bhagavän says in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.12.9):  Bhakti
cannot be attained by a person endeavouring in yoga, säìkhya ,
däna , vrata , tapasyä , yajïa , vairägya and study of the çästra .
One does not attain bhakti-yoga  simply by taking shelter of
pious activities. This has been established in various ways.ÇLOKA VIJÏÄNA -YOGA !461
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
There are two ways in which the baddha-jévas  attain one-
pointedness in bhajana  to Bhagavän. Firstly, a jéva who is
bound by mäyä  may by good fortune, develop çraddhä  in
hearing hari-kathä in the association of devotees, although
he is not yet performing bhakti  to Kåñëa. Then, by continu-
ously hearing descriptions of His name, form and qualities,he becomes free from sins ( anarthas ) and detached from
worldliness. He develops niñöhä  towards Kåñëa and progres-
sively enters aikäntika-bhakti . In the second category are the
jévas who have not completely renounced sense-objects, but
are also not excessively attached to them. When such jévas,
by great fortune, attain the association of a mahä-bhägavata ,
they engage in bhajana , and, as a result, all their sins, their
attachment to sense enjoyment and their delusion are re-moved, and they also develop niñöhä  in bhajana . Having
achieved such niñöhä , they enter aikäntika-bhakti . The asso-
ciation of mahä-puruñas , their mercy and ones endeavour to
perform bhajana  are the only means of attaining bhakti .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Hear
from Me how one can gain the adhikära  to realise My nitya-
svarüpa . The asuras  who are overpowered by a sinful nature
do not have such access. One who has completely eradicatedhis sins by performing many pious deeds and by following aregulated dharmika  life performs niñkäma-karma -yoga in the
beginning, then jïäna -yoga, and finally one achieves samädhi
by dhyäna -yoga.  Only then is he able to realise My eternal,
beautiful cit-tattva  Çyämasundara form. That realisation
which comes by virtue of vidyä  (transcendental knowledge)
is called vidvat-pratéti . Only those who are endowed with this
realisation can gradually become free from dvaita  (duality) and
advaita  (non-duality), and can engage in My bhajana  with
great determination.28! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  7 462

Çré Bhagavän said earlier that all sakäma -bhaktas , such as
the distressed, become perfect by performing His bhajana .
Others however, who worship the devas , will degrade them-
selves and remain in the material world. In saying this,Bhagavän is also referring to those who are unqualified toperform His bhajana . Here, in this çloka beginning with  jarä,
Çré Bhagavän is speaking about the fourth type of sakäma -
bhakta . Those yogés  who endeavour to stop the cycle of old
age and death, and who worship Me with a desire for mokña
are, by the influence of My bhakti , eventually able to attain
full understanding of brahma  (that is, My eternal beautiful
Çyämasundara form), adhyätmä (the complete self, or the jéva

Bhagavän first explained the first three types of sakäma -
bhaktas , such as the distressed. They initially perform My
bhajana  in order to attain their desired goals. After they have
attained these goals and understood that such goals are ac-tually miserable and degrading, they become detached fromthem. Finally, by taking sädhu-saìga , they become success-
ful and attain My aikäntika-bhakti . In the present çloka ,
Bhagavän is explaining the fourth type of bhakta , namely
the sakäma -bhakta  who desires mokña . When such sakäma -
bhaktas  achieve the association of My çuddha-bhaktas , they
lose their desire to attain brahma-säyujya  and focus on be-
coming situated in their pure constitutional form as the ser-vants of Bhagavän. These sakäma-jïäné bhaktas  are real
mumukñus , persons who desire mokña . Only such brahma-
bhüta-jïäné bhaktas  (who have attained the nature of
brahma ) completely understand brahma-tattva , adhyätma-
tattva  and karma -tattva and attain parä bhakti.

in this material world, whereby the development of
the jévas  material bodies and their expansions take
place, is known as karma .! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  8 468
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
While answering Arjunas questions, Çré Bhagavän says that
brahma is that which is imperishable and eternally supreme.
O Gärgé, the learned brähmaëas  call it akñara  (Båhad-
äraëyaka Upaniñad  3.8.8).
Svabhävaù : Those who create material bodies because they
identifiy their ätmä  with the body ( sva-bhävayati ) are called
svabhävaù , or jévas (in the conditioned state) . The word
svabhävaù  also means  jévas in their constitutional state, and
refers to those who situate themselves in their pure state bycultivating bhakti , and attain svaà  (Paramätmä). Here
svabhävaù  does not refer to the conditioned jéva but to the
unalloyed entity, the çuddha-jéva , who is also known as
adhyätma . Visarga , or the jévas  saàsära , results in bhüta-
bhäva-udbhava-karaù , the gross and subtle elements which
create human and other bodies according to the conscious-ness of the jéva. Saàsära  (the cycle of material existence) is
created by the karma  (action) of the jéva, so here the word
karma  indicates the material existence of the jéva.

Brahma means that which does not perish. It is called
akñara  because it is infallible. Akñara-tattva  is free from de-
struction and transformation and is also called parabrahma .
Here it should be understood that only saviçeña-maya
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, the Conscious Reality who possesses alltranscendental attributes, is parabrahma , not nirviçeña-
brahma , His featureless impersonal aspect. Although the word
akñara  refers to all three features of the Supreme, namely
brahma , Paramätmä and Bhagavän, here it only indicates
parabrahma , Svayaà Bhagavän. One should deliberate on
Gétä  (15.16-18) for a detailed understanding of this subject.
This is also established in the prayers of Lord BrahmäÇLOKA TÄRAKA  BRAHMA -YOGA !469
(Çrémad-Bhägavatam  10.14.32): yan-mitraà paramänandaà
/ pürëaà brahma sanätanam. Çré Kåñëa, who is the com-
plete, eternal brahma , and whose form  is composed of su-
preme bliss, is their friend. This is also cited in Caitanya-
caritämåta  (Madhya-lélä  19.96): aham iha nandaà vande /
yasyälinde paraà brahma. I forever worship that Nanda
Mahäräja in whose courtyard parabrahma  is playing as
Nandanandana.
Adhyätma means svabhävaù , or the çuddha-jéva situated in
his unalloyed state, free from any contact with inert matter.
Svaà bhävayati  means that one maintains the conception,
I am this gross body, due to contact and identification withthe body. There is another meaning of svabhävaù , or svaà
bhävayati.  The jéva who realises Paramätma is called svabhävaù.
Çrépäda Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa also translates the wordsvabhävaù  as the jévätmä : jévätmänaù sambandhé yo bhävo.
Bhäva , or existence, in relationship with the jévätmä is called
svabhävaù.  That same jévätmä who has taken shelter of the
body considers himself to be the enjoyer of sense objects.Therefore, the word adhyätma  refers to the jéva.
Visarga means yajïa which is performed by offering ma-
terial ingredients for the pleasure of the devatäs.  This gives
rise to the gross and subtle elements, which in turn createthe material world in the form of the jévas  gross bodies. This
should be understood as visarga , the material existence of
the jéva.

Adhibhüta  refers to perishable objects such as pots and
cloth which exist by taking the support of the living enti-ties. According to the Nirukta (Vedic dictionary), adhidaiva
refers to the viräö-puruña , who has authority over the devatäs
such as Sürya. I inspire activity  such as yajïa  by My par-
tial expansion as Antaryämé; hence I am adhiyajïa . An-
ticipating the doubt, How are You situated as adhiyajïa ?
Bhagavän speaks the words aham eva  (only I). Only I am
to be known in My non-different expansion of Antaryämé.Unlike the jévas (adhyätma ), My portion ( aàça ) Antaryämé
is non-different from Me. The jévätmä is My separated part

Here Çré Bhagavän is answering three of Arjunas questions:
Adhibhüta: Gross articles such as pots or cloth, which are
perishable and which change at every moment, exist by tak-ing support of the living entities, and are thus called adhibhüta .ÇLOKA TÄRAKA  BRAHMA -YOGA !471
Adhidaiva: T he complete cosmic being or viräö-puruña  is
called adhidaiva because He has sovereignty over the devatäs .
Adhiyajïa: The word adhiyajïa refers to the puruña  who
is situated in the bodies of the jévas  as all-pervading
Antaryämé, who inspires action ( karma ) such as yajïa , and
who gives the results of karma . Antaryämé is sväàça-tattva ,
a plenary portion of Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa. It is said in theÇvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (4.6):
dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyä / samänaà våkñaà pariñasvajäte
tayor anyaù pippalaà svädv atty / anaçnann anyo bhicäkaçéti
Kñérodakaçäyé-puruña and the jéva live as two friendly birds on
the branch of a banyan tree, which is likened to this temporarymaterial body. The jéva tastes the fruits of the tree according to
his karma , while the other bird, Paramätmä, is not engaged in
enjoying the fruits, but simply witnesses the jévas  activities.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.2.8) Çré Sukadeva Gosvämé also
says:
kecit sva-dehäntar-hådayävakäçe
prädeça-mätraà puruñaà vasantam
Some yogés  remember the prädeça-mätra puruña  who is situated
within the cave of their hearts.
The word prädeça-mätra  has been translated by Çréla
Çrédhara Svämé as the distance from the thumb to the tip ofthe first finger. Çréla Cakravarté Öhäkura says, By Hisacintya-çakti , He is situated within that area as a fifteen-
year-old kiçora.  Moreover, it is said in Kaöha Upaniñad
(2.1.12): anguñöha-mätraù puruño madhya ätmani tiñtùati.
Antaryämé puruña is the size of a thumb and is situated in
the middle part of the body, the heart.
All this evidence proves that Antaryämé Paramätmä is
situated within the heart of the ordinary jéva, and occu-
pies a space the size of the thumb. For His special bhaktas ,4! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  8 472
however, Kåñëa Himself is situated in their hearts in His
kiçora  form as a fifteen-year-old. For example, that
Antaryämé situated within the heart of Bilvamaìgala isnone other than the transcendental kiçora , Çré Kåñëa
Himself. As he says in Kåñëa-karëämåta  (1): cintämaëir
jayati somagirir gurur me / çikñä-guruç ca bhagavän çikhi-piccha-mauliù. All glories to Cintämaëi, whom I consider
to be my guru , and who has fulfilled all desires. All glo-
ries to my guru , Somagiri, and to my çikñä-guru , Bhagavän
Çré Kåñëa, who has a peacock feather in His hair and whois situated in my heart.
The Antaryämé situated in the heart of Arjuna is the same
kiçora  Kåñëa Himself, who is situated on his chariot.

Just as one attains Me by remembering Me only, similarly,
one also attains the state corresponding to whatever or who-ever else he remembers. To explain this, Çri Bhagavän is

By remembering Bhagavän at the time of death, one at-
tains His nature. Similarly, one attains a nature correspond-ing to the other beings and objects one remembers. Bharata5 - 6! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  8 474
Mahäräja thought of a young deer at the time of death and
in his next life he received the body of a deer. For this rea-son, one must not think of anything except Bhagavän atthe time of death. To attain such consciousness, it is im-perative to endeavour in this direction from the very be-ginning of ones life. Although Bharata Mahäräja was abhakta  of high calibre and was situated on the platform of
bhäva , he was reborn as a young deer by the will of the Lord
to set an example for humanity. Because he had remem-brance of his past life, he completely avoided the associa-tion of materialistic persons in his next and subsequentbirths, and remained engaged in the cultivation of bhakti .
The ordinary jévas , who are bound by the results of their
karma , should take a good lesson from the example of
Bharata Mahäräja, and should not commit offences at hisfeet, thinking that he was bound by the result of karma as
they are. Furthermore, the story of Puraïjana described in
the Bhägavatam  shows how he attained the body of a
woman in his next life, because he was thinking of a womanat the time of death. Actually, whatever we do during thecourse of our lives influences our consciousness at the timeof death, and we take another birth accordingly. This is whysädhakas  should perform hari-näma  and practise çuddha-
bhakti  in this life, so that at the time of death they will be
able to remember Bhagavän intensely, and their path toeternal auspiciousness will become blessed.

In this way, he who practises remembering Me during his

Bhagavän is speaking this çloka  beginning with the words
abhyäsa-yoga.  Abhyäsa  means to practise continuous remem-
brance of Me, and yoga means to fix the mind in such prac-

It is necessary to engage in abhyäsa-yoga in order to attain
unbroken continuity in bhajana  (like the flow of a stream
which cannot be checked). One will be able to engage the
mind in remembering Çré Bhagavän by the performance of
abhyäsa-yoga  and by withdrawing it from other sense objects.
By continually practising remembrance of Çré Kåñëa through-out ones life, one will be able to conquer the distracted mind,thus enabling one to remember Kåñëa at the time of death.This is also stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.20.18):

time of death, fully fixes his life air between the eyebrowsby the strength of 
yoga, and concentrates with undeviat-

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
It is impossible to withdraw the mind from sense-objects
without yogäbhyäsa.  Without continuous practise of yoga, it
is impossible to remember Çré Bhagavän. Bhakti  which is
mixed with any type of yoga is called yoga-miçrä bhakti . Çré
Bhagavän is explaining this in the next four çlokas  begin-
ning here with kavim . Kavim  means omniscient. Åñis such as
Sanaka are sarva-jïa (omniscient), but their omniscient
nature is not unlimited. This is why Çré Bhagavän is usingthe word puräëam , without beginning. Although Antaryämé
is omniscient and beginningless, He does not give instructionsin bhakti , so Bhagavän is saying anuçäsitäram , meaning that
He mercifully gives instructions on bhakti  through His
svarüpa-avatäras such as Çré Räma and Çré Kåñëa. The tattva
of such a merciful personality is very difficult to understand.
He says that He is more subtle than the most subtle. Does
this mean that He is atomic like the jéva? To clarify this, He
says: sarvasya dhätäram.  I am the sustainer of everything,
and because I am all-pervading, I am of unlimited size, there-fore I am acintya (inconceivable). Although He has a hu-
man-like form, He is explaining His manifestations who arenon-different from Him.  Äditya-varëam  means that, like
Sürya, He illuminates both Himself and others. He is beyondmaterial nature  (tamasaù ) and, although He is the master of
mäyä çakti , He is beyond mäyä . At the time of death,  yogés
remember Him with undeviated minds. They are blessed with
the potency of continuous remembrance of Him that they have
practised during their lives. How does one attain this stabilityof mind? Bhagavän says, He attains it on the strength ofÇLOKA TÄRAKA  BRAHMA -YOGA !479
yogäbhyäsa . What type of yoga? He answers, The yoga in
which the life air is fixed between the eyebrows ( äjïä-cakra ).

In the previous çloka , the process of remembering Çré
Bhagavän at the time of death was mentioned, and now it isexplained in this çloka .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Please
listen as I explain the process of meditation on the SupremePerson ( parama puruña ). He is omniscient, beginningless and
inconceivable to mundane intelligence. He is the smallest,yet He is also the Supreme Controller who maintains every-one. He exists eternally in His beautiful, human-likeÇyämasundara form. His tattva  is beyond material nature and,
because He is self-illuminating like the sun, His bodily hueilluminates His form. One who leaves his body having madehis mind steady by bhakti , and who fixes the life air between
the eyebrows by the power of yogäbhyäsa , attains that Su-
preme Person. This yoga system has been instructed to en-
sure that ones attention is not distracted from the parama
puruña  by suffering and pain at the time of death.

air on the äjïä-cakra ? What type of yoga  is this? What is

yad and the next two çlokas.  Oàkära , the sound manifes-
tation of brahma , is akñara (imperishable) and is identical

peating in his mind the pure form of brahma-akñara , the
sound manifestation of brahma  (praëava ), made of three
letters: a, u and m.

Praëava  is the essence of all the Vedas  and is the mahä-väkya ,
the greatest syllable (sound vibration). All other mantras  have
limitations. Praëava  is identical with the çré-murti  of Jagadiça.
All the Vedas  as well as this universe are generated from praëava .
The essence of the Vedas is indeed this  mahä-väkya  in the form
of praëava.  It is the svarüpa of Bhagavän and the basis of the
whole universe.

One may doubt what is said in the Second Canto of Çrémad-
Bhägavatam (2.6.19), Above the three planetary systems
(bhür , bhuvaù and svaù ) is Maha-loka and above Maha-loka16-17! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  8 488
are the three planets Jana, Tapa and Satya. These three are
immortal, contain all the requirements for ones mainte-nance, and are free from fear. Some say that Brahma-lokais free from fear, and that even  sannyäsés  desire to dwell
there. Does this mean that those residing on that planet willnever die? Anticipating this question, Çré Bhagavän states,No, it is not true. Brahmä, the master of that planet, him-self dies, so what to speak of others. To clarify this further,He speaks this çloka  beginning with sahasra , which says that
those who know çästra  understand that Brahmäs one day
equals one thousand cycles of the four yugas (totalling
4,320,000,000 years) and his night is of the same duration.After Brahmäs great life span of one hundred years of thesedays and nights, fortnights and months, he falls and dies, butthat Brahmä who is a Vaiñëava attains mukti.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, According to the cal-
culation of human beings, one day of Brahmä is equal to onethousand cycles of four yugas , and his night is of the same
period. In this way, Brahmä falls or dies after living for onehundred such years. However, those Brahmäs who are devotedto Çré Bhagavän achieve mukti . If this is Brahmäs situation,
then how can the fearlessness of sannyäsés  who have attained
his planet be eternal? It cannot be. They are also bound totake birth again.

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Those who are residents of the lower three planets, bhür ,
bhuvaù  and svaù, must die in every day of Brahmä. For this
reason, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the word
avyaktäd.  Çrépada Madhusüdana Sarasvaté says, In the cycle
of the creation and annihilation of Brahmäs day, the elementsky exists daily. Therefore, the word avyakta  in this çloka does
not refer to the pradhäna  but indicates Brahmäs night.
From that unmanifest cause, namely Brahmäs night, comes
his day, which manifests the field for enjoyment in the formof the body, sense objects and so forth. The whole world be-comes actively manifest in this way. Then, at the approachof his night, it is again dissolved into the unmanifest causewhile he sleeps.

Previously You said, After attaining My parama-dhäma ,

after attaining Your abode, Your bhaktas never return. Yet,

their paths and the time of their passing are also nirguëa .

brahma .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Here, Çré Bhagavän is explaining how to follow the path
from which there is no return. It is said in Chändogya
Upaniñad : te rciñam abhisambhavanti. They attain the presid-
ing deva of arci (the sunrays). Therefore, the words agniù  and
jyotiù  indicate the presiding deva of arci. The word ahaù  refers
to the presiding deva of the day, and the word uttaräyaëam
refers to its presiding deva of the six months of the northern
course of the sun. The jïänés , or those who are brahma-vid
(who know brahma ), attain brahma  by following this path.
In this regard, the çrutis  say that they attain the deva pre-
siding over arci, and then the devas of the day, the fortnight
and month in that order. From the deva of the month, they
attain the deva of the year, and then Äditya, the sun-god.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Now Çré Bhagavän is concluding the topic of the above-

çukla-kåñëa.  Çäçvat  means that there are two eternal paths
in this world of beginningless saàsära . One is çukla-pakña ,
by which one attains mokña , and the other is kåñëa-pakña ,
by which one returns to the material world.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The above mentioned paths of arci, etc., or deva-yäna  (voy-

knowledge, and are well known by the name çukla-gati (the25-26! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  8 498
bright path). The path of smoke, etc., or pitå-yäna (voyage
through the path of the forefathers), is full of darkness andignorance, and is called kåñëa-gati  (the dark path). From time
immemorial, these two paths have functioned in this world.Those yogés who are brahma-vid  take shelter of the bright
path, and passing through the planets of arci and so forth in
the paths of the devas , they gradually attain mokña . On the
other hand, those yogés  who engage in karma  to satisfy their
own desires take shelter of kåñëa-gati  through pitå-yäna  (the
path of the forefathers). They enjoy the heavenly pleasuresof Svarga,  having passed through the paths of the presiding
devas  of darkness and so on, and finally return to this mate-

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The benefit attained by acquiring jïäna  as described in this
chapter is explained in this çloka  beginning with vedeñu.  Ta t
sarvam atyeti  means that, by surpassing the results of all these
activities, the bhakti-yogé attains a superior place which is
eternal and apräkåta , transcendental.
The superiority of a bhakti-yogé  was also described earlier,
but here it is clarified further. In this chapter, the supremacyof the ananya-bhaktas has been established.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä ,
by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura , on the Eighth Chapter
of Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä , which gives pleasure to the bhaktas

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, If you follow bhakti-yoga ,
you will not be denied the results of any other activity. Youwill attain whatever results may come from yajïa , tapasyä ,
däna , or any type of jïäna  or from studying the Vedas , and
you will reach My supremely transcendental and eternalrealm. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.20.32-33) it is stated:

Through bhakti-yoga  My devotee  can easily attain whatever a
sädhaka  achieves by performing karma , tapasyä , jïäna , vairägya
and so on.
In the Mahäbhärata  there is a statement pertaining to
mokña : yä vai sädhana-sampattiù puruñärtha-catuñöaye / tayä

one attains from the four goals of human life ( dharma , artha ,
käma and mokña ) without undergoing any misery.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also says that one
attains all auspiciousness by performing kevala-bhakti , and
without bhakti  one cannot attain anything. Thus, bhakti  is
established as the supreme auspicious process in both ways,by the direct and indirect statements of çästra . This is also
stated in Närada-païcarätra : hari-bhakti-mahä-devyäù sarvä
muktyädi sidhyaù bhuktayaç cädbhutäs tasyaç ceöakavadanuvratäù.  Brahma-vidyä  and the eight types of perfection,
such as aëimä , appear in their personified form like devoted
servants before an ananya-bhakta even when they are not
desired.
In his Vidvat-raïjana-bhäñya , Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura
writes, Faith turns into niñtùä , or exclusive absorption in My
service, when the anarthas of a devotee  who has single one-
pointed faith are removed by bhajana , in the association of
My bhaktas . All sins are removed by bhajana  in saintly as-
sociation ( sädhu-saìga ), even though çraddhä  may not have
fully developed yet, an understanding of tattva  may be lack-
ing, and doubts about the worshipable Deity may still lingeras impurities.
Moods of devotion that are mixed with jïäna (jïäna-
miçrä-bhäva ) and yoga (yoga-miçrä-bhäva ), and polluted by
bhukti and mukti  are anarthas  that prevent one from under-
standing bhajana-tattva . Ones bhajana  becomes purified of
these anarthas , to the extent that the tendency of ones bhakti
becomes kevalä  (one-pointed) and he takes shelter of
viçuddha-tattva , the pure, Absolute Reality of Çré Bhagavän.
This is the essence of the Eighth Chapter.
Thus ends the Särärtha-Varñiëé Prakäçikä-våtti ,

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The Ninth Chapter gives knowledge of Çré Bhagaväns
aiçvarya.  Such jïäna  is desired by His bhaktas  so that they
can favourably execute their service to Him. This chapterclearly describes the supremacy of çuddha-bhakti .
In comparison to karma , jïäna  and yoga , we find that
bhakti is supreme. Bhakti  is of two types: pradhäné-bhütä  and
kevalä , both of which have been explained in the Seventh
and Eighth Chapters. Of these two, kevala-bhakti  is extremely
powerful and unlike jïäna does not depend upon purity of
heart. This in itself substantiates the supremacy of  kevala-
bhakti . Knowledge of Bhagaväns aiçvarya  is necessary to
perform kevala-bhakti . Details of that aiçvarya are given in
this Ninth Chapter. The middle eight chapters (Six to Thir-teen), are the essence of Bhagavad-gétä and of all Vedic  lit-
erature, and the Ninth and Tenth Chapters are the essenceof these middle chapters. Çré Bhagavän is glorifying the sub-ject matter that will be defined in three consecutive çlokas ,
the first of which begins with the words idaà tu . Jïäna ,
which is favourable for liberation, as described in the Sec-ond and Third Chapters, is called guhyam , confidential . The
Seventh and Eighth Chapters explain knowledge of bhagavat-
tattva , which is essential for one who wishes to attain Me.
Such knowledge of bhakti-tattva  is called guhyatara , more
confidential. Now in this chapter I shall explain that jïäna
along with the characteristics of çuddha-bhakti , which is
guhyatama , most confidential.
Here the word jïäna  should only be understood to mean
bhakti.  It does not refer to the regular jïäna  delineated in
the first six chapters. In the next çloka , the word jïäna  indi-ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !505 1
cates only  bhakti  since the word avyaya , eternal, has been
used as an adjective for jïäna . This is because it refers to a
transcendental nature in this context and it does not indi-cate the jïäna  previously  mentioned, which is sättvika , but
not nirguëa or guëätéta .
In the çloka : açraddadhänäù puruñä dharmasyäsya
parantapa (Gétä 9.3), the word dharma only means bhakti.
Here the word anasüyave  means that this instruction is for
those who are non-envious. It is not meant for others.Vijïäna-sahitam  means, I shall impart this instruction to
you which leads to direct realisation of Me. This will freeyou from an inauspicious life, which is unfavourable to bhakti .
With this jïäna , you will become free from all obstacles.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, Çré Kåñëa explained
pradhäné-bhütä  bhakti and kevala-bhakti , and the difference
between the two. In the present chapter He is clarifying thesupremacy of kevala-bhakti.  Kevala-bhakti  does not depend on
purification of the heart. Bhakti Devi can even mercifully enterthe hearts of extremely abominable persons who are grippedby all types of anarthas , and turn those persons into supremely
pure, highly exalted mahä-bhägavatas  who are worshipable for
the whole world. She is very powerful in her own right.
Spiritual jïäna , as explained in the Second and Third
Chapters, is helpful to attain mokña  and it is guhya , confi-
dential. Bhagavat-tattva-jïäna , as described in the Seventh
and Eighth Chapters, causes bhakti  to appear and is
guhyatara , more confidential. The present chapter describes
jïäna  related to kevala-bhakti , as instructed by Bhagavän.
This jïäna is guhyatama , most confidential. Only with the
help of this guhyatama-jïäna  can one attain freedom from
the inauspiciousness of this world. This guhyatama-jïäna
related to çuddha-bhakti  is parama-vijïäna-maya , that is,! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 506
it can bestow direct realisation of Me. Vijïäna  means to
comprehend that jïäna  which is related to Çré Bhagavän,
specifically with realisation. Bhagavän said to Brahmä:
jïänaà parama-guhyaà me / yad vijïäna-samanvitam
sarahasyaà tad-aìgaï ca / gåhäëa gaditaà mayä
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  2.9.31
Knowledge of Me is non-dual, absolute and highly confidential.
Although non-dual, it has four eternal divisions: jïäna (My
svarüpa ), vijïäna (realisation of Me), rahasya  (prema-bhakti  unto
Me) and tad-aìga-pradhäna (sädhana-bhakti , the means to attain
Me).  The jéva cannot understand this with his limited intelligence.
He can only realise it by My mercy.  Jïäna is My svarüpa  and vijïäna
is ones relationship with Me through bhakti.  The jéva is My rahasya
and the pradhäna  is My jïäna-aìga (all that is accessory to My
svarüpa ).The eternal non-duality and the eternal confidential
difference between these four principles is due to My acintya-çakti .
Bhagavän also spoke this to Uddhava:
athaitat paramaà guhyaà / çåëvato yadu-nandana
su-gopyam api vakñyämi / tvaà me bhåtyaù suhåt sakhä
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.11.49
O Yadu-nandana (Uddhava), please hear this most confiden-
tial knowledge. Although it is extremely confidential, I will speakit to you because you are My servant and well-wishing friend.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.1.8), Çré Çaunaka and other åñis
requested Çréla Süta Gosvämé to explain such realised con-fidential truths:
vetthaà tvaà saumya tat sarvaà
tattvatas tad-anugrahät
brüyuù snigdhasya çiñyasya
guravo guhyam apy uta
The guru-varga also explains these extremely confidential se-ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !507
crets to disciples of an affectionate nature.
 Here also, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa is imparting this guhyatama-
jïäna  to Arjuna knowing him to be free from envy and ha-
tred, and possessing an affectionate heart. The meaning isthat this guhyatama-jïäna  is instructed by a genuine tattva-
jïa-guru , only to the type of disciple previously mentioned.
A similar instruction is given in Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad
(6.2223):
vedänte paramaà guhyaà puräkalpe pracoditam
näpraçäntäya dätavyaà näputräya siñyäya vä punaù
yasya deve parä bhaktir yathä deve tathä gurau
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäù prakäçante mahätmanaù
Bhagavad-upäsanä-tattva , the principle of worshipping Bhagavän,
is the essence of Vedänta  and is highly confidential. In ancient
times, Çré Bhagavän illuminated the heart of Çvetäçvatara Åñiwith this tattva , being pleased by his worship. Therefore, al-
though this instruction is not for one who is not a çuddha-bhakta ,
it can be bestowed to a sober son or disciple who is a bhakta of
Bhagavän. This instruction should not be imparted to anyoneelse, even if one is moved by affection for that person.
All the confidential meanings of the çrutis  fully illuminate
the heart of that sädhaka , that mahätmä  who has parä bhakti
for Bhagavän and equally for his gurudeva. In this context,
it is worth contemplating Bhagavad-gétä (18.54-58).

virtue; (it is) karttum su-sukham performed joyfully (without
difficulty); (it is) avyayam imperishable.
This jïäna  is the king of all knowledge and the mon-
arch of all confidential subjects. It is extremely pureand, since it directly reveals the nature of the self, it isthe perfection of 
dharma . It is joyfully performed, be-
stowing transcendental and imperishable results.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Moreover, this knowledge is the king of all knowledge.
There are various types of jïäna  and worship, but their only
räjä (king) is bhakti.  This bhakti  is the räjä of confidential
subjects. In other words, bhakti  herself is very confidential.
Although knowledge  is of many varieties, this particular
jïäna (bhakti ), along with vijïäna  (realisation of that knowl-
edge), is the räjä of them all, as it is the most confidential.
All sinful activities are atoned for by this bhakti (jïäna  along
with vijïäna ), which shows that this bhakti is pure. It is more
purifying than tvaà-padärtha-jïäna , knowledge of the self.
Çrépäda Madhusüdana Sarasvaté says that this bhakti  can
destroy, within the blink of an eye, the gross and subtle stagesof all types of sinful activities accumulated over thousandsof lifetimes, as well as their cause, which is ignorance. Thusit is supremely purifying. Pratyakña avagamam  means that
which can be perceived or realised directly.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.42) states:
bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir
anyatra caiña trika eka-kälaù
prapadyamänasya yathäçnataù syus
tuñöiù puñöiù kñud-apäyo nu-ghäsamÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !509
A person who is absorbed in eating achieves happiness from
tasting every mouthful of food, nourishment as his stomachis filled and relief as his hunger is removed. These three re-sults come to him simultaneously. In the same way, a personwho is engaged in bhajana  of Çré Hari simultaneously attains
prema , realisation of Parameçvara and detachment from sense
objects.
According to this statement from the Eleventh Canto, a
person attains realisation of Bhagavän in proportion to theintensity of his bhajana . This jïäna  (bhakti ) is dharmyam ,
meaning that it is not beyond the boundaries of dharmika
laws (i.e. not adharmika ). A person can attain the perfec-
tion of all occupational duties simply by bhakti , even if he
does not perform any other dharmika duties. In Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (4.31.14), Devaåñi Närada also says, Just as by
watering the root of a tree, its trunk, branches and leaves
become nourished, similarly, by worshipping BhagavänAcyuta alone, everyone else is automatically worshipped.
Karttuà su-sukham  means that one does not have to un-
dergo too much physical, mental or verbal misery on the pathof bhakti , unlike the processes of karma , jïäna , etc. In the
practice of bhakti , characterised by çravaëam , kértanam and
so on, only the senses such as the ears and tongue are en-gaged. Since bhakti  is beyond the modes ( nirguëa ), it is not
perishable like karma , jïäna and so forth.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
This Ninth Chapter describes kevala-bhakti , which is
nirguëa . This jïäna  in the form of kevala-bhakti  is the crest-
jewel of all vidyä.  It is supremely confidential, most purify-
ing and experienced by direct perception. It bestows the fruitsof all other dharmika processes, is joyfully performed and
bestows imperishable results.2! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 510
Here, the word vidyä  means worship  (upäsanä ), hence
kevala-bhakti  is the best of all vidyäs.  For this reason, it is
called räja-vidyä and, because it is the most confidential
among all confidential subjects, it is called räja-guhya .
Pavitram idam uttamam : Sins are not completely destroyed
by performing atonements such as däna (charity), yajïa (of-
fering oblations) and tapas (cändräyaëa-vrata etc.). Further-
more, even by once removing the results of sins through suchprocesses as tapasyä  and brahmacarya , there is the possibil-
ity that the tendency to sin will again sprout. However, ac-cording to çästras such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam , sins are com-
pletely destroyed by the performance of kevala-bhakti.  This
is true to such an extent that all sins are destroyed at theroot simply by the concomitant results of kevala-bhakti . In
other words, even the very desire to perform sin is destroyed.This is not possible by processes other than bhakti , such as
präyaçcitta (atonement), brahmacarya and tapasyä. In
Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.1.15) this is confirmed:  kecit kevalayä
bhaktyä / väsudeva-paräyaëäù. Only by  kevala-bhakti can
all ones sins be eradicated at the root.  And also in 6.1.16,
na tathä hy aghavän räjan / püyeta tapa-ädibhiù. All ones
sins can be removed only by service to Çré Kåñëas pure rep-resentative and not by any other process.
In Çré Bhakti -rasämåta-sindhu , the first characteristic of
kevala-bhakti  is described as kleça-ghné. Kleça-ghné  means that
this bhakti  completely destroys all sin  (päpa ), the seed of sin
(päpa-béja ), ignorance ( avidyä ), fructified reaction ( prärabdha-
karma ) and unfructified reaction ( aprärabdha-karma ).

Kevala-bhakti  not only purifies the gross and subtle desig-
nations of the jéva, but it also purifies and satisfies the  ätmä :ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !511
yayätmä suprasédati  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.2.6). According to
the çloka : ätmärämäç ca munayo  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.7.10),
bhaktis  attraction is the bliss one derives from serving Kåñëa,
by which even those who are ätmäräma  (satisfied within the
self) and äptakäma  (who have no desires left to fulfil) are
attracted and give up such natures.
Pratyakña anubhava-svarüpa : Just as a person feels satis-
faction, nourishment and the removal of hunger with everymouthful of food that he eats, similarly prema , direct expe-
rience of Bhagavän, as well as aversion to sense enjoyment,appear simultaneously within a sädhaka-bhakta , even dur-
ing sädhana-daçä  (the practice stage).

tuñöiù puñöiù kñud-apäyo nu-ghäsam
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.2.42
The processes of karma , yoga, jïäna , etc., cannot bestow
direct realisation upon the sädhaka  in the way that bhakti
can. Brahma-sütra  also states: prakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät.
Bhakti  is so powerful that she bestows an experience of
herself even in the initial stages.
Sarva-dharma-phala-prada : By performing bhakti  one re-
ceives the complete result of all types of dharma  and also at-
tains bhagavat-prema , which is the objective established in
the Vedas , Upaniñads  and other çrutis . According to the çloka :
sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja (Gétä
18.66), having given up all types of dharma , such as
varëäçrama-dharma , karma , jïäna , yoga and all other paths
that are followed for the purpose of satisfying the body andmind, and taking exclusive shelter of kevala-bhakti  by per-
forming bhajana  to Çré Kåñëa, one can easily and naturally
attain the result of all the previously mentioned processes.2! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 512
As it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.13): saàsiddhir hari-
toñaëam , The highest perfection in life is to please Çré Hari.
And (11.20.33): sarvaà mad-bhakti-yogena / mad-bhakto
labhate ïjasä , By pure devotional service My bhakta can
very easily achieve such benedictions as Svarga, liberationor My supreme abode.
Although the performance of different dharmika  processes
does not exist in the practice of kevala-bhakti , the real dharma
of the jéva, which is to serve guru and so forth, remains present
within him. The çruti also confirms this opinion in mantras
such as: äcäryavän puruño veda . Devaåñi Närada also estab-
lishes this in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (4.31.14):
yathä taror müla-niñecanena
tåpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaçäkhäù
präëopahäräc ca yathendriyäëäà
tathaiva sarvärhaëam acyutejyä
Just as by properly watering the root of a tree, its trunk, branches,
twigs, leaves and flowers are nourished, and just as by eating foodthe präëa  (life air) is satisfied and all the senses nourished, in
the same way only by worshipping Çré Bhagavän is everyoneworshipped.
Sukha-sädhya  (su-sukham ): The sädhana of kevala-bhakti
involves no difficulty as the paths of jïäna , yoga and so on
do; instead one experiences happiness. It is therefore calledsukha-sädhya , meaning that the final result, sädhya , is joy-
fully performed. The sädhana  of bhakti  can be performed
simply by engaging the senses such as the tongue and ear inchanting the sweet holy names of Kåñëa and by hearing aboutHis lélä, or merely by using tulasé leaves and a little water.
Prahläda Mahäräja also gave this instruction to the sons ofthe asuras : na hy acyutaà préëayato bahv-äyäsaù. To please
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, who is Acyuta, one does not have towork laboriously, ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  7.6.19).ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !513
While commenting on this çloka , Çréla Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura says, Although one has to endure greattroubles to maintain the family and make them happy, oneneed not undergo such trouble to please Çré Hari. BecauseHe is ever situated within the heart of everyone asAntaryämé, one need not undergo any trouble searching forHim. One can please Him at all times, in all circumstancesand in all respects, even by performing mänasa sevä  or by
following any one of the processes of bhakti  such as
çravaëam and kértanam , or just by desiring to perform ser-
vice. Thus, there is no pain involved in performing bhakti .
One experiences joy even while performing bhakti  in the
stage of sädhana.
taà sukhärädhyam åjubhir / ananya-çaraëair nåbhiù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  3.19.36
Çré Kåñëa is easily pleased by a person who has completely sur-
rendered and who is simple-hearted.
 It is also said in Gautaméya-T antra :
tulasé-dala-mätreëa / jalasya culukena vä
 vikåéëéte svam ätmänaà / bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsalaù
Bhagavän, who is bhakta-vatsala , completely sells Himself to
those bhaktas  who, with love and devotion, offer Him a tulasé
leaf and a palmful of water.
Akñaya-phala-prada (avyayam ): The processes of karma ,
jïäna  and yoga  are impermanent. After yielding perfection
(the goal), such processes become futile and are then aban-doned. However, bhakti  exists in the stages of both sädhana
and siddha , because bhakti  herself is not only the sädhana
but is also the sädhya (goal to be achieved). Even in the lib-
erated stage  bhakti  is not lost, but rather it is performed
purely and perfectly. Therefore, it is permanent and un-changing.2! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 514

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Arjuna may raise the following doubt: If this dharma is so
easily perfected, why do people remain in material existence?In response to this, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning
with açraddadhänäù.  The word asya means dharma  in the
form of bhakti. Açraddadhänäù puruñäù means people who
lack faith in this.
The superiority of bhakti  is established by the statements
of çästra , but those who are faithless consider such glorifica-
tion to be an exaggeration. They reject this dharma  due to
atheistic intelligence. Even if someone renounces the pathof bhakti and practises severe alternative measures to attain
Me, still he will not be successful. Instead, he will continu-ously wander on this path of material existence which ispervaded by death.ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !515
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Even after hearing and being acquainted with the glo-
ries of bhakti  as described here, some consider these glo-
ries to be an exaggeration and they do not develop faith
in bhakti . Such faithless persons who do not adopt
bhagavad-bhakti  are forced to take repeated births in this
material world . Çraddhä  (faith) is the root cause of bhakti .
One can only attain Bhagavän, who is bhakta-vatsala , by
bhakti . This is also confirmed in Caitanya-caritämåta
(Madhya-lélä  22.64): çraddhävän jana haya bhakti-adhikäré.
Those who are faithful are eligible for  bhakti.  Further-
more, it is said:
brahmäëòa bhramite kona bhägyavän jéva
guru-kåñëa-prasäde päya bhakti-latä-béja
Madhya-lélä  19.151
In the course of wandering throughout this universe, a rare jéva
who is extremely fortunate, obtains the seed of the creeper ofbhakti  by the mercy of Çré Gurudeva.
Çré Gurudeva infuses the desire to serve Çré Kåñëa into the
heart of the jévas. This desire is known as kåñëa-sevä-väsanä ,
and by it one attains päramärthika-çraddhä , transcendental
faith, which is the root cause  of bhakti . Those who are faith-
less and unfortunate do not take shelter of this path of bhakti
which has been established in all çästra . They try to attain
Çré Bhagavän by adopting other processes such as the per-formance of pious activities, jïäna , yoga  and tapasyä , but
their whimsical attempts go in vain. Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.12.9) states:
yaà na yogena säìkhyena / däna-vrata-tapo-dhvaraiù
vyäkhyä-svädhyäya-sannyäsaiù / präpnuyäd yatnavän api3! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 516
Even though one engages with great endeavour in mystic yoga ,
philosophical speculation, charity, vows, penances, ritualisticsacrifices, teaching Vedic mantras to others, personal study of
the Vedas , or the renounced order of life, still one cannot achieve
Me.
Furthermore, the essence of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté
Öhäkuras commentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.87.33) is
as follows: Those who abandon service to the lotus feet ofÇré Gurudeva, which is their primary support on the path ofbhakti , and who desire to subdue their minds by yoga or other
methods, are pursuing futile hopes. They fall down into theocean of material existence, which is full of obstacles andvarious types of calamities. Çré Bhagavän has also explainedthis topic in great detail in Bhagavad-gétä  (3.31 and 12.20).

Çré Bhagavän says, Only when bhakti  is in the mood of
däsya  (servitorship) do My bhaktas desire knowledge of My
aiçvarya . To explain this knowledge, Bhagavän is speaking
seven çlokas  starting here beginning with the word mayä . I
am the cause of this world, and I pervade it through Mysvarüpa  which is avyakta , unmanifest and beyond the senses.
Thus all moving and non-moving beings are situated in Me,who am the cause of everything and the complete consciousentity. Even so, because I am asaìga , aloof and unattached,
I am not situated in the created beings, unlike earth which ispresent in its effects (i.e. earthen objects such as pots).

Pariëäma : Milk is a pure substance. By contact with acid, it
turns to curd. This is called a transformation. Thus curd is apariëäma (effect or product) of milk when milk is transformed.
Vivartta:  To mistake one object for another is called vivartta .
Examples of vivartta are mistaking a rope for a snake, and
thinking that there is silver in an oyster.
The essence of Çré Kåñëas instruction lies herein. This
universe is not a pariëäma (transformation) of Me, nor is it
a vivartta  (illusion). I am the Absolute Self-effulgent Real-
ity. The jévas and the universe are also real; both are the
pariëäma of My çakti . The jévas are eternal and have come
into existence from the taöastha-çakti , but the material world,
which is born from My bahiraìga-çakti , is temporary and
subject to destruction even though it is real. The jévas and
the universe are transformations of My çakti , which is non-
different from Me; hence they are simultaneously one withand different from Me. This conception is acintya (incon-

the perception of difference is indeed stronger than the per-ception of oneness. Therefore, I am the Absolute ConsciousEntity, different from both the jéva as well as the universe.

Asaìga  means that, Although all beings and the

beginning with the word yathä  to give an example of this.
It is the nature of the wind to be always moving, thus it is
said to be sarva-ga , moving everywhere. It is described as
mighty ( mahän ), because its capacity is unlimited. Just asÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !521
the wind is situated in the sky which is by nature asaìga
(aloof or unmixed), it is simultaneously not situated in the
sky. Also because of the skys asaìga nature, it is not
situated in the wind, although it is situated in the wind.
Similarly, the païca-mahäbhüta  (five great elements) such
as the sky and air, which exist everywhere, are not in Me,
because My nature  is asaìga . They are not in Me although
they are situated in Me. Deliberate on this and try to

Arjuna may raise the following question: You said,
Behold My extraordinary yoga-aiçvarya ! How is the
inconceivable nature of Your yoga-aiçvarya  proved by this
example? In other words, if it can be explained by an
example, how is it inconceivable? In response to this
question, Bhagavän says, The sky, which is inert, is
asaìga , but among conscious beings it is not possible for
anyone other than Myself to be asaìga  even if they have
presided over the manifested creation. How can one who
creates remain untouched or aloof from creation? If it is
so, it is indeed extraordinary. This proves that He is
inconceivable. Here the example of the sky is given so that
common people may easily understand the siddhänta .

Arjuna out of His mercy.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Baddha-jévas cannot really understand this tattva , so to ex-

Themodern principle of evolution, introduced by Darwin, has nofoundation whatsoever, and is a completely mistaken belief.This is proven by the fact that, even after millions of yearsno superior form of human being has evolved, nor has anyother living entity evolved to surpass the human species.

is satya-svarüpa , the embodiment of truth. In other words, I
am parama-satya -svarüpa , the embodiment of the highest

Çré Kåñëa Caitanya Mahäprabhu instructed a resident
brähmaëa  of Käçé that Kåñëas form and Kåñëas name are
non-different. His name, form and nature are all sac-cid-
änanda  and are one in tattva . There is no difference between
His body and His self, His name ( näma ) and the possessor
of His name ( nämé ). Those who think that the sac-cid-
änanda  form of Kåñëa is material are offensive. Caitanya-
caritämåta  explains that amongst all of Çré Kåñëas pastimes,
His nara-lélä is topmost. His form in which He dresses as a
cowherd boy, carries a flute in His hand, and is a young boydressed like a dancer, is the most supreme and sweetest formof all.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, The
essence of My statements is that My svarüpa  is sac-cid-
änanda , and that My çakti  performs all actions by My mercy,
although I am independent from them. It is only by My mercythat I am visible in this mundane world, and this is just an
effect of My yogamäya-çakti . I am the complete transcen-
dental reality beyond all mundane rules and, even though Iam the personification of the conscious reality ( caitanya-
svarüpa ), I become visible in this material world by mani-
festing that very same svarüpa . But human beings, who are
atomic in size, have a tendency to be overawed by somethingthat is immense in size. Such is their conception of theunmanifest state of brahma . This is due to their conditioned
intelligence, but that form is not My paraà bhäva (supreme
nature). My paraà bhäva is that I am completely alaukika
(transcendental). Although My human -like form is of a
medium size, by My çakti  I am simultaneously all-pervad-
ing and smaller than the atom. My svarüpa  is manifested
by My acintya-çakti (yogamäyä ). Those who are foolish con-
sider that My transcendental sac-cid-änanda-mürti  to be hu-
man, and that I have been forced to accept this material bodyÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !533
by the laws of material nature. They are unable to understand
that I am the controller of all beings in this very svarüpa , this
beautiful transcendental human-like form. Therefore, becausethey have a misconception about transcendental reality(avidvat-pratéti ), they superimpose their limited understand-
ing on Me. However, those who have developed vidvat-pratéti
and who have proper access to transcendence can realise Mysvarüpa  as the ever-existing sac-cid-änanda-tattva .

What is the destination of those who deride Çré Bhagavän,
thinking that He has a human body made of mäyä ? An-

the result of their karma  such as Svarga. If they are jïänés ,
they cannot attain mokña  as a result of their jïäna. So what

Kåñëa, as described in the previous çloka . Their minds be-
come distracted and they remain attracted to an äsurika and
atheistic nature which destroys their discrimination, whatto speak of their desires, activities and knowledge which allbecome useless. Thus they fall from the path leading to thesupreme goal. This is explained in the Båhad-vaiñëava T antra :
yo vetti bhautikaà dehaà kåñëasya paramätmanaù

Those who consider the body of Çré Kåñëa to be made of the five
material elements are disqualified from performing all types ofkarma  according to the rules of çruti and s måti. It is recommended
that if one sees the faces of such sinful people, one should im-mediately take bath with his clothes on. It is äsurika  to remain
attached to that bewildering nature, full of the characteristicsof ignorance such as violence . It destroys their discrimination;
thus they go to the hellish planets.

sac-cid-änanda.  Such great personalities are very rare. This
principle has been confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä  (7.19). Such
great personalities are endowed with divine natures. Contraryto this, there are others with äsurika natures. It is said in the
Padma Puräëa : viñëu-bhaktaù småto daiva äsuräs tad-

You said that they engage in Your bhajana , but what is
that bhajana ? In answer to this question, Çré Bhagavän
speaks this çloka  beginning with the word satatam.  They
constantly perform My kértana in which, unlike karma -yoga,
there is no consideration of the purity or impurity of time,ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !537
place or person. Småti  (Viñëu-dharmottara ) says, For a per-
son who is attached to chanting the name of Çré Hari, thereis no rule regarding time or place. What to speak of chant-ing with a contaminated mouth, there is no restriction tochanting in any impure state. These great souls are yatantaù ,
which means that they endeavour with steadfast vows. Apoor householder, in order to maintain his family with hopesof gaining wealth, may endeavour to do so near a wealthyperson. Similarly, My bhaktas develop an attachment to
kértana , etc., in order to obtain bhakti , and endeavour in the
assembly of sädhus . And even after attaining bhakti , they
practise it again and again, just as one may revise the çästra
many times. Those who are steadfast and never break theirvow to chant a fixed number of names, who bow down a setnumber of times, who perform other such services regularlyand who fast on ekädaçé  are called yatnavän  or persons of
endeavour. They think, This practice is imperative for me.
In the phrase namasyantaç ca , the word ca means that all
other limbs of bhakti , such as çravaëam  and päda-sevanam ,
are also included in this. These great bhaktas  are called nitya-
yuktäù , meaning that they desire to obtain My eternal asso-
ciation. The import of the two phrases kértayanto mäm  and
mäm upäsate  in this çloka  is that only My kértana  and other
aìgas  (limbs) comprise My upäsanä (bhakti ). Therefore rep-
etition of the word mäm  is not a defect.

This çloka  explains how the great personalities who were
described in the previous çloka  worship Çré Kåñëa.  Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (6.3.22) states:  bhakti-yogo bhagavati / tan-
näma-grahaëädibhiù . They incessantly engage in the kértana
of My näma , rüpa , guëa  and lélä. It is stated in the Vaiñëava-

na deça-niyamo räjan / na käla-niyamas tathä
vidyate nätra sandeho / viñëor nämänu kértane
This bhakti , in the form of kértana , does not depend on the pu-
rity of time, place, or person.
The Skanda Puräëa states: cakräyudhasya nämäni sadä
sarvatra kértayet.  The name of Çré Hari, who carries a disc
in His hand, is to be chanted everywhere at all times.
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu confirms this in Çikñäñöakam :
kértanéyaù sadä hariù.
An ordinary person cannot become a mahätmä simply by
advertising himself or collecting votes. No one can become amahätmä by these processes. In this çloka , Çré Kåñëa Him-
self has given the svarüpa-lakñaëa  (intrinsic characteristic)
of a mahätmä . Those who are constantly engaged in hear-
ing, chanting and remembering the supremely pure name, formand pastimes of Çré Kåñëa, who is the ätmä of all ätmäs , are
called mahätmäs . Others, such as jïänés , yogés  and tapasvés
who engage in pious activities and those who considerBhagavän to be nirviçeña (featureless), niräkära  (impersonal)
and niùçaktika  (devoid of potency), are not addressed as
mahätmä in Bhagavad-gétä.  Any person in any äçrama , be he
a brahmacäré , a gåhastha  or a sannyäsé , can become a real
mahätmä by taking shelter of a bona fide guru  and by culti-
vating bhakti  to Çré Kåñëa .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Mahätmäs  who understand Me properly always glorify (per-
form kértana of) My näma , rüpa , guëa and lélä. That is, they
follow the nine types of bhakti (navadhä bhakti ), such as
hearing and chanting with determined vows in order to at-tain eternal service to My sac-cid-änanda  Çyämasundara
form. They become steady in all activities, whether bodily,mental, social or spiritual, solely to please Me. They surren-der to Me by the process of bhakti -yoga even while living inÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !539
this material world. This ensures that their minds do not
become disturbed by materialistic activities.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In this Chapter and in previous chapters only ananya-
bhaktas  have been referred to as mahätmäs.  It has been shown
that such bhaktas are superior to all other types of devotees
such as ärtta  (the distressed). Now Çré Bhagavän is speaking
about the other three types of bhaktas who were not described
earlier, and who fall into a different category. They are  ahaì-
graha upäsakas , those who identify themselves with the ob-
ject of worship; that is, they consider the jévas and Bhagavän
to be one. The pratéka upäsakäs  worship the devas consider-
ing them to be supreme,  but in fact those devas are simply15! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 540
vibhütis  of the Lord. The viçvarüpa upäsakas  worship the
universal or cosmic form of the Lord. None of them aremahätmäs  because they are unable to perform the sädhana
described previously ( Gétä 9.14).
The three meanings of jïäna-yajïa  are described in the
çrutis.
1) O Deva-puruña, Master of all aiçvarya ! Whatever You
are, I am the same as that, and whatever I am, You are alsothe same. This is ahaì-graha upäsanä  and some jïänés  en-
gage in the worship of Parameçvara by this type of yajïa .
Here, the word ca has been used to mean evam (also)  and
the word api has been used in the sense of giving up all other
processes. The word ekatvena  (oneness) means thinking that
the worshipper is one with the worshipable. In the T antra
it is said: nä devo devam arcayet.  One who is not a devatä
himself  cannot worship a devatä . Ahaì-graha upäsanä
means to worship Gopäla with the feeling, I am Gopäla.
2) Inferior to this type of worship is påthaktvena (wor-
ship in duality), in which the worshippers engage in yajïa
in the form of pratéka upäsanä.  Following the statements
in the çrutis , they think, The sun is brahma;  this alone is
the instruction. Those who have even less intelligence thanthese worship My universal form in various ways, consid-ering Me to be the ätmä  of everything. This is the expla-
nation of Çrépäda Madhusüdana Sarasvaté. Some worship-pers think that the Supreme Lord Viñëu is the sun, and thatthere is no sun other than Him; that He Himself is Indra,and there is no other Indra; and that He is Soma, and thereis no other Soma. This type of worship, in which thevibhütis  are seen as being Bhagavän in different forms, is
called pratéka upäsanä .
3) To worship all the vibhütis  with the knowledge that
Viñëu is everything is called viçvarüpa-upäsanä .ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !541
Jïäna-yajïa , therefore, has three divisions. Sometimes,
ekatvena (the oneness of the worshipper with the object of
worship) and påthaktvena (the worship of Çré Bhagaväns
vibhütis  as being different from Bhagavän) are placed in one
category because they are almost the same. For example, inahaì-graha upäsanä is the mentality that I am Gopäla, and
on the other hand the feeling that, I am the servant ofGopäla. These two types of feelings are likened to a riverthat is approaching the ocean. The river is different fromthe ocean, yet also non-different. The second category isviçvarüpa upäsanä . Jïäna-yajïa  is, therefore, of two types
when categorised in this way.

The superior and exalted postion of the ananya-bhaktas is
apparent when they are compared to those  bhaktas such as
ärtta  (the distressed). Ananya-bhaktas  can be addressed as
mahätmä . Having stated this, Çré Bhagavän explains three
other types of worshippers who are inferior to them. Thesethree types of worshippers are unable to perform the sädhana
of the ananya-bhaktas  so they worship Çré Bhagavän by the
yajïa of knowledge  endowed with guëé-bhütä bhakti (bhakti
which is predominated by karma , etc.), and they deliberate
on the reality of ekätvena (oneness), påthaktvena (difference,
duality) and bahudhä or viçvato mukham (the universal
form).
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, superior to those such as the ärtta-bhaktas are the
ananya-bhaktas  who are known as mahätmäs . I have ex-
plained the ärtta-bhaktas in various ways.  Now I will explain
the three types of bhaktas who are inferior to them, and whom
I have not yet mentioned. Learned scholars call these three
types of worshippers ahaì-graha upäsaka , pratéka upäsaka ,
and viçvarüpa upäsaka . Ahaì-graha upäsakas  are superior to15! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 542
the other two. They identify themselves as being one with
Bhagavän. This mentality, or egoism is one type of yajïa for
worshipping Parameçvara. The ahaì-graha upäsakas worship
brahma  while performing this yajïa with a conception of
oneness. Pratéka upäsakas are inferior to them. They think
of themselves as separate from Bhagavän and they worshipthe sun and Indra, etc., but without understanding that theyare only Çré Bhagaväns vibhütis.  Those who are even less
intelligent worship Çri Bhagavän in the form of viçvarüpa
(the universal form).Thus, jïäna-yajïa  is of three types.

Why do people worship You in various ways? Anticipat-
ing this question, in this and the next three çlokas , Çré
Bhagavän is giving a detailed explanation of His nature by
which He is everything within the universe . In other words,
He is describing His cosmic form. The word kratuù  means
yajïas  such as agniñöoma  which are prescribed in the Vedas ,
as well as yajïas such as vaiçva-deva  which are described in
the småti -çästra  of the smärtas . The word auñadham  means
the potency produced from the auñadhi , herbs which have
medicinal benefit. The word pitä signifies that because He is
the efficient material cause of the universe either individu-ally or collectively, He is therefore the father. The word mätä
means that, because He holds the universe in His womb, Heis the mother. He maintains the universe and nourishes it,therefore He is dhätä , the sustainer, and since He is the fa-
ther of Brahmä, who is the creator of this universe, He isthe grandfather. The word vedyam  means the object of
knowledge and pavitram  means that which purifies. The word
gati means fruit in the sense of result or destiny, either good
or bad, of our past and present actions. Bhartä  means the
husband or protector, prabhuù  means the controller, säkñé
means the witness of auspicious and inauspicious activities,and niväsaù  means the abode. Çaraëam  means one who de-
livers others from calamities and suhåt  means one who does
welfare work without any motive. Prabhavah means, Only
I perform the actions of creation, destruction and mainte-nance. Nidhänam  means, I am the treasure, being endowed
with padma , çaìkha , gadä  and cakra . The word béja means
the cause or seed. However, avyayam  means I am not per-
ishable like seeds of rice. I am imperishable, eternal and un-changing. I provide heat in the summer season in the formof the sun. I award the rains in the rainy season. I am ämåtaÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !545

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Only
when there is some scent of bhakti  in these three types of
worship will the jéva begin worshipping Me as Parameçvara.
He will gradually give up the impurities of mixed worship andattain mokña in the form of My çuddha-bhakti . If the wor-
shipper abandons the false conception of oneness withBhagavän as in the ahaì-graùa upäsanä  process, he can gradu-
ally attain çuddha-bhakti by properly deliberating on bhakti .
The idea in the pratéka upäsanä  process that other devas are
Bhagavän can also gradually culminate in realisation of Mysac-cid-änanda  svarüpa  of Çyämasundara, by deliberating on
tattva  in the association of sädhus . The unsteady knowledge
(worship) of Paramätmä in the process of viçvarüpa  upäsanä
can also be removed by gradually realising that the worshipof My svarüpa  is the most elevated. The worshipper can then
concentrate on My human-like sac-cid-änanda  feature.
But if a person who performs one of these three types of
worship persists in his attraction for karma  and jïäna ,
which is a symptom of his aversion to Me, he cannot at-
tain the all-auspicious  bhakti . Because of their aversion to
Me, those who worship oneness ( ahaì-graùa upäsaka )ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !547
gradually fall into the network of illusory mäyäväda  rea-

karma  prescribed in the Åg, Säma , and Yajur Vedas.  Hav-

instruction on karma , they become freed from sin by drink-

attain Svarga in the planets of the devas as a result of their
pious deeds. Thus they attain the divine pleasures of thedevas .

Those who desire material pleasures, as described in the

With their faith in the path of fruitive activity and being averse
to the dharma of the soul, which is bhagavad-ärädhanä  (worship
of Bhagavän), such persons are bewildered by material desiresand perform various types of yajïas to worship mortal devas and

The happiness of My bhaktas is not due to receiving the
fruit of karma , rather it is because it is granted by Me.
Nityäbhiyuktänäm  refers to those who are always united with
Me. The happiness of such paëòitas who are linked with Me
by bhakti is bestowed by Me. Those who are not paëòitas
are bereft of this knowledge of bhakti . Nityäbhiyuktänäm  also
means that I grant success in yoga, dhyäna  and so on to those
who always desire union with Me. Kñemam  means that even
if they are not expecting it, I Myself maintain them and carrytheir burden. Here Çré Bhagavän has not used the wordkaromi  which means I do, but He has used the word vahämi
which means I carry. This implies, I personally carry the
burden of maintaining their bodies, just as a householder car-ries the burden of maintaining his wife, son and other familymembers. Their yoga (progress) and kñema  (maintenance) are
not a result of the fruit of their karma , unlike others.22! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 550
What is the purpose behind You, Parameçvara, who are
always indifferent and self-satisfied, carrying their burden?(This appears to be contradictory because it is the bhaktas
duty to serve Parameçvara). As it is said in Gopäla-täpané
Upaniñad  (Eastern Division 15),  Bhakti  means devotional
service to Him, in which one gives up all kinds of designa-tions, be they material or transcendental, and absorbs themind only in Bhagavän. This is called naiñkarmya , freedom
from karma and its reactions. My ananya-bhaktas are
niñkäma  (selfless), and because of this selfless nature I be-
stow bliss upon them. I am neutral but I give this bliss to Mybhaktas because of My affection for them, thus I am called
bhakta-vatsala . Therefore, it is incorrect to say that those
bhaktas are lacking in love for Me because they give Me the
responsibility of their maintenance and nourishment. I will-ingly accept this responsibility even if they do not completelygive it to Me. This responsibility is not a burden for Me, who
am capable of creating all the universes merely by My will.
Furthermore, because I am attached to My bhaktas , it is a
great pleasure to carry their burden, just as it is a pleasurefor a man to carry the burden of maintaining a pleasing wife.

How does Çré Bhagavän carry the yoga-kñema  (progress and
maintenance) of His bhaktas ? In this regard a true story is
told.
Once, there was a poor brähmaëa  whose name was Arjuna
Miçra. He was a parama-bhakta of Çré Bhagavän. Every
morning after performing his bhajana , he spent two hours
writing a commentary on Çré Bhagavad-gétä  and then he
would go out to beg for alms. Whatever he received by beg-
ging he would give to his wife, who would prepare, cook and
offer the food to Çré Bhagavän with great love. She then gaveÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !551
the mahäprasäda  to her husband. Whatever was left over she
would eat with great satisfaction. They were very poor andall their clothes were torn. They only had one dhoté  that was
suitable to wear whenever they left the house. When thebrähmaëa  wore that dhoté  to go for alms, his wife covered
her body with some torn cloth, and when he returned, sheput on that same dhoté  to go outside or perform other house-
hold duties. They both considered their poverty to be a giftfrom Çré Bhagavän and were fully satisfied. They alwaysoffered whatever alms were collected by Bhagaväns mercyto their iñöa-deva , Çré Gopénätha, and later accepted His
mahäprasäda . This was their constant bhävanä (mood). Thus
their time passed blissfully and they were not the least dis-turbed by their situation.
In this way, the brähmaëa  regularly wrote his commentary
on Bhagavad-gétä.  One day, after performing his morning
bhajana  he sat down to write a commentary on the çloka :
ananyäç cintayanto mäà / ye janäù paryupäsate
teñäà nityäbhiyuktänäà / yoga-kñemaà vahämy aham
Gétä  9.22
Upon reading this, his mind became perplexed with a grave
doubt that he was unable to resolve in any way. Will thatPerson, Svayaà-Bhagavän, who is the only master of thewhole universe, Himself carry the yoga-kñema  (progress and
maintenance) of those who are engaged in His ananyä
bhajana ? No, this cannot be true. If this were so, then why is
my situation as it is? I am completely dependent on Him, andwith exclusive devotion, have offered everything unto Hislotus feet. Why then, do I have to undergo the misery ofpoverty? Therefore, this statement, nityäbhiyuktänäà yoga-
kñemaà vahämy aham , could not have been spoken by
Bhagavän Himself; it must have been interpolated. He tried22! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 552
to resolve this difficulty on the strength of his own intelli-
gence but instead he became more and more perplexed andhis doubt gradually increased. Finally, he put three slashmarks on this line with his red pen, stopped writing and wentout to beg alms.
Now, the most compassionate Bhagavän, who protects the
surrendered souls, saw that a doubt had appeared in the mindof His bhakta regarding His words. Taking the form of an
extremely beautiful, tender, black-coloured boy, He filled twobaskets with ample rice, däl, vegetables, ghee and so on and
putting them on either ends of a bamboo stick, He person-ally carried them on His shoulders to the house of thisbrähmaëa .
The door was locked from inside. First He knocked on the
door, and then loudly called, O mother, O mother! But thepoor brähmaëé was only wearing torn cloth, so how could
she come out? Out of shyness, she sat quietly but the knock-
ing and calling out continued. Finding no other alternative,
she shyly came out keeping her head lowered and finallyopened the door. Carrying that weight, the boy entered thecourtyard, placed His load on the floor and stood to one side.Çré Bhagavän, in the guise of that boy, spoke to her as fol-lows, Mother, Paëòitjé (the brähmaëa ) has sent these sup-
plies. Please take them inside.
Until now, the brähmaëé  had been standing with her face
lowered. Upon hearing the sweet words of the boy, she lookedup and saw in the courtyard two big baskets filled with food-stuffs. She had never seen so many vegetables and food grains.Being repeatedly requested by the boy to take them, she car-ried them to the inner part of the house. While doing so, sheconstantly gazed upon His beautiful face, and became com-pletely satisfied.  Aho, how beautiful His face is! How can a
person of such dark colour have such transcendental beauty?ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !553
She had never even imagined such beauty. Awestruck, she
stood transfixed. Her eyes then noticed that on the chest ofthe boy were three bleeding slash marks as if someone hadcut it with a sharp weapon. Her heart disturbed, she cried,O son! Which merciless person has made these cuts on Yourchest? Alas! Alas! Even a stone-hearted person would meltat the thought of making cuts on such soft limbs!
Çré Kåñëa, in the guise of the boy, said, Mother, while bring-
ing you these foodstuffs, I was delayed, so your husband him-self made these cuts on My chest.
Her eyes full of tears, the brähmaëé cried, What! He made
these cuts on your chest? Just let him come home and I willask him how he could have done such a merciless thing! Myson, dont feel distressed. Stay for some time. I will preparethis food and You also can accept the prasäda  of Öhäkurjé.
Seating the boy in the courtyard, the brähmaëé went to
the kitchen and started to prepare an offering. Kåñëa then
thought, The purpose for which I Myself carried these food-
stuffs has been completed. Now, when the brähmaëa  returns
to his house, he will immediately discover the authenticityof My words, and he will never doubt them again. In thisway, having made arrangements to dispel the doubts of Hisbhakta , Kåñëa disappeared.
That day, despite great effort, the brähmaëa  was unable
to collect any alms. Losing all hope, he returned home, think-ing that his inability to collect anything was the will ofÖhäkurjé. He knocked on the back door and his wife openedit. When he saw that she was busy cooking, he inquired, Howis it that you are cooking when I received no alms today?What can you cook with?
Why? Some time back you sent so much foodstuff in the
hands of that boy that it will take six months for both of usto finish it. Why are you asking me, What will you cook?22! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 554
She was a little surprised. And your heart is like stone. This
I did not know before. That boy had three red marks on Hischest. How could you slash the tender body of that boy? Haveyou no mercy?
The brähmaëa , completely amazed, asked her to explain.
I didnt send anything home nor did I beat a boy. I do notunderstand what you are talking about.
After hearing the statements of her husband, she showed
him the rice, däl, flour and other things, but when she en-
tered the courtyard to show him the boy and His cuts, theboy was not there. She began to search for Him everywhere.Where had He gone? The outside gate was closed as before.They both looked at each other in surprise. The brähmaëa
now began to understand the whole situation and tearsflowed continuously from his eyes. After washing his handsand feet he entered the Deity room and, to completely dis-pel his doubt, he opened his Bhagavad-gétä . That morning
he had made three slash marks with his red ink on the line:
nityäbhiyuktänäà yoga-kñemaà vahämy aham , but now
these three marks were gone. Overwhelmed with happiness,he came out of the Deity room crying. My dear, you are sofortunate! Today you have directly seen Çré Gopénätha! Andall these foodstuffs were brought personally by Him! Howcould I possibly have brought so much stock? This morn-ing, while writing my commentary on the Bhagavad-gétä , I
doubted the statements of Bhagavän and slashed thosewords with three lines of red ink. That is why the tenderchest of our Öhäkurjé, Gopénätha, was marked with cuts.He is supremely compassionate. He has taken so muchtrouble to prove the authenticity of His statements and toremove the doubts of an atheist like me.
Then, his throat choked up and he was unable to speak.
Overwhelmed with love, he cried out,  Hä Gopénätha!  Hä
Gopénätha! and fell to the ground. Standing in front of ÇréÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !555
Gopénätha, the eyes of his wife, who was struck dumb, filled
with tears. After some time the brähmaëa  returned to con-
sciousness and, after taking his bath, performed his dailyduties. He offered the preparations to Çré Gopénätha that hiswife had prepared and, with great love, they both acceptedHis remnants. He continued writing the commentary on Gétä
every day, and his life became full of love.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, You
should not think that these three types of upäsakas  (wor-
shippers) who have fruitive desires attain happiness andthat My bhaktas suffer. My bhaktas think of Me only, with-
out deviation. For the maintenance of their bodies theyaccept anything that is favourable to My bhakti and reject
all that is unfavourable. In this way, they are nitya-abhiyukta ,
or ever-united with Me by devotional love. Free from self-ish desires, they offer everything to Me only. I alone pro-vide all their wealth and any of their other requirements,
and thus I maintain them. The meaning is that, from an
external point of view, there may appear to be a similaritybetween materially-motivated pratéka upäsakas  and My
bhaktas who only accept that which is favourable to My
service. However, there is a big difference between the two.I carry the yoga  (progress) and kñema (maintenance) of My
bhaktas even if they have no mundane desires. The special
benefit My bhaktas receive is that by My mercy they enjoy
all sense objects in a dispassionate manner and finally theyattain eternal bliss. However, the pratéka upäsakas  again
return to the field of karma  after enjoying sense pleasure .
They do not attain eternal bliss. I am indifferent to allmundane occurences,  but out of affection for My bhaktas ,
I feel delight to help them in every respect. In My doingthis, there is no offence at all on the part of My bhaktas ,
because they do not pray to Me for anything except Myfavour. I Myself personally supply their requirements.22! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 556

The following doubt may be raised: In accordance with
the çloka of Bhagavad-gétä  9.15, jïäna-yajïena cäpy anye , You
said that worship of You is of three types. The statement,bahudhä viçvato-mukham , explains the third type, worship
of Your universal form. You revealed the nature of that formby statements such as, I am yajïa , I am the Vedic ritual, etc.
(Gétä 9.16-19). No devatä  exists independently from You; such
is the nature of the universal form. It can be concluded fromthis that those who worship devatäs  such  as Indra are, in fact,
worshipping You, so why will they not be liberated? Further-more, You have said that those who have material desiresbecome entangled in the cycle of birth and death ( Gétä  9.21)
and attain perishable results. Why is this so?
In response, Çré Bhagavän says, It is true that they wor-
ship Me, but they do so without following the prescribed rulesto attain Me. They therefore remain in the material world.ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !557
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The following point may be raised: The devatäs are
Bhagaväns vibhüti-svarüpa  (forms of opulence) and the limbs
of His body. It does not matter how those who worship the
devatäs  perform their worship, ultimately it reaches
Bhagavän. Those who worship the devas attain the planets
of those particular devas  and, after enjoying the perishable
fruits there, they return to this earthly plane. The unalloyedworshippers of Çré Bhagavän, however, do not return to thismaterial world after attaining sevä to Çré Bhagavän in His
dhäma , so if both types of worship are meant for Bhagavän,
why do their end results differ?
In response to this, Çré Kåñëa is explaining to Arjuna, The
devatäs are not separate from Me nor are they controllers
independent of Me. The worship of those who consider themas such is unauthorised.
This subject is also clearly explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(4.31.14):
yathä taror müla-niñecanena
tåpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaçäkhäù
präëopahäräc ca yathendriyäëäà
tathaiva sarvärhaëam acyutejyä
By properly watering the root of a tree, its trunk, branches, twigs,
leaves, flowers and so forth all become nourished, just as by eat-ing food the life air and the senses become nourished. In thesame way, by worshipping Bhagavän Acyuta everyone, includ-ing all the devas , are worshipped.
The essence of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkuras
commentary on this çloka  is that, by pouring water on the
root of a tree, its branches and sub-branches become nour-
ished, but the same result is not achieved by pouring water
on its leaves, branches, fruits and flowers. Somebody may23! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 558
say that there is no harm in giving water to the branches as
well as to the root of a tree; rather there is some benefit.Therefore, if one worships the devatäs along with worship-
ping Çré Kåñëa, then what is the harm? In response to thisanother example is given. The life air is sustained by supply-ing food to the stomach; thus all the bodys organs and sensesbecome nourished. However, if one gives food separately tothe ears, eyes and nose, then one will become deaf and blindand ultimately one will die. In the same way, by worship-ping the various devatäs , considering them independent gods,
one will only attain adverse results. The authorised process,therefore, is to exclusively worship Çré Bhagavän. Moreover,Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.40.9-10) says:
sarva eva yajanti tväà / sarva-deva-mayeçvaram
ye py anya-devatä-bhaktä / yady apy anya-dhiyaù prabho
yathädri-prabhavä nadyaù / parjanyäpüritäù prabho
viçanti sarvataù sindhuà / tadvat tväà gatayo ntataù
When reading these çlokas , most people will understand
them to mean, Just as rivers flowing from the mountainsbecome filled with rain water, divide into various branchesand enter the one ocean from various directions, in the sameway, the worship performed by those on various paths ulti-mately culminates in worship of Çré Bhagavän alone. Subse-quently, by worshipping other devas one will also receive the
result of worshipping Çré Kåñëa. However this understand-ing is not correct. The essence of Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkuras commentary on the above two çlokas  is as follows:
Karmés , yogés  and others actually worship Me only because
I alone am the embodiment of all the devas and the Supreme
Controller of all controllers. A person who thinks, I amworshipping Çiva, I am worshipping Sürya, I am worshippingGaneça, considering himself to be devoted to them, actuallyonly worships Me. However, if it is said that in this way theyÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !559
worship Me alone and as a result will surely attain Me, it is
not so. The worship performed by them certainly comes toMe, but the worshippers do not. The rivers flowing from themountains become full of rain water. The clouds pour forthwater all over the mountains and eventually this water takesthe form of rivers. All the rivers, flowing their independentcourses through different places, finally enter the ocean. Therivers coming from the mountains enter the ocean, but theirsource, the mountain, does not. In the same way, worshipperformed by persons practising various processes comes toMe alone. However, their source, the worshipper, does not.
Here, Çré Bhagavän is compared to the ocean, the Vedas  to
the clouds, the various types of processes of worship to thewater, the worshippers to the mountain and the variousdevatäs to the different places. Just as rivers pass through
various lands and enter the ocean, the worship of variousdevatäs comes to Çré Viñëu and, just as the mountain does
not reach the ocean, the worshipper of the devas  does not
reach Viñëu.
Ocean water evaporates to form rainclouds over the moun-
tains. Upon falling, that same water gathers as a river andpasses through different lands. It is known by different namesand finally it reaches the ocean. In the same way, the differ-ent types of worship as described in the çrutis  originally came
from Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa. They are performed by variousqualified persons to different devas  and they are known by
the names of those various types of worship . Their worship
finally comes to Çré Viñëu through the medium of the devas .
Through his worship a person only attains his ownworshipable deva, a temporary position. He does not attain
eternal sevä in the eternal dhäma of Çré Kåñëa.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, In
reality, I, the embodiment of sac-cid-änanda , am the only23! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 560
Parameçvara, Supreme Controller. There is no deva indepen-

Many persons worship devas , such as Sürya. In other words,
conditioned human beings in the material world give honourto the majestic feature of My mäyä-çakti  in the form of vari-
ous devatäs  and worship them. But by proper deliberation it
can be understood that My vibhütis , the devas , are simply My
guëa-avatäras . Those who worship these devas knowing their
actual position and the reality of My svarüpa , consider them
to be My guëa-avatäras. In this way,  their worship is
authorised and approved of as the progressive path. But thosewho worship the devas , thinking them to be eternal and in-
dependent of Me, worship in an unauthorised way which doesnot follow the prescribed rules, and so they do not achieveeternal results.

What is meant by the phrase without the prescribed
rules? In response to this question, Çré Bhagavän speaks thisçloka  beginning with ahaà hi.  In the form of various devas
I am the only enjoyer; I am the Lord and master and I amthe giver of results. Those who are pratéka upäsakas , how-
ever, do not know My tattva . For example, they think that
by worshipping Sürya, whom they see as Parameçvara, the
Supreme Controller, Sürya will be pleased with them andfulfil their desired results. They cannot understand with theirintelligence that Parameçvara, Çré Näräyaëa, has becomeSürya, and it is Çré Näräyaëa Himself who gives them suchfaith. Indeed, it is He who bestows the results of Sürya wor-ship. Hence, it is because of a lack of tattva-jïäna of Me that
they fall down. Those who understand that it is Çré Näräyaëaonly who is worshipped in the form of Sürya and the otherdevas , and who worship Me being conscious of My universal
existence, become liberated. Therefore, it is imperative forthose who worship My vibhütis , such as Sürya deva, to know
that they are actually My vibhütis. They are not to be wor-
shipped independently of Me. This is explained here.
S

Why is the worship of various devas improper? What is
the result of that unauthorised worship? This is being ex-plained in the present çloka . In the form of devas  such as
Indra, I alone am the enjoyer of all yajïas . I am the master,
maintainer, controller and bestower of the results of themall. Worshippers of the devas  do not know that the devas  are
My vibhütis; hence, they worship them with faith consider-
ing them to be independent of Me and the bestowers of theresults of their activities. Because they are unaware of Mytattva , they do not have faith in Me; therefore, this type of
worship is unauthorised. As a result of such unauthorised24! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 562
worship, they fall away from the truth and remain entangled
in the cycle of birth and death.
However, by worshipping devas such as Sürya, consider-
ing them to be My vibhüti , they gradually ascend the pro-
gressive path and, by the mercy of My bhaktas who know
My tattva , they come to understand the science of My
svarüpa.  Thus, their intelligence becomes exclusively fixed
on Me, Kåñëa, whose svarüpa is sac-cid-änanda .
This siddhänta  is also verified in the çrutis :
näräyaëäd brahmä jäyate
näräyaëäd indro jäyate
näräyaëäd dvädaçädityä rudrä
sarva-devatä sarva åñäyaù
sarväëi bhutäni näräyaëad eva
samutpadyate näräyaëe pratéyante
Brahmä is born from Çré Näräyaëa, Indra is born from Çré
Näräyaëa, Çiva is born from Çré Näräyaëa, all the devatäs and all
living entities are also born from Çré Näräyaëa. When their uni-versal duties are complete and they die, all will again merge intoÇré Näräyaëa.
The småtis  have also established the same conclusion:
brahmä çambhus tathaivärkaù candramäç ca çatakratuù
evam ädyäs tathaivänye yuktä vaiñëava-tejasä
jagat tu viyujyante ca tejasä käryävasäne
vitejasaç ca te sarve païcatvam upyänti te
Brahmä, Çiva, as well as the sun god, the moon god, Indradeva
and other powerful personalities empowered by Çré Viñëu, areforced to give up all those powers when they die.
This conclusion is also seen in other Upaniñads . The above
statements from çruti and småti  indicate a difference between
the devas and Çré Viñëu, who is the Supreme ControllerÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !563
(sarveçvareçvara ). The supremacy of Çré Viñëu over other
devas  is established in çruti and småti , yet somewhere in them
it is said that a particular deva is equal to Çré Viñëu. This
statement is made either because the influence of a particu-lar deva is under the control of Çré Viñëu, or because the deva
is very dear to Him.
If one concludes from this that it is proper to worship all
devas , considering them to be Näräyaëa, then it is to be
understood that everyone is generated from Näräyaëa, byHim they exist and in Him they are annihilated or dissolved.None of them are Näräyaëa, nor can they ever becomeNäräyaëa. It has been stated in çästra  that it is a grievous
offence to equate the devas or jévas with Çré Bhagavän. Such
offenders are called päñandés  (atheists).
yas tu näräyaëaà devaà / brahma-rudrädi-daivataiù
samatvenaiva vékñeta / sa päñaëòé bhaved dhruvam
Padma Puräëa
Just as it is improper to worship the devatäs with the understand-
ing that they are independent lords, it is also atheistic to equatethe devas (jévas) with Lord Näräyaëa.
Therefore, it is prescribed that the viçvarüpa upäsakas  (wor-
shippers of the universal form) should worship the devas as
the vibhüti  of Çré Näräyaëa. In this regard, çästra  makes two
types of statements. It is said in Närada-païcarätra :
antaryämi-bhagavad-dåñöyaiva sarv-ärädhanaà vihitam. All
are to be worshipped with the vision that Antaryämé, theall-pervading Lord, is dwelling within them.
And the Viñëu-yämala  states:
viñëu-pädodakenaiva pitåëäà tarpaëa kriyä
viñëor niveditännena yañöavyaà
devätäntaram ädi-prakäreëa vihitam iti24! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 564
It is with the foot water of Çré Viñëu that one should perform
activities such as offering oblations to the forefathers, and it iswith the remnants of Çré Viñëus foodstuffs that one should pleasethe devas .

Various rules and regulations have been prescribed for the
worship of the different devatäs , and the Vaiñëavas  worship
Viñëu by a similar process, according to the injunctions ofçästra . One may question, What is the defect in this deva
worship? To clear up this doubt, Çré Bhagavän says, It istrue; they worship the devas according to the rules for their
worship. As a result, such devatä-bhaktas  achieve those
devatäs . This is the principle. To explain this point, Bhagavän
speaks this ç loka beginning with the words yänti deva.  If
those devas  themselves are perishable, how can their bhaktasÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !565
become imperishable? But I am imperishable and eternal,
therefore, My bhaktas are also imperishable and eternal.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.3.25) also verifies this point: bhavän
ekaù çiñyate çeña-saàjïaù. After the devastation only You
remain, therefore You are called Ananta. Moreover, theçrutis  state: eko näräyaëa eväsén na brahmä na ca çaìkaraù.
In the beginning there was only Näräyaëa, not Brahmä orÇiva.
Also in the  Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad it is said:  parärddhänte
so budhyata gopa-rüpä me purastäd avirbabhüva. At the end
of the first half of Brahmäs life, he understood that I hadappeared before him in the form of a cowherd boy.
The çrutis  also state: na cyavante ca mad-bhaktä mahatyäà
pralayäd api.  My bhaktas continue to exist even at the time
of the great dissolution, that is, they do not take birth again.

Here, Çré Bhagavän is showing the difference between those
who worship the devatäs and those who worship Him (His
bhaktas ). He is also showing the difference in the results
attained by both. Some may say, Just as the Vaiñëavas  wor-
ship Viñëu according to the process described in çästra , we
are worshipping the devatäs according to the rules of çästra.
How, then, is our worship considered incorrect?
In answer to this Bhagavän says, According to  çästra , a
person will only have realisation to the extent that the per-sonality whom he worships has realisation. This is just. Theworshippers of the devas therefore, attain the planets of the
devas. Because both the devas and their planets are perish-
able, their worshippers achieve perishable results. On thecontrary, both My dhäma and I Myself are sac-cid-änanda ,
eternal, cognisant and blissful; therefore, those who worship
Me achieve blissful service to Me in My eternal dhäma . It is25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 566
also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.27): sama-çélä bhajanti ,
that those who worship the devas (such as Indra) perform
yajïas such as darça -paurëamäsya-yajïa  that are in sattva-
guëa.  Those who worship the forefathers do so by çräddha
and other ceremonies, which are in rajo-guëa , and those who
worship spirits, yakñas  (ghosts), räkñasas  and vinäyakas  (ele-
ments which create obstacles for others) worship by the pro-cess of bali or offerings, which is in tamo-guëa . My bhaktas ,
who are nirguëa , worship Me with devotion  using natural
and easily available objects.
Someone may say, Those who worship the devas also have
faith in You, because the sarva-deva-püjä  (worship of all the
devas ) also includes the worship of Näräyaëa. Bhagavän says
in response, The purpose of worshipping Näräyaëa in sarva-
deva-püjä , is simply so that the worshippers can perfect their
worship. Factually, they have no faith in Näräyaëa. Thosewho worship the devas think as follows: I am a worshipper
of Indra and other devas . They are my worshipable gods and
they themselves will fulfil my desires, being satisfied with myworship. Contrary to this, My bhaktas think, I am a wor-
shipper of Çré Väsudeva who is the omnipotent SupremeController. He alone is my worshipable Lord, and only forHis pleasure am I worshipping Him with various offeringsaccording to His liking. Being pleased, He will fulfil my de-sires. Externally, both types of worship appear to be equal,but, because those who worship the devas are averse to My
bhakti , they attain only limited enjoyment on the planets of
those devas.  After enjoying there, they again fall to this
earthly plane of existence. My ananya-bhaktas , however,
attain service to My sac-cid-änanda  form in My eternal
dhäma and do not return to this material world again. They
remain absorbed in My loving pastimes, experiencing unlim-ited happiness in My association.ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !567

There is often much misery in deva worship, but such pain
does not exist in the performance of bhakti  to Me, and it can
also be performed with ease. Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka
beginning with the word patram  to explain this point . It is
described here that it is the bhakti of the devotee which
causes Bhagavän to accept his offerings. The word bhaktyä
has been used in the second line and also again in the thirdline in the word bhakty-upahåtam . Thus there is repetition.
According to the rules of Sanskrit grammar, the word bhaktyä
in the third case implies those who are endowed with bhakti ,
that is, My bhaktas . So it emphasises, If someone other than
My bhakta  offers Me fruits or flowers with superficial devo-
tion, I do not accept it, but I accept ( açnämi ) whatever My
bhaktas give Me, be it even a leaf. In other words, I fully enjoy
that which is offered to Me with bhakti , but I do not enjoy
the offering of someone who has been forced to do it. But if26! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 568
the body of My bhakta is impure, I do not accept his offer-
ing. Therefore, Bhagavän says prayatätmanaù , meaning he
whose body is pure. From this statement it is concluded thata woman is forbidden to make an offering during her monthlymenstrual cycle. Another meaning of the wordprayatätmanaù  is, I accept the offerings of those whose hearts
are pure. Other than My bhaktas , no ones heart is pure.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.8.6) Parékñit Mahäräja says,
Those who are pure-hearted never give up the lotus feet ofÇré Kåñëa. The symptom of a person who has a pure heartis that he is unable to give up service to the lotus feet ofBhagavän. Therefore, if such a  bhakta  is sometimes seen to
possess lust or anger, it should be understood that he cannotdo any harm to others. He is likened to a snake whose poi-sonous fangs have been removed.

Having explained the imperishable and unlimited nature
of the result of bhagavad-bhajana , Bhagavän is now explain-
ing the quality of bhagavad-bhajana , which is easy to per-
form. When some easily attainable object such as a leaf,flower, fruit, or water is offered to Bhagavän with bhakti ,
then He accepts it thoroughly, although He is endowed withunlimited opulence and is perfectly satisfied. He becomeshungry and thirsty because of His bhaktas love for Him and,
absorbed in a mood of bhakti , He eats that offering out of
prema . At the house of bhakta Vidura, Çré Kåñëa, with great
prema , even ate banana peels from the hands of Viduras wife.
While eating the dry rice that His dear friend Sudämä Viprabrought and offered with prema , Çré Kåñëa said:
patraà puñpaà phalaà toyaà / yo me bhaktyä prayacchati
tad ahaà bhakty-upahåtam / açnämi prayatätmanaù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  10.81.4ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !569
The preparation may be delicious or not, but if it is offered with
love and a feeling that it is very delicious, it becomes most deli-cious to Me. At that time, I give up all other thoughts and relishit. Even if such a fruit or flower has no taste or fragrance, I ac-cept it, being captivated by My bhaktas prema .
One may ask if Kåñëa accepts that article which is offered
to Him with bhakti  by those who worship the devas . In re-
sponse, He says, No. I only accept whatever My bhaktas give
Me, not items offered by others.
The åövik priests in the sacrifice of King Näbhi spoke to
Çré Bhagavän, who appeared there:
parijanänuräga-viracita-çabala-saàçabda-salila-
sita-kisalaya-tulasikä-dürväìkurair api sambhåtayä
saparyayä kila parama parituñyasi
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  5.3.6
You certainly become especially pleased by the worship offered
by Your bhaktas who are full of anuräga for You, who offer prayers
with choked voices and who perform püjä to You with water, tulasé
leaves and sprouting durvä grass.
A similar statement from Gautaméya-tantra  in Hari-bhakti-
viläsa  states:
tulasé-dala-mätreëa jalasya culukena vä
vikåéëéte svam ätmänaà bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsalaù
Bhagavän, who is bhakta-vatsala , completely sells Himself to
those bhaktas  who, with love and devotion, offer Him a tulasé
leaf and a palmful of water.
While eating a morsel of dry rice from the begging bag of
the bhakta , Çuklämbara Brahmacäré, Çré Caitanya
Mahäprabhu said:
prabhu bale tora khüdkaëa mui khäüà
abhaktera amåta ulaöi nä cäüà26! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 570
O Çuklämbara, I am accepting this dry rice from you, but I do
not even look at ambrosial food that is offered by a non-devo-tee.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (4.31.21), Devaåñi Närada also told
the Pracetäs: na bhajati kumanéñiëäà sa éjya. Çré Hari never
accepts the service of ill-minded people who, intoxicated bytheir scholarship, wealth or high birth, disrespect His bhaktas
who perform ananyä sevä to Him.
Çré Kåñëa personally gave a similar instruction to Uddhava:
Even the gifts given to Me in profusion by non-devotees donot satisfy Me. Furthermore, to clarify this siddhänta , the
Lord told Sudämä:
aëv apy upähåtaà bhaktaiù / premëä bhüry eva me bhavet
bhüry apy abhaktopahåtaà / na me toñäya kalpate
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  10.81.3
If My bhakta gives Me the smallest offering, I consider it ex-
tremely great, but if non-devotees give Me elaborate offerings,they cannot satisfy Me.
Here, the word prayatätmä  means one who has purified
his heart by bhakti . Çré Bhagavän eats the foodstuffs of-
fered with préti by such pure-hearted bhaktas , but He does
not eat foodstuffs given by others. Prahläda Mahäräja hasalso made a similar statement: iti puàsärpitä viñëor
arpitaiva saté yadi kriyate. The performance of hearing,
chanting and so on is çuddha-bhakti only if a person has
fully surrendered himself at the lotus feet of Bhagavän,not otherwise.
The purport is that only when the limbs of bhakti  are
performed with complete surrender can the heart becomepurified. Çré Bhagavän lovingly accepts only the offeringsof such bhaktas .ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !571

Arjuna may ask the following question: Up until now, You
have explained various types of bhakti  from the çloka : ärtto
jijïäsur arthärthé jïäné (Gétä 7.16) . Which one of them should
I follow?
To remove Arjunas doubt, Çré Bhagavän says, O Arjuna,
at present you are unable to give up karma , jïäna and so on,
and therefore you do not have the adhikära  to perform the
topmost bhakti , namely kevalä or ananya-bhakti . And you do
not need to perform the inferior sakäma -bhakti  because your
adhikära  is higher than that. Therefore, you should perform
niñkäma-karma -jïäna-miçrä pradhäné-bhütä bhakti , or bhakti
(which is predominating) mixed with niñkäma-karma and
jïäna . For this reason, Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka
beginning with the words yat karoñi and also the next çloka.
Whatever mundane or Vedic activities you perform as nor-mal routine, whatever food or water you take daily, and what-27! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 572
ever austerities you may perform, you should maintain the
understanding that all of them can be offered to Me. This,however, is neither niñkäma -karma -yoga  nor bhakti -yoga .
Those who are devoted to niñkäma-karma-yoga  offer to
Bhagavän only those actions prescribed in çästra , not the nor-
mal activities of day-to-day life. This is more common. Butbhaktas offer every function of the senses along with their soul,
mind and life air unto their worshipable Lord. As it is said ina description of bhakti  in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.36): What-
ever activities a bhakta performs with his body, speech, mind,
senses, intelligence and ätmä , or by dint of his own nature, are
all offered to the transcendental Çré Näräyaëa. The follow-ing question may be raised: If juhoñi  (the performance of yajïa )
is the same as arcana (a limb of bhakti ), which is performed
for the purpose of satisfying Çré Viñëu, and if tapasyä  is to
perform the ekädaçé  fast, then why are they not considered
ananya-bhakti?  In response Bhagavän says, This is all right,
but actions in ananya-bhakti  are not offered to Bhagavän after
they have been performed; rather, a person first offers them toHim and then performs the act. As Prahläda Mahäräja said:
çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù / smaraëaà päda-sevanam
arcanaà vandanaà däsyaà / sakhyam ätma-nivedanam
iti puàsärpitä viñëau / bhaktiç cen nava-lakñaëä
kriyeta bhagavaty addhä / tan manye dhétam uttamam
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  7.5.23-24
Here it is evident that bhakti  is performed while first of-
fering these activities to Him, not that the activities are of-fered after they are performed. In his explanation of this çloka ,
Çréla Çrédhara Svämipäda says that bhakti  to Viñëu is per-
formed while offering these activities to Him, not that theacts are offered after they have been performed. Therefore,the present Gétä çloka  does not culminate in kevala-bhakti .ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !573

For those who are unable to take shelter of the most supe-
rior ananya-bhakti , as described by Bhagavän, and also for
those who do not have a taste for performing a lower class
of bhakti , Çré Bhagavän is instructing His dear friend Arjuna,
whom He is using as an instrument to teach humanity, toadopt niñkäma-karma-jïäna-miçrä pradhäné-bhütä bhakti , in
which all actions are offered to Him.
When Kåñëa says, Whatever actions you perform, be they
laukika  (mundane) or Vedic, offer them to Me, a person
should not wrongly think that he can perform any activityand eat and drink whatever he likes without there being anydefect, as long as it is offered to Bhagavän. Just because hefeels obliged to offer all actions unto the lotus feet ofBhagavän, does not mean that they will be successful. Nordoes it mean that an act prescribed in the Vedas , to which-
ever deva or with whatever desire, will in the end be offered
merely by saying the mantra , çré kåñëäya samarpaëam astu ,
like the smärtas  who are engaged in mundane activities. For
this reason, all commentators on this çloka  like Çréla Çrédhara
Svämé have explained the deep meaning: one should act insuch a way that all of his activities are offered directly toÇré Bhagavän. In other words, only those actions which areperformed for His pleasure should be offered. In Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (1.5.36) Devaåñi  Närada also says: kurväëä yatra
karmäëi bhagavac-chikñayä. The çaraëägata-bhaktas , who
perform pleasing acts for Bhagavän, offer those acts solelyto Him.
While commenting on this çloka , Çré Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura shows the difference between the ac-tivities of a karmé  and those of a bhakta.  A karmé only of-
fers Bhagavän the activities that are in accordance with Vedicinjunction so that his karma  will not be fruitless. Bhaktas ,27! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 574
however, perform all their activities, whether laukika , Vedic,
or related to the body, with the feeling that Bhagavän is mymaster, and it is for His pleasure that I am offering every-thing unto His feet. This is the great difference between thetwo.
This conclusion has also been confirmed in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.2.36) in the dialogue of the Nava-

In accordance with the particular nature that one has acquired
in conditioned life, whatever one does with body, words, mind,
senses, intelligence or purified consciousness, one should offerto the Supreme, thinking that this is for the pleasure of Çré
Näräyaëa.
While commenting on this çloka , Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta
Sarasvaté Prabhupäda writes: The activities of a bhakta  are
performed with body, mind, speech, intelligence, false ego,heart and all the senses, but they should not be compared tothe dharmika  acts of karmés  which are performed for their
own enjoyment. As a result of offering ones actions to Kåñëaas described above, ones aversion towards Him is graduallyremoved. Jévas  who are situated in their svarüpa  perform all
their actions only for the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If somepious karmés  who have spiritual good-fortune follow the ideals
of bhaktas  in a bona fide sampradäya and offer all their ac-
tivities unto the lotus feet of Çré Bhagavän, they quickly riseabove karma-miçrä bhakti  and are counted among the
bhaktas .ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !575
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, now ascertain your own qualification. You are en-gaged in assisting Me in My pastimes, having descended withMe as a dharma-véra  (righteous hero); therefore, you can
neither be counted among the nirapekña  (indifferent, çänta )
bhaktas nor the sakäma-bhaktas . You will only perform that
bhakti  which is mixed with niñkäma-karma  and jïäna.  It is,
therefore, your duty to offer Me whatever austerities andother activities you perform. The conception of the materi-alists is to perform an act with material desires and then offerthe activity to Me simply as a remnant. This conception isempty and useless. You should offer the action in the rightway at its inception and thus perform niñkäma-karma-jïäna-
miçrä bhakti .

In this way, you will become free from the bondage of
karma  and its unlimited good and bad results. Çré Gopäla-
täpané Upaniñad states:  Kåñëa-bhajana  is bhakti . By this
bhakti  one becomes free from worldly ( laukika ) as well as
higher celestial ( päralaukika ) designations. In other words,
one becomes free from desiring the fruits of ones activitiesand fixes ones mind only in bhajana  to Çré Kåñëa. This is
called naiñkarmya , and, therefore, to give up the result of
karma  is certainly sannyäsa . Those whose ätmä (mind) is fixed
in such yoga are yoga-yuktätmä . When gifted with this yoga,
you will not merely be liberated, mukta , but you will be
vimukta , a distinguished person even among the liberated
souls and you will come to Me to engage in My direct ser-vice.
O mahämuni , among millions of liberated and perfected
beings, a peaceful devotee  of Lord Näräyaëa is most rare
(Çrémad-Bhägavatam  6.14.5). And furthermore, The Lord can
give mukti but He rarely gives bhakti  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam
5.6.18). From this statement of Çukadeva Gosvämé, it is un-derstood that direct service to Bhagavän with prema  is supe-

Arjuna may say, O Kåñëa, You bring only Your bhaktas near
You by liberating them, but You do not bring the non-devo-tees. This means that You are also partial, since this is anexpression of attachment and envy. In response, ÇréBhagavän speaks this çloka beginning with samo ham , in
which He says, No, no, I am equal to all. The bhaktas live
in Me and I also live in them. According to this explana-tion, the whole universe is in Bhagavän and Bhagavän is alsoin the whole universe. He shows no partiality by doing this.The statement ( Gétä  4.11), ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs
tathaiva bhajämy aham means, I reciprocate with the con-
sciousness with which one surrenders to Me and also wor-ship him accordingly; and in whichever way the bhaktas are
attached to Me, I, who exist in them, am similarly attached tothem. This should be understood. In this regard, the ex ample29! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 578
of a wish-fulfilling tree can be given. Those who desire the
trees fruit take shelter of it, but in reality they are not at-tached to the tree at all; they are only attached to its fruit.Moreover, the wish-fulfilling tree does not become attachedto those who take its shelter, nor does it hate those who haveenmity towards it. Yet Bhagavän kills the enemies of Hisbhaktas with His own hands. As Bhagavän said while speak-
ing about Prahläda, When Hiraëyakaçipu acts inimicallytowards Prahläda, I will certainly destroy him even thoughhe has become powerful by the boons of Brahmä. Somecommentators give a different explanation of the word tu in
this çloka.  This partiality in the form of bhakta-vätsalya  is
always an ornament, not a defect. In this way, Kåñëasbhakta-vätsalya is well known, not His vätsalya  for a jïäné
or yogé. Just as it is natural for a person to be affectionately
inclined to his own servant and not to the servants of oth-ers, Bhagavän has affection for His bhaktas and not for the
devotees of Rudra or Durgä Devé.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The following objection may be raised: By giving special
liberation to His bhaktas , Bhagavän  bestows upon them the
prema-mayé sevä  of His lotus feet, but He does not behave
like this with the non-devotees. Is this not symptomatic ofthe defect of partiality, which arises from attachment andenvy? In response to this, it is stated that He has equal vi-sion. He does not hate anybody nor is anyone dear to Him.He creates and maintains humans and other living beingsaccording to their karma . Somebody may say that while
maintaining the jévas  according to their karma , He gives
happiness to one, misery to someone else and mokña to an-
other, so does this not indicate the defect of partiality aris-
ing from attachment and envy? The answer to this is foundin Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (6.17.22) wherein it is said:ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !579
na tasya kaçcid dayitaù pratépo
na jïäti-bandhur na paro na ca svaù
samasya sarvatra niraïjanasya
sukhe na rägaù kuta eva roñaù
He is equal to all living beings. There is nobody who is dear or
not dear to Him. Since a detached person has no attraction tosense pleasure, how can he become angry when his sense plea-sure is disturbed?
This is also seen in the next çloka  of Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(6.17.23):
tathäpi tac-chakti-visarga eñäà
sukhäya duùkhäya hitähitäya
bandhäya mokñäya ca måtyu-janmanoù
çarériëäà saàsåtaye vakalpate
Although Çré Kåñëa is the original performer of action, He Him-
self is not the cause of the jévas happiness, distress, bondage and
liberation. It is only guëa-mäyä  which governs the karmic re-
sults of the jévas sin and piety and becomes the cause of the jévas
birth and death, happiness and distress.
Because there is no difference between the energy and the
energetic, it is true that the activities of His mäyä-çakti  will
also be seen as His own work. Yet one cannot attribute thedefect of partiality to Him, because the results a jéva receives
for his actions are in accordance with his own karma . While
commenting on this çloka , Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté
Öhäkura gives the example of the sun and the owl. The sun-light is miserable for the owl, the kumuda  flower and cer-
tain other entities, but it is pleasing for the cakraväka  bird
and the lotus flower. One cannot accuse the sun of havingthe defect of partiality. In the same way, Bhagaväns mäyä
awards results according to the jévas  actions. One cannot
attribute to Him the defect of partiality because of this. In29! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 580
this context, one should also deliberate upon the following
çloka  from Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (8.5.22):
na yasya vadhyo na ca rakñaëéyo
nopekñaëéyädaraëéya-pakñaù
athäpi sarga-sthiti-saàyamärthaà
dhatte rajaù-sattva-tamäàsi käle
For Çré Bhagavän, there is no one to be killed, no one to be pro-
tected, no one to be neglected and no one to be worshiped.Nonetheless, for the sake of creation, maintenance and annihi-lation according to a specific time, He accepts different formsin either sattva , rajo or tamo guëa.
This is Bhagaväns general principle for all jévas, but in
the present Gétä çloka  He explains a special principle by
the word tu. Those who follow the limbs of bhakti  such as
çravaëam and kértanam  and engage in My  bhajana  are ex-
tremely attached to Me and become situated in Me. And I,who am the Supreme Controller, also become situated inthem with devotion.  According to the principle of a gem
and gold, the gem  produces the gold . Similarly, by the grace
of Bhagavän, bhakti  appears in ones heart. Bhagavän also
has devotion to His  bhaktas . As Çukadeva Gosvämé says in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.86.59): bhagavän bhakta-
bhaktimän.  The Supreme Lord is devoted to His bhaktas.
It is also stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (8.16.14): tathäpi
bhaktaà bhajate maheçvaraù. In the same way that bhaktas
are attached to Maheçvara Kåñëa, He is also attached toHis bhaktas.  This is the special quality of mutual love. It
is written in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.55): visåjati hådayaà
na yasya säkñäd. Such premé-bhaktas who have tied Kåsëas
lotus feet with the ropes of love are never given up by Him.This çloka  describes that, just as their relationship of the
heart is mentioned, their external relationship is also es-tablished. This relationship is confirmed in Ädi Puräëa :ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !581
asmäkaà guravo bhaktä bhaktänäà guravo vayam mad-
bhaktä yatra gacchanti tatra gacchämi pärthiva.  Bhagavän
says,  Bhaktas are My guru ; and I am the guru for the
bhaktas.  Wherever the bhaktas  go, I also go there.
A wish-fulfilling tree gives results according to the mood
of those who have taken its shelter and does not give resultsto those who have not taken its shelter. In the same way, al-though He is impartial, Bhagavän differentiates betweenthose who take His shelter and those who do not by givingthem different results. The speciality of Çré Kåñëa over andbeyond the wish-fulfilling tree is that the wish-fulfilling treedoes not become subordinate to those who take its shelter,whereas Kåñëa becomes subordinate to His bhaktas . There-
fore, one can only see the qualities of friendship, hatred andindifference in Him in relationship to bhakti . Well-known
examples are His friendly relationship with AmbaréñaMahäräja and His indifference toward Durväsä and others
who were envious. It is a fact that Çré Kåñëa is equal to all,
but what is more important is that He favours His bhaktas .
Of all His qualities, this particular quality is a special orna-ment. Çrémad-Bhägavatam , Bhagavad-gétä  and other çästras
give evidence of this.

My attachment for My bhakta is natural and, even if his
behaviour is degraded, My attachment for him is not lostand I make him supremely righteous. For this reason, ÇréBhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the words api
cet. Suduräcäraù  means that even if he is addicted to kill-
ing others, having illicit relations with women, and beingattached to others wealth, if he engages in My bhajana ,
he is surely saintly. What type of bhajana  must he perform?
In answer to this Bhagavän says: ananya-bhäk. He is a
sädhu  who does not worship any devatä  but only worships
Me, who does not engage in any  karma and jïäna  but only
engages in bhakti to Me,  and who does not desire any hap-
piness such as the attainment of a kingdom but only de-sires to attain Me. But where is the question of his beinga sädhu  if some type of bad behaviour is visible in him? In
response, Bhagavän says: mantavyaù . He must be consid-
ered a sädhu . From the word mantavyaù , the following in-
junction is indicated: There is a flaw in that person whodoes not consider him to be a sädhu.  In this regard, My order
alone is authoritative.
If a person who engages in Your bhajana  is also poorly
behaved, can he be considered a partial sädhu ? In response,
Çré Bhagavän says: eva. He is to be considered a complete
sädhu . One should not see that he lacks any saintly quali-
ties because he has made a staunch resolve  (samyag
vyavasitaù ). His resolve is as follows: Due to my sins,
whether I go to hell or degrade to a bird or animal species,I will never give up aikäntika-bhakti to Çré Kåñëa.ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !583
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the present çloka , Bhagavän, who is bhakta-vatsala , is ex-
plaining the inconceivable power of His bhakti  by making a
declaration. Even if My bhakta is seen to be engaged in an
abominable act, I will very quickly make him an exalted personwhose behaviour is good. There is no possibility of bad behaviourin such perfect persons who take shelter of My ananya-bhakti .
Even if they appear to be badly behaved in the eyes of theignorant, in reality they are not. In fact, they are definitelysaintly. What to speak of the ignorant, even big scholars can-not understand the actions and moods of the Vaiñëavas. Itis said in Caitanya-caritämåta : vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïe
nä bujhaya.  It is not possible to understand the behaviour
of uttama-adhikäré bhaktas  with ones material senses.
While warning a brähmaëa resident of Navadvépa not to
disrespect Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhusaid: çuna vipra mahädhikäré yevä haya / tabe täna doça-guëa
kichu nä janmaya (Caitanya-Bhägavata , Ädi-lélä  6.26).
There is no possibility of good or bad material qualities eventouching an uttama-bhägavata mahä-adhikäré  of bhakti .
Those who continue to view him as lowly will go to hell.Çré Kåñëa similarly instructed Uddhava:
na mayy ekänta-bhaktänäà / guëa-doñodbhavä guëäù
sädhünäà sama-cittänäà / buddheù param upeyuñäm
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.20.36
There is no possibility of the piety or sin resulting from the
performance of prescribed or forbidden activities coming to Myaikäntika-bhaktas who are free from attachment and envy, who
have equal vision towards everyone and who have attainedBhagavän, who is beyond mundane intelligence.
Yet one should always remember that the apparently poor
behaviour of such ananya-bhaktas is not to be imitated. One30! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 584
should neither criticise them nor associate with them. As it
is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.33.29): tejéyasäà na doñäya
vahneù sarva-bhujo yathä. Destruction is certain for those
who criticise the behaviour of mahä-bhägavatas  who exter-
nally may appear to behave improperly. Fire burns all sub-stances, pure or impure, although it remains pure itself. Simi-larly, although externally the behaviour of powerful mahä-
puruñas  may appear improper, they always remain pure.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  describes that the sons of Maréci, who
were the grandsons of jagad-guru Brahmä, had to take birth
among the asuras  as a result of ridiculing Brahmäs incon-
ceivable behaviour.
What to speak of perfected devotees, even if the sädhaka  of
ananya-bhakti  is seen to sometimes act improperly due to pre-
vious habits, he should still be considered saintly because hisaction is accidental. This is the deep meaning of this çloka . While
commenting on the above çloka  of Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.36), Çréla Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the same conclusion.
Çré Kåñëa is saying, A bhakta who performs ananya-
bhajana , who does not worship any other god or goddess, who
does not take shelter of any process other than My bhakti ,
such as karma , jïäna  and yoga, who does not desire anything
besides My pleasure and, what is more, who knows Me asthe only Master and as the Supreme, engages in My bhajana.
Such a bhakta naturally has no taste for improper behaviour.
But if accidentally, or by the will of fate, there is a discrep-ancy in his behaviour, he should still be considered saintly.This is My special order. If a person disobeys it, he will incursin. The reason such persons are to be considered sädhus is
explained herein. It is because their resolve is proper. In otherwords, they have aikäntika-niñöhä , exclusive faith, in Me.
In this regard, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has
commented on the following çloka  from Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.27-28):ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !585
jäta-çraddho mat-kathäsu / nirviëëaù sarva-karmasu

tato bhajeta mäà prétaù / çraddhälur dåòha-niçcayaù
juñamäëaç ca tän kämän / duùkhodarkäàç ca garhayan
He writes that the word dåòha-niçcayaù  in the phrase
çraddhälur dåòha-niçcayaù  means, Whether I am attached
to home, etc., or not, or whether that attachment increases,if millions of obstacles enter my bhajana , if due to offenses I
have to go to hell, or even if I am overpowered by lust, I willnot accept the processes of jïäna , karma and yoga under any
circumstance, even if Brahmä himself orders me. Those whohave such determination are called dåòha-niçcayaù .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Even
if those who engage in My bhajana with their minds com-
pletely fixed on Me, are badly behaved, still they should beconsidered saintly because the resolve they take in their en-gagement is righteous in every respect and all-beautiful. Themeaning of the word su-duräcäraù  must be understood prop-
erly. The behaviour of a baddha-jéva is of two types:
sämbandhika  (conditional) and svarüpa-gata  (constitutional).
Activities such as keeping clean, performing pious acts andnourishing or satisfying the needs of the body, society andprogress of mind are called sämbandhika (conditional) .
Bhajana which is a fully conscious activity performed for Me
by the jéva in his pure state is his svarüpa-gata  (constitutional
function). This function is also called amiçra-bhakti or
kevala-bhakti . In the bound state the jévas  performance of
kevala-bhakti  has an irrevocable relationship with his
sämbandhika  behaviour. Sämbandhika  behaviour will cer-
tainly continue as long as one has this body, even whenananya-bhakti  appears. Only when bhakti  appears does the
jéva lose his taste in everything that is unfavourable to devo-
tion. One becomes detached from sense objects to the extent30! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 586
that ones taste increases in kåñëa-bhajana . Until the taste
for sense objects is completely removed, it sometimes forcesone to behave improperly, but it is very quickly subdued byacquiring a loving tendency towards Kåñëa. The behaviourof a person who is situated in the higher levels of bhakti is
all-beautiful and right eous. If sometimes, accidentally, a per-
son is seen to be engaging not only in bad, but evil behaviour,performing activities for which a bhakta does not have a natural
taste such as killing others, taking away others wealth andhaving illicit relationships with others wives, he will be veryquickly purified of such behaviour nonetheless. My bhakti ,
which is very powerful and purifying, is not polluted by thisbehaviour. This should be understood. A parama-bhakta should
not be considered degraded because of his past indulgence inactivities such as eating fish or having illicit relationships withwomen.

The following questions may be raised: How can You ac-
cept the service of such an adharmika  and unrighteous per-
son? How can You eat the foodstuffs offered by a person
whose heart is polluted by defects such as lust and anger?Çré Bhagavän answers by speaking this çloka  beginning with
the word kñipram. He very quickly becomes righteous. Here
the word kñipram  means that, he quickly becomes righteous
and achieves eternal peace. The words bhavati  and nigacchati
are used in the present tense instead of the future. This provesthat right after engaging in irreligious or abominable activ-ity, he laments and remembers Kåñëa again and again, thushe quickly becomes righteous. Alas, alas! There is nobodyfallen like me who has brought such infamy to bhakti . Fie on
me! Repeatedly lamenting in this way, he attains eternalpeace. Or if he eventually becomes dharmika  and righteous,
irreligiosity and contamination may remain in him in a subtleform. The deadly heat of fever or poison may remain for sometime even after taking the best medicine. Similarly, as soonas bhakti  enters such a persons mind, his evil conduct ceases,
though it may remain in a subtle form for some time. Later,in a higher state, indications of poor behaviour such as lustand anger may exist but they will have no influence, just likea snake whose poisonous fangs have been removed and whosepoison is thus ineffective. This should be understood. Thus,his lust and anger are eternally quelled ( çäntim ) in a way that
is unparalleled. He should be considered to have a pure hearteven while he is still in the condition where he behaves in-appropriately.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé says that if they become religious or
righteous then there is no argument, but what can be said ofa bhakta who is unable to give up such bad behaviour even
until the time of death? In response to this, Bhagavän31! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 588
strongly and angrily says: kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù
praëaçyati. Even when he dies, he does not fall. But those
who speak harshly against him due to poor logic will notaccept this. Thinking like this, Kåñëa spoke words of encour-agement to Arjuna who was overwhelmed with grief anddoubt. O Kaunteya, while making a great sound with kettledrums, go to the assembly of those who dispute this, andraising both your arms in the air, and being free from anydoubt, declare that a bhakta  of Mine is never destroyed, even
if he is poorly behaved. Rather, he becomes successful. In thisway all their illogical words will be destroyed by your elo-quence and they will definitely take shelter of you, accept-ing you as their guru .
Here, the following objection may be raised: Why is
Bhagavän asking Arjuna to make this declaration instead ofmaking it Himself? As Bhagavän says in Bhagavad-gétä  (18.65):
You will surely attain Me. In truth, I am taking this vow
because you are very dear to Me. So why does Bhagavän not
say: O Kaunteya, I declare that My bhakta is never lost? In
response it is said that at that time Bhagavän pondered, Icannot tolerate even the slightest insult to My bhaktas  and
therefore, in many instances, I Myself sometimes break Myown vow, even though I have to accept insults as a result. Inthis way, I protect the words of My bhakta , just as I will pro-
tect the words of Bhéñma in this battle by breaking My ownvow. Those who are non-devotees and cynics will laugh atMy vow, but the words of Arjuna will be like marks etchedon stone. For this reason, Kåñëa made Arjuna take this vow.
Having heard about the ananya-bhakti of such an ill-be-
haved person, some will understand this to mean that anananya-bhakta is only one who has no adharmika qualities
such as lamentation, delusion and anger which all arise fromattachment to wife, children and so forth. But such an ex-planation by so-called scholars should be rejected.ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !589
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Sädhakas  of ananya-bhakti  have a natural distaste for
improper or evil behaviour and always will have. Yet, if by
accident the ananya-bhakta  is poorly behaved, due to the will
of providence that tendency is only temporary. The incon-ceivable influence of ananya-bhakti  is not lost by it. The
tendency to misbehave is quickly removed by the inconceiv-able influence of ananya-bhakti situated in the heart, and
such persons become free from piety and sin and attain su-preme peace born of bhakti . Ananya-bhaktas are never lost.
In the present çloka , Kåñëa, who is very affectionate to His
bhaktas , is making His dearmost friend Arjuna take this oath.
This statement is also in the Nåsiàha Puräëa :
bhagavati ca haräv ananya-cetä
bhåça-malino pi viräjate manuñyaù
na hi çaça-kala-cchaviù kadäcit
timira-paräbhavatäm upaiti candraù
Those bhaktas whose thoughts are exclusively absorbed in Çré
Hari are always situated in their own glory, even if externallythey are seen to engage in abominable behaviour. This is becauseof the influence of bhakti  situated within their hearts. This is
likened to the full moon that has dark spots on it, even thoughit is never covered by darkness.
 Çré Bhagavän has also said:
bädhyamäno pi mad-bhakto / viñayair ajitendriyaù
präyaù pragalbhayä bhaktyä / viñayair näbhibhüyate
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.14.18
My dear Uddhava, if My bhakta  has not fully conquered his
senses, he may be afflicted by material desires, but because of hisunflinching bhajana  to Me, he will not be defeated by sense grati-
fication.31! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 590
While commenting on this çloka , Çréla Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura writes: Even those who are just in thepreliminary stage of sädhana-bhakti  become successful and
blessed, not to mention those who are gradually attainingthe stages of niñöhä  and bhäva , what to speak of çuddha-
bhaktas in whose hearts bhäva  has already manifested.
In literature dealing with jïäna -märga  (the path of jïäna ),
both a jïäné  who behaves improperly, and his jïäna  are
criticised, but even if a bhakta behaves improperly he and his
bhakti  are not criticised in the bhakti-çästras . In this regard,
one of the best Nava-yogendras , Karabhäjana Åñi, says:
sva-päda-mülaà bhajataù priyasya
tyaktänya-bhävasya hariù pareçaù
vikarma yac cotpatitaà kathaïcid
dhunoti sarvaà hådi sanniviñöaù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.5.42
It is not possible for those premé-bhaktas who engage in bhajana
to the lotus feet of their most dear Çré Kåñëa with ananya-bhäva ,
having given up all other thoughts, faiths and activities, toengage in sinful activities. However, if somehow or other theydo, then by sitting in their heart, Çré Hari cleans everything andmakes their hearts pure.
Someone may say that a bhakta who engages in sinful ac-
tivity must atone for it, but Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.20.25)
states:
yadi kuryät pramädena / yogé karma vigarhitam
yogenaiva dahed aàho / nänyat tatra kadäcana
A bhakti -yogé never engages in an abominable act, but if at some
time, he commits an offense inadvertently then he should de-stroy this sin by the process of bhakti-yoga only; he should not
take to other difficult atonements such as cändräyaëa .ÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !591
This same conclusion is also given in Çré Bhakti-rasämåta-
sindhu :
niñiddhäcärato daivät / prayaçcittän tu nocitam
iti vaiñëava-çästräëäà / rahasyaà tad-vidäà matam
If by the will of fate a sädhaka  engages in a forbidden act, then it
is not proper for him to atone for it separately because the in-fluence of bhakti  performs the function of atonement. Separate
atonement is not necessary. This is the secret of the Vaiñëavaliterature.
Somebody may raise the following objection: Why did
Bhagavän Himself not make the statement, My bhaktas are
not lost. Why did He ask Arjuna to do it? The answer is
that bhakta-vatsala  Çré Kåñëa protects the words of His
bhaktas  even at the expense of breaking His own word. An
example of this took place in the battle of Kurukñetra, whereHe protected the vow of Bhéñma by breaking His own.

In this way, bhakti  to Me does not consider the incidental
discrepancies of a person who behaves improperly due to
karma.  What is the wonder in this? My bhakti  does not con-
sider the natural, inherent defects in those who are badlybehaved because of their caste. Antyaja , mlecchas , etc., are
called päpa-yonayaù  (those of sinful birth). As it is said in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.4.18), I pay my obeisances to that
omnipotent Bhagavän, who is so merciful that, by takingshelter of the lotus feet of a sad-guru  who is His representa-

Moreover, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.33.7) says: Any person
whose tongue has chanted Your name even once is mostworshipable, even though he may be born in a caëòäla  fam-
ily. Those who chant Your name have already performed alltypes of tapasyä and yajïa , bathed in all the holy places, stud-

This also refers to women, prostitutes, vaiçyas  and so on who
take shelter of Çré Bhagavän even if they are impure and nottruthful.

In the previous çloka , Bhagavän explained that a sädhaka
who devoutly engages in the practice of ananya-bhakti
should be considered saintly, even if externally some inci-dental poor behaviour is seen in him. Now, in the presentçloka , Bhagavän is explaining that those who take shelter
of Him by engaging in ananya-bhakti , even if born in sin-
ful caëòäla or mleccha families, in low-class çüdra  fami-
lies, or even women such as prostitutes who are naturallyÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !593
engaged in illicit activities, all very quickly attain the su-
preme destination by the influence of bhakti  to Çré Kåñëa,
which is rare even for yogés .
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.4.18), Çré Sukadeva Gosvämé says:
kiräta-hüëändhra-pulinda-pulkaça.. . Kiräta, Hüëa, Ändhra,
Pulinda, Pulkaça, Abhéra, Çumbha, Yavana, Khasa, etc., andall others addicted to sinful activities can be purified by tak-ing shelter of the bhaktas of Çré Hari, due to His being the
supreme power. I offer my obeisances to Him.
While commenting on this çloka , Çréla Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura writes: Just by becoming endowed witha scent of kevala-bhakti , even the most sinful attain perfec-
tion. Those who are low by caste or birth, such as the Kirätasand those who perform sinful actions, become purified bybhakti  only when they accept a çuddha-vaiñëava as their
guru . A person becomes supremely pure and free from the
defects coming from his birth as well as his actions, merely
by accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of a sad-guru . In
Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé says that bhakti
destroys both prärabdha  and aprärabdha  sins at their very
root. The Kirätas, for example, are impure because of theirbirth in a low caste. Sin in the form of a low caste birth isprärabdha-karma and is removed by just a scent of bhakti .
In this regard, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura furthersays: In practical life ignorant persons identify those whohave accepted vaiñëava-dékñä by their dynasty or caste. From
the spiritual perspective, none of the defects of caste and birthremain in a person who has taken dékñä . This is the reality.
Such persons themselves become fallen who place undueemphasis on the birth and caste of one who has taken dékñä
from a sad-guru.  Such condemnation, however, brings no
harm to the person who has taken initiation. A person whocriticises Vaiñëavas  is required to atone for it himself.
Devahüti also said:32! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 594

Simply by hearing and chanting Your name, paying obei-
sances to You and remembering You, even a caëòäla  imme-
diately becomes qualified to perform soma-yajïa , without
waiting for another birth to be able to do so. O Bhagavän!What, then, can be said about the incomparable influenceof Your darçana ?
Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Prabhupäda writes:
This çloka  is not spoken for common caëòälas  (dog-eat-
ers) who have taken birth in a fallen family according totheir prärabdha-karma , and remain engaged for the rest
of their lives in abominable acts fit for their caste. Rather,it is spoken for Vaiñëavas  who, after taking birth in a fam-
ily of dog eaters, become disinterested in the abominableactivities of their family tradition and, after taking dékñä
from a sad-guru , remain engaged in the service of Çré
Bhagavän.
It is certain that those who are gifted with a saintly na-
ture have followed with staunch faith all the behaviour
of a brähmiëical  tradition in their past life. In their pre-
vious birth, these people have completed austerities andsacrifices, bathed in the holy places, studied the Vedas and
so forth. They have just acted out taking birth in anäsurika family to bewilder the foolish and teach the ideal
among the Vedic paëòitas . Bhagavän has also said in
Itihäsa samuccaya :
na me bhaktaç caturvedé / mad-bhaktaù çva-pacaù priyaù
tasmai deyaà tato grähyaà / sa ca püjyo yathä hy ahamÇLOKA RÄJA-GUHYA -YOGA !595
It is not that a brähmaëa  who knows all the four Vedas will nec-
essarily be a bhakta , but My bhakta , even if born in a caëòäla  fam-
ily, is dear to Me and is the proper recipient of charity and theproper person from whom charity should be accepted. Even ifborn in a caëòäla  family, My bhakta , like Me, is respected by all,
even by the brähmaëas .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says that, in this way, the
reason a person who has taken shelter of the holy name ofÇré Kåñëa has taken birth in the house of a caëòäla  is to
perfect the quality of humility which is favourable forbhakti . From this çloka , we can also understand more about
the deliverance of the hunter by the mercy of Närada Muni,of Jagäé and Madhäé by the mercy of Çré Çré Gaura-Nityänanda, and of the prostitute by the mercy of ÖhäkuraHaridäsa.

If those who are born in a low family and who behave badly
can very quickly develop good conduct by taking shelter ofananya-bhakti , and can thus attain the supreme destination,
what is the wonder if those who are born in a good familyand whose conduct is pure also achieve the supreme destina-tion by taking exclusive shelter of Çré Bhagavän? MakingArjuna the object of His teachings, Çré Kåñëa is instructingall jévas to perform bhajana  to His eternal blissful svarüpa

In this çloka  it is declared that the material world is mu-
table, perishable and miserable, but it does not describe it asfalse. Some philosophers imagine that the world is false butthis idea is against the principle of Bhagavad-gétä . The dhäma
of Çré Kåñëa is called apräkåta or transcendental, and it is
eternal and blissful. Jévas who attain to that abode never fall

By the words man-manäù , Çré Bhagavän is concluding this
chapter by explaining the process of bhajana . Ätmänam , en-
gage your mind and body in Me and perform bhajana to Me.
The mere contact of bhakti  purifies everyone, whether they
are qualified or not. This is described in this Ninth Chapterwhich is entitled räja-guhyaù .
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä ,
by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura , on the Ninth Chapter
of Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä , which gives pleasure to the bhaktas
and is accepted by all saintly persons.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The supreme purpose for every jéva is to attain kåñëa-prema .
Performing ananya-bhakti  is the only means to achieve this
purpose. Only çuddha-jévas are qualified to perform bhajana
of Çré Bhagavän, the para-tattva . The svarüpa  of Çré Kåñëa
is the highest object of worship for çuddha-jévas. Unless one
understands this siddhänta perfectly, his endeavour for the
supreme goal ( paramärtha ) cannot be executed purely.
Çuddha-bhakti , completely free from jïäna , karma  and yoga,
has been explained in Chapters Seven and Eight. In the NinthChapter, the most supreme worshipable tattva has been de-
scribed. In order to establish this tattva , it is necessary to34! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  9 598
describe the defects coming from the worship of other devés
and devatäs  who also appear to be the worshipable reality.
Therefore, the eternally perfect nature of the supremely pureand conscious svarüpa  of Çré Kåñëa has been established sci-
entifically. The jïäné , yogé and the performers of yajïas
worship only manifestations, such as brahma  and
Paramätmä, of this very Bhagavän, who has an eternalsvarüpa.  A çuddha-bhakta , however,  does not worship these
partial manifestations of the Absolute; he only worships theeternal form of Çré Kåñëa. It is due to extreme ignorance thata person worships devas and devés  separately from the eter-
nal form of Kåñëa because by the worship of these devatäs
he can only partially attain his destination. One should com-pletely give up the worship of other devas  and devés  in the
bhakti -yoga process and, with no ulterior motive and with
staunch faith, one should maintain ones body while engag-ing in navadha-bhakti  such as çravaëam , kértanam  and
smaraëam  of Çré Kåñëa only. Such ananya-bhaktas are su-
perior to karmés , jïänés  and yogés , even if those ananya-
bhaktas  are badly behaved in the preliminary stage. Hence,
they are indeed saintly because in a matter of a few days they
become fixed in their aikäntika-bhäva  and their character
becomes pure in all respects.
Only çuddha-bhakti to Bhagavän will produce the above-
described fruit of prema . The çuddha-bhakta  of Bhagavän is
never destroyed, nor can he fall because Bhagavän person-ally maintains and protects him. Hence, those who are in-telligent maintain their body simply to perform çuddha-bhakti
to Çré Bhagavän.

The Seventh Chapter onwards explains bhakti-tattva  along
with Bhagaväns aiçvarya  feature . That same bhakti-tattva ,
also known as bhagavad-vibhüti , is being described in this
Tenth Chapter along with its confidential meaning.
It has been explained from the Seventh Chapter onwards
that Çré Bhagaväns aiçvarya  feature causes knowledge to arise
in the heart of the sädhaka that clearly reveals Him to be
the supreme worshipable object. Knowledge of this sameaiçvarya is now being given in detail for the pleasure of per-
sons blessed with devotion to Him. Kåñëa says in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.21.35): parokña-vädä åñayaù parokñaà ca
mama priyam. The statements of the åñis are indirect
(parokña ) and I also enjoy speaking in this way. According
to this statement, Kåñëas indirect manner of speaking makesthese topics a little difficult to understand. For this reason,He is speaking this çloka  beginning with the word bhüya
(again) which means that He is repeating räja-vidyä räja-
guhyaà idam , the most confidential knowledge, for Arjunas
better understanding. O Mahä-bäho! Just as you have mani-fested the superior strength of your arms, you are also ableto express  the superior power of your intelligence. For you
who are prepared to listen, the word çåëu (hear) is used to
ensure that you fully retain what is being said to you. Theword paramam  means that this knowledge is even superior

In the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Chapters, Bhagavän

that knowl edge which is most exalted and rare, and which
is not to be given to all, and then to explain it in an indirectway. Parokña-väda  is the nature of the Vedas . It is also Çré
Bhagaväns nature (to keep Himself hidden). Çré Caitanya-
caritämåta  (Ädi-lélä  3.88) states: tathäpi täìhära bhakta
jänaye täìhäre. That which is described in parokña-väda  is
difficult for an ordinary person to comprehend. Kåñëa triesto hide Himself in various ways but He reveals Himself toHis bhaktas . It is therefore necessary to carefully deliberate
upon vibhüti-yoga  as described in this chapter by taking shel-
ter of bhakti.

O Bhagavän, neither the devas , the asuras , nor anyone else

Kåñëas mercy cannot be attained by any means other than

can understand where, why, when and how You perform Yourlélä? Still, O Bhagavän, You manifest Yourself in the hearts of
Your bhaktas , who have received even a slight trace of the mercy
of Your lotus feet. Thus they become blessed and are the onlyones who can understand the tattva  of the glory of Your sac-cid-
änanda  svarüpa . Even after long-term enthusiastic endeavour,
in sädhanas  such as jïäna and vairägya  a person can never actu-
ally know Your glories.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, I am
the original cause of the devatäs  and the åñis. That is why,
on the strength of their own endeavours, they can never un-derstand My lélä-prabhava , the reality of My appearance in
the material world in a human-like form. Everyone, includ-ing the devas and maharñis , searches for My tattva  by the
strength of their intelligence. They can only partially real-ise Me despite diligently endeavouring with their material in-telligence. That part is  nirviçeña-brahma , the impersonal as-
pect of the mundane world. It is unmanifest, unvariegated
and devoid of qualities. They consider nirviçeña-brahma  to
be the parama-tattva , but it is not. I am parama-tattva  and
the embodiment of sac-cid-änanda , which is the speciality
of My eternal svarüpa.  I always manifest Myself through My
acintya-çakti  (inconceivable potency) . I am completely devoid
of any material contamination and possess all transcenden-tal qualities. My aparä çakti  (external potency) manifests a
partial aspect of My svarüpa  called Éçvara or Paramätmä, who
dwells within all jévas. Brahma  is one of My indistinct forms
and is without attributes, is impersonal and is the negative2! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  10 604
aspect of My personality, beyond the conception of the
baddha-jévas  who are deluded by My aparä çakti . Therefore,
only two of My manifestations, Éçvara (or Paramätmä) andbrahma , are indicated by these direct and indirect relation-
ships with the created world. Sometimes, by My acintya-çakti ,
I manifest My own svarüpa  in this material world. At that
time, the aforementioned devas  and maharñis , who cannot
understand the glory of My acintya-çakti  on the strength of
their own intelligence, think the appearance of My eternal,transcendental svarüpa  (the above-mentioned éçvara-tattva ) to
be mortal. This is because they are bewildered by mäyä . Think-
ing the dry brahma-bhäva  to be superior, they attempt to merge
into it. My bhaktas , however, understand that My acintya-çakti
is beyond the grasp of their limited human comprehension, andsimply engage in My bhajana . Upon seeing their attitude, I
become compassionate and bestow pure intelligence uponthem by which they can easily experience My svarüpa .

The following question may be raised. Do the devatäs and
maharñis  know the facts about the birth of Your body, which is
parabrahma , beyond the bounds of all time and space? Touch-
ing His chest with His forefinger, Çré Kåñëa responds by speak-ing this çloka  beginning with the words yo mäm . He who knows
Me to be unborn alone knows Me in truth. Does this meanthat only You are the beginningless truth and the great GrandsireBrahmä is not? If Brahmä is without beginning, then he mustknow You to be Paramätmä without birth or cause. In response,to this, Çré Bhagavän says, yo mäm vetti , etc. Only he who
knows Me to be without beginning or cause, unborn and bornfrom Vasudeva, is the actual knower of the truth  (tattva-jïa ).
Here, the word mäm  refers to Çré Bhagavän who is born from
Vasudeva. According to My statement (in Gétä 4.9), My birth
and activities are divine. Because I am Paramätmä, My takingbirth and remaining unborn are performed by My acintya-çakti
and are absolutely true. As it is said in Gétä (4.6), Though I
am unborn, I, who am eternal and unchanging, take birth.Uddhava has also said:
karmäëy anéhasya bhavo bhavasya te
durgäçrayo thäri-bhayät paläyanam
kälätmano yat pramadä-yutäçramaù

Çrémad-Bhägavatam  3.4.16
O Prabhu! Although You are desireless, You engage in action,
although unborn You take birth, and although You are deathpersonified, You run in fear of the enemy and hide in the Dvärakäfort. Although You are self-satisfied, You enjoy with sixteenthousand women. Seeing these wonderful activities, the intel-
ligence of even great scholars becomes bewildered.3! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  10 606
In this regard, there is a çloka  by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé the
author of Çré Laghu Bhägavatämåta : The bewilderment of the
scholars in this case is not factual because it is not due to ma-terial illusion. However, it would be better if it were absent. Inother words, even that which is unintelligable for scholars iscreated by My acintya-çakti. Hence, the acintya-çakti is the
cause of My variegated or contradictory nature which causestheir bewilderment. In My Dämodara-lélä, I appeared to belimited, My belly bound by a small thread of jingling bells, andsimultaneously I appeared to be unlimited, because My bellycould not be bound by the long ropes of Yaçodä-maiyä. Thisis beyond reasoning. In the same way, My taking birth and atthe same time not being born is also beyond reasoning.
By use of the word loka-maheçvaram which means the
Supreme Lord of the universe, Bhagavän explains Hisaiçvarya  which is very difficult to understand. O Arjuna,
among human beings, only those who know your chariot
driver  to be loka-maheçvara are asammüòhäù , freed from all
sins or obstacles to bhakti. Those who think that I am un-
born, without beginning and have the nature of a supremecontroller, etc., but who think that I only imitate birth, aresammüòhäù  (bewildered) and are not liberated from sin.

Here it is stated that Çré Bhagavän is ajaù, unborn. In the
Second Chapter the jévas are also described as ajaù, even though
they are vibhinnäàça , separated parts of Bhagavän (also  Gétä
15.7, mamaiväàço jéva-loke ). The jéva is aëucit , an atomic con-
scious entity, but Bhagavän is pürëacit , the complete conscious
entity. The jévas are under the control of Bhagaväns mäyä
whereas He is the master of mäyä . The gross body of the shack-
led jévas is mutable but Kåñëas body is sac-cid-änanda , im-
mutable and eternal. When He descends into the materialÇLOKA VIBHÜTI -YOGA !607
world, He comes in His own eternal svarüpa  through the me-
dium of His yogamäyä-çakti . He existed be fore the creation,
He is still existing now and He will continue to exist in thefuture. The following mantras  from the Vedas also establish
this conclusion: aham eväsam evägre , Only I was existing
before creation, when there was nothing but Myself ( Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  2.9.33);  bhagavän eka äsedam , Çré Bhagavän
existed prior to the creation as one without a second ( Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  3.5.23); anädir ädir govindaù , That original Per-
son is Lord Govinda, who is without beginning ( Brahma-
saàhitä 5.1); eko ha vai näräyaëa äsét , In the beginning only
Näräyaëa existed  (Mahä Upaniñad 1).
The present çloka  describes that although Bhagavän is un-
born, by the influence of His acintya-çakti  He is simulta-
neously the eternal son of Vasudeva-Devaké and Nanda-Yaçodä. His svarüpa  can only be understood by kevala-bhakti
and not by any other sädhana .
One should not consider Çré Kåñëa to be an ordinary person.
But if it is said that He is famous as the son of Devaké or Yaçodä,then how can He be without birth? The answer to this is givenin çästras  such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam , as follows: Çré Kåñëa did
not take birth like an ordinary baby. In the prison house ofKaàsa, He appeared before Vasudeva and Devaké in His svarüpa
as a young boy carrying çaìkha , cakra , gadä and padma  (conch,
disc, club and lotus flower), decorated with various types of or-naments and with beautiful hair on His head. Later, at the re-quest of Vasudeva and Devaké, He became a smallbaby.Although Çré Kåñëa did not openly exhibit His lélä of being
born in His two-handed form from the womb of Yaçodä-maiyäas Yaçodä-nandana in Gokula, still, while only an infant, Hekilled very fearsome and powerful asuras  such as Pütanä and
Çakaöäsura thus liberating them. He displayed the whole uni-verse within His child-like mouth and performed many other3! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  10 608

Çré Kåñëa is Svayaà Bhagavän, the Éçvara of all éçvaras , the
source of everyone and without cause.

independent qualification to penetrate and understand Mytattva  which is guëätéta , beyond the modes. Therefore,
Bhagavän says, There are three qualities which could in-directly cause one to acquire tattva-jïäna of Me: buddhi (the
ability to ascertain subtle meanings), jïänam (discrimina-
tion of conscious and unconscious objects) and asammohaù
(the absence of anxiety). But these qualities are not thedirect cause.  None of the various qualities that are seen in
people at different times are created independently.  There-
fore, Çré Bhagavän further states:  Kñamä (tolerance), satya
(truthfulness), dama (control of the external senses) and
çama (controlling the mind) are all sättvika. Sukha  is
sättvika , duùkha  is tämasika , bhavo bhävo (birth and death)
are a special type of misery and fear is tämasika.  Fearless-
ness arising from knowledge is sättvika  but, if it is born from

then it is räjasika . When a person is free from illusion, or
the feeling that he is the doer, his performance of tapa (aus-
terity) and däna  (charity) are sättvika.  If performed by one
who is under illusion, they are räjasika . Yaçaù  (fame) and
ayaçaù  (infamy) should be understood in the same manner.
They have all originated from My mäyä , but since çakti (the

Çré Kåñëa is the origin of both mundane and spiritual cre-

instructions and mercy of the tattva-vit Vaiñëavas. Only with
the help of such transcendental knowledge ( tattva-jïäna ), can
the thoughts of sädhus  become fixed in çuddha-bhakti to Çré

instruction that has come from modern concocted commen-taries which are devoid of bhakti , by hearing from bewildered
so-called gurus  who are bereft of tattva-jïäna , or by receiv-

O King, as the guru  of Malayadhvaja, Bhagavän Himself illumi-

Bhagavän says, No, No. I am explaining how I bless onlyMy ananya-bhaktas , not yogés  or others. I Myself am always
enthusiastic to give My mercy to them so they need notundergo any anxiety to achieve it. Entering the core of theirintelligence ( ätma-bhäva-sthaù ), I dispel the darkness of their
hearts with the lamp of knowledge ( jïäna-dépena ). That
jïäna  which enlightens one about Me is not sättvika ; it is
nirguëa . And because this jïäna  is born from bhakti , it is
special, even within the category of nirguëa-jïäna. Only with
the lamp of this particular jïäna  do I destroy the darkness
in their hearts. Therefore, why should they endeavour for this?For those who are exclusively devoted to Me, I carry theirmaintenance and their requirements. In accordance withthis statement of Gétä (9.22), Çré Bhagavän accepts the bur-
den of satisfying all of the material and spiritual needs ofhis ananya-bhaktas .
The above four çlokas  of Gétä  are famous as the essence of
Bhagavad-gétä. They are all-auspicious and dispel the jévas
misery, which is born of ignorance.

Although  jïänés  and yogés  try to attain knowledge by the
power of their own intelligence, they remain unsuccessful.Only the ananya-bhaktas  of Çré Kåñëa who take exclusive
shelter of Him can easily attain knowledge of Him by Hismercy. And since the bhaktas  cannot maintain their lives
without Kåñëa, they are the supreme object of His mercy. ÇréBaladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa quotes Kåñëa as saying: Being pleasedby their aikäntika bhäva , I bestow upon them complete mercy
and also inspire their intelligence, just as I care for their yoga
and kñema . The full responsibility for their maintenance is
solely Mine. They do not need to endeavour for anything.11! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  10 620
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, In
this way, ignorance cannot remain within those who engagein the process of bhakti-yoga.  Some think that only those
who try to search after tad-vastu  (the Absolute Reality) by
sequentially eliminating that which is atat (non-real), accord-
ing to the principle of negation ( neti-neti ), attain true knowl-
edge, and that those who simply cultivate the process of bhakti
are unable to attain such rare jïäna . O Arjuna, the basic idea
is that the insignificant jéva can never attain real tattva-
jïäna merely on the strength of his own intelligence. No
matter how much he deliberates, he can never achieve evena particle of pure jïäna . But if I bless him, then even an
insignificant jéva can easily acquire complete and thorough
transcendental knowledge by the influence of My acintya-
çakti . Simply by dwelling within the hearts of My ananya-
bhaktas , I easily enlighten them with the lamp of transcen-
dental knowledge. By special mercy, I become situated in their
hearts and completely destroy the darkness born of ignorance
which arises from mundane association. It is the right of thejéva to acquire that pure knowledge which appears only by
the process of bhakti-yoga , not by reasoning.
Just as the the essence of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  is contained
within four çlokas  (2.9.31-34) spoken directly by Bhagavän
Çré Kåñëa to Brahmä, in the same way, the above four çlokas
(10.8-11) are the essence of Bhagavad-gétä . Hence, they are
popularly known as catuù-çloké Gétä.  The essence of Gétä  as
described in these four çlokas  is bhakti.  Çré Kåñëa is person-
ally explaining the nature of ananya-bhakti  to Arjuna. When
the sädhaka  takes shelter of ananya-bhakti , Çré Kåñëa bestows
His mercy upon him so that he can easily cross the ocean ofmaterial existence and become eligible to enter His rasamayé
bhakti  (bhakti  characterised by five primary mellows) in the
land of Vraja.ÇLOKA VIBHÜTI -YOGA !621

Arjuna now speaks this çloka  beginning with the word
param  with a desire to hear in detail the meaning of what
was previously described in brief. Param  means the highest
and dhäma  means You are parama-brahma , having the beau-
tiful form of Çyämasundara.  According to the  Amara-koña
dictionary, gåha  (home), deha  (body), tviö (complexion),
prabhäva (glory) and dhäma  (abode) are all synonymous. You
are that very dhäma . Unlike the jévas, there is no difference
between You and Your body. What is the svarüpa  of that
dhäma ? In response Çré Bhagavän says:  pavitraà-paramam .
Whoever sees the svarüpa  of this form becomes free from
the impurity of ignorance. Therefore, the sages call Youçäsvataà puruñam ähuù  (the eternal person) and glorify the

The statement, I am the beginning, middle and end, estab-lishes that Çré Bhagavän is the original doer ( kärttä ) behind
all creation. Of Vedic knowledge, I am ätma-jïäna , knowl-
edge of the self. Within logical debate  (pravadatäm ), consist-

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In this çloka , Bhagavän has explained that, of the various
aspects of knowledge, His vibhüti is adhyätma-vidyä , spiritual
knowledge. Vidyä is the education which a person acquires
in relation to knowable subjects by the use of his own intel-ligence. Çästra describes eighteen types of vidyäs.  Among them,
fourteen are prominent:
aìgäni vedaç catväro mémäàsä nyäya-vistaraù
dharma-çästraà puräëaï ca vidyä hy etäà caturdaçaù
äyur-vedo dhanur-vedo gändharväç ceti te trayaù
artha-çästraà caturthaï ca vidyä hy añöädaçaiva täù
Viñëu PuräëaÇLOKA VIBHÜTI -YOGA !639
Çikñä , kalpa , vyäkaraëa , nirukta , jyotiña  and chanda are the six types
of knowledge known as vedäìga  (the limbs of the Vedas ). Åg,
Säma , Yajuh  and Atharva  are the four Vedas . All these combined
with mémäàsä , nyäya , dharma-çästra  and the Puräëas  comprise
the fourteen chief vidyäs .
Practice of these vidyäs  sharpens a persons intelligence and
increases his various fields of knowledge. This jïäna  not only
helps a person to maintain his livelihood, but it also guideshim on the path of dharma . However, adhyätma-vidyä (tran-
scendental knowledge) gives human beings immortality, lib-erating them from their bondage to the material world. Itgives them complete knowledge of parabrahma , which allows
them to realise the supreme eternal reality; Thus it is supe-rior to all the above-mentioned vidyäs . This adhyätma-vidyä
is Kåñëas vibhüti . Bhagavad-gétä  and the Upaniñads  are in-
cluded within the category of adhyätma-vidyä . The rasamayé
bhakti  (bhakti  which is filled with rasa) of the residents of
Vraja, as described in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-
Bhägavatam , is millions of times superior to the adhyätma-
vidyä  of Uddhava. Since this rasamayé bhakti is the essence
of the hlädiné and saàvit-çaktis of Çré Kåñëas svarüpa , it is
truly the svarüpa  of Kåñëa, whereas adhyätma-vidyä  is a par-
tial vibhüti  of prema-bhakti.  This is also confirmed in the
dialogue between Räya Rämänanda and Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu in Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya-lélä  8.245):
prabhu kahe ,kon vidyä vidyä-madhye sära?
räya kahe ,kåñëa-bhakti vinä vidyä nähi ära
Mahäprabhu inquired, Among all vidyäs , which is the best?
Räya Rämänanda replied, Besides kåñëa -bhakti there is no other
vidyä .
A similar statement is made in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(4.29.49): sä vidyä tan-matir yayä. That by which ones32! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  10 640
intelligence becomes fixed on the lotus feet of Çré Bhagavän
is the only real vidyä .
Moreover, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.14.3) states:
jïäne prayäsam udapäsya namanta eva
jévanti san-mukharitäà bhavadéya-värtäm
sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhir
ye präyaço jita jito py asi tais tri-lokyäm
Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has explained the confidential meaning
of the statement jïäne prayäsam udapäsya  in this çloka.  There
are three types of knowledge that are opposed to bhakti , which
concern the oneness of the jéva and brahma; nirviçeña , niräkära
and jéva-brahma-aikyaväda  jïäna. What is more, Svayaà
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa is replete with six opulences: jïäna-tvadéya-
svarüpa-aiçvarya-mahimä-vicäre.  From a portion of a portion
of His plenary portion, this material world is created, main-tained and annihilated. Even if one does not try to understandall these subject matters, or does not even make the effort totravel to the holy places, merely by listening with love to Kåñëasbeautiful pastimes, Çré Kåñëa, who cannot be conquered byanybody, becomes controlled.
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa has also said (in regard to those who
debate) that He is the väda, the conclusion ( tattva ) ascertained
by proper deliberation, logic and argument. In the field of ar-gument and logic, väda, jalpa  and vitaëòä  are quite well known.
When, for the sake of establishing ones own opinion, one con-tinuously finds faults with the opponents statements, it iscalled jalpa . Keeping the truth aside and avoiding proper de-
liberation and logic while finding fault in an opponents state-ment, is called vitaëòä . The purpose of such arguments is not
to ascertain reality but only to display ones scholarship, andthe desire to defeat the opponent is very strong. That delib-eration which ascertains the Absolute Reality is called väda .
This väda  is superior to all other forms of discussion.ÇLOKA VIBHÜTI -YOGA !641
When a self-realised guru and a disciple who is hankering
for transcendental knowledge have a positive dialogue aboutthe Absolute Truth, the conclusion they reach is called väda .
The pride of scholarship does not exist within such exchanges,as neither has the desire to defeat the other.

in the process of making one word, two or more other words
give up their case endings and are combined together, it iscalled samäsa , and the resulting word is called samäsa-pada ,
or the compound word. Primarily, there are six types ofsamäsa : 1) dvandva , 2) bahubrihi , 3) karma dhäraya , 4) tat-
puruña , 5) dvigu  and 6) avyayé bhäva . Among them dvandva
is the best because in other compounds either the first or thesecond part is prominent, or both words combined togethergive the meaning of another (third) object, but in thedvandva-samäsa  both words remain prominent, such as
Räma-Kåñëa or Rädhä-Kåñëa, therefore, Çré Kåñëa has saidthat the dvandva-samäsa  (dual compound) is His vibhüti .

säma . The Åg-mantra , which is sung as tväm åddhim
havämahe , indicates the Båhat-säma . Among metres He is the
metre called gäyatré.  Among seasons He is also kusuma-
äkaraù , the flower-bearing vasanta .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Bhagavän is non-different from His näma , guëa , lélä and
stutis (prayers). The Säma-veda  contains prayers which are
Bhagavän personified. It is, therefore, accepted as the bestof the Vedas  and is known as His vibhüti . Gäyatré  illuminates
the svarüpa  of Kåñëa and is, therefore, called the mother of
the Vedas. Bhagavän has thus counted gäyatré  amongst His
vibhütis . Among the twelve months He says that Märga-çérña
is His vibhüti . That month is neither too hot nor too cold,ÇLOKA VIBHÜTI -YOGA !645
and various Vedic activities are performed at that time. Just
before it begins, Kåñëas räsa-lélä  is performed, which is the
topmost of all His pastimes. In this month nature flourishesin full bloom and in the householders fields new crops areplanted . Agrähäyaëa  means the beginning of the year and,
therefore, Bhagavän says that it is His vibhüti . Of seasons
vasanta  (spring) is best. It is also known by the name åtu-
räja, the king of seasons. In this season, nature gives up her
old ornaments and becomes adorned with fresh decorativecoverings. Both inert and conscious beings are infused withnew life. In this season Kåñëas swing pastime and othervasanta pastimes are performed. This season is especially su-
preme because Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared at thistime, having accepted the bhäva  and känti (complexion) of
Çrématé Rädhikä, the personification of mahäbhäva . Thus
Bhagavän has counted it among His vibhütis .

In the Eleventh Chapter, Arjuna becomes fearful upon
seeing the viçvarüpa  (universal form) of Çré Bhagavän, and
with perplexed intelligence he begins praying to Him. There-after, Çré Hari gives bliss to Arjuna by again showing himHis eternal two-handed form.
At the end of the last chapter, Çré Kåñëa said, I pervade
and support the whole universe merely by one of My aàças
(portions). After hearing of the vibhütis  of his dear friend
who is the primeval person and the abode of all vibhütis ,
Arjuna became immersed in supreme bliss. He rejoiced uponhearing Çré Bhagaväns descriptions of His vibhütis . With a
desire to see that form, Arjuna now speaks three çlokas , the
first beginning with the words mad-anugrahäya.
Arjunas moha  (ignorance) of the aiçvarya  of Çré Kåñna was
dispelled upon hearing the statements of Çré Bhagavän, fromwhom all these vibhütis  originate.

In the previous chapter, when Arjuna heard Çré Bhagavän
speak the most confidential and supremely secret instructions
on ätma-tattva , his delusion was removed to a certain extent.
He understood clearly that Çré Kåñëa is Svayaà Bhagavän,the limit of para-tattva.  By His aàça  of Paramätmä, He en-
ters and pervades this entire universe, manifesting unlimitedopulences. Although He is the fountainhead of all  vibhütis ,
He remains distinct from them in His eternal, two-handedÇyämasundara svarüpa . Arjuna rejoices upon hearing
Bhagaväns statements and wants to realise this jïäna  (and
thus possess it as vijïäna ). He therefore says, Previously I
doubted whether or not Your vibhütis are independent from
You. But now this doubt, which was born from ignorance,has been dispelled. On a deeper level, this statement indi-cates that he now wants to see Kåñëas viçvarüpa .ÇLOKA VIÇVARÜPA  DARÇANA -YOGA !655 2-3

These middle six chapters explain that the root cause of
everything, including creation and annihilation, is ÇréBhagavän. As it is said in Gétä  (7.6), I alone am the cause of
the creation and destruction of the entire universe. ÇréBhagavän is unchangeable and eternal ( avyaya ). That is,
although He manifests the creation, He remains free fromany transformations and attachments. This is shown in çlokas
such as Gétä  (9.4): By Me this whole universe is pervaded,
and Gétä  (9.9): All these works cannot bind Me.

With a desire to see that form of Bhagavän which is full

antaryämé) . Therefore, You also know my inner desire and
You are capable of fulfilling it.
Someone may raise the following doubt: If Arjuna is an
eternal friend of Kåñëa, who is the mädhurya-maya-vigraha
(embodiment of sweetness), why is he desiring to see the
viçvarüpa  which expresses Bhagaväns aiçvarya ? The answer
is that, just as a person who is very fond of sweets also some-times desires to eat bitter and sour food (such as neem leavesor pickle), in the same way, Arjuna, who is always tasting ÇréÇLOKA VIÇVARÜPA  DARÇANA -YOGA !657
Kåñëas sweetness ( mädhurya ) also developed a desire to see
His viçvarüpa  which is an expression of His aiçvarya .
This has another meaning. Although Arjuna has no doubt
about the aiçvarya and super-excellence of Çré Kåñëa, he is
desiring to see this aiçvarya  form simply for his own personal
satisfaction.

That whole universe which you will not be able to see,

speaking this çloka  beginning with the words ihaika-sthaà

be, is existing in this body, which is the shelter of the uni-verse.

Çré Bhagavän is again saying, Within this universal form
of Mine, you will behold the entire world of moving and non-moving entities. This universal form cannot be seen by theperformance of hard labour for millions of years. It can onlybe seen by My mercy. In this viçvarüpa , you will see Me and
the entire world, as well as your victory or defeat in this battleof Kurukñetra. Moreover, you can also see whatever else youwant to see. Here, the word Guòäkeça is used. Guòäkä  means
sleep or ignorance, and éça means master. In this way,
Bhagavän indicates that Arjuna should behold this form withgreat attention. Thus his doubts about victory or defeat willbe dispelled, and Arjuna will be able to understand that inthis universe the performance of every activity is prearrangedby Kåñëa. Neither Arjuna nor anyone else is able to changethis arrangement in any way.

However, you are unable to see Me with the eyes you have
now. Therefore, I confer upon you divine eyes with whichto behold My 
yoga-aiçvarya .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän is saying, Arjuna, do not consider this form
to be illusory and composed of mäyä , but know it to be sac-
cid-änanda . My svarüpa , in which the whole universe exists,
is beyond the perception of the material senses. To makehim understand this, Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka
beginning with na tu.  He says, You will not be able to see
Me, the embodiment of concentrated cit, with your material
eyes. Therefore, I am granting you divyam (divine) eyes by
which you will see Me. The purpose of the above statementis just to astonish Arjuna who identifies himself as being anordinary mortal human being. But Arjuna is a chief associ-ate of Çré Bhagavän and only appears to be a human, so hiseyes are not actually material like those of an ordinary hu-man. Arjuna, who directly experiences the mädhurya  of Çré
Kåñëa, will not be able to see His aàça  (the universal form)
with those same eyes and, therefore, he has to accept divineeyes. What kind of logic is this? Some say that the supremelyfortunate eyes of an ananya-bhakta  see the great sweetness,
mahä-mädhurya , of Çré Kåñëas human-like pastimes and do
not see the aiçvarya  feature of His divine pastimes. This is
compared to the tongue which is used to tasting miçri  (rock
sugar) and does not appreciate the taste of guòa (gur,
unproccessed sugar). Therefore, on the request of Arjuna, andto give him the special, wondrous sight of the aiçvarya  fea-
ture of His divine form, Çré Bhagavän gives him divya-cakñu ,
superhuman eyes appropriate for savouring this particularloving exchange. Another purpose in giving him divya-cakñu
will become clear at the end of this chapter.ÇLOKA VIÇVARÜPA  DARÇANA -YOGA !663
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Arjuna is a nitya-siddha parikara , an eternally perfect as-
sociate of Çré Kåñëa. With eyes full of prema , he always sees
and relishes the ever-sweet form of Kåñëa. However, because
he has a desire to see the universal form, Bhagaväns givinghim divya-cakñu  is discussed herein. Transcendental eyes are
superior to gross material eyes. Yet, these divine eyes are quiteinsignificant and inferior to the unalloyed loving eyes ofArjuna. The viçvarüpa  of Çré Bhagavän cannot be seen with
gross material eyes; it can only be seen by divine vision at-tained by His mercy. Still, the mädhurya  of Çré Bhagavän is
neither visible to ordinary eyes nor to divine eyes.
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa clarifies this point in his
commentary. Çré Kåñëa gave Arjuna divine eyes which wereneeded to see His divine viçvarüpa , but He did not give him
a corresponding divine mind. If He had given him a divinemind, Arjuna would have developed interest in actually rel-ishing the viçvarüpa , but upon seeing it, Arjuna became dis-
interested. This is evident in Arjunas words after his aston-ishment upon seeing the universal form. He prayed that ÇréKåñëa only show him His natural, sac-cid-änanda , two-
handed form. This sentiment is also found in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (10.7.34-37):

One day, Kåñëa was on Yaçodä-maiyäs lap. She was breast-feed-
ing Him and kissing His captivating cheeks which were en-hanced by His mild smile. The child then yawned and showedYaçodä-maiyä His universal form within His mouth. The sud-den sight of this universal form in the mouth of her baby greatlyastonished her. Her body started to tremble and she closed hereyes. She thought, Alas! What is this I have seen? Fearful thatsomebody may have cast an evil-eye or spell on Kåñëa, she calledthe family priest and had him chant mantras  for Kåñëas pro-
tection. She felt relief only after she had given Kåñëa a purify-ing bath.
In his commentary on this çloka , Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé
explains a deep secret. How is it that Yaçodä-maiyä was ableto see the viçvarüpa of Kåñëa if she didnt have divya-cakñu ?
For the nourishment of Kåñëas pastimes ( lélä-puñöi ), the
maidservant of Lakñmi-devé (the pleasure potency), is mak-ing Yaçodäs love ever-new and ever-fresh by allowing herto taste vismaya-rasa (the nectar of astonishment) of Çré
Kåñëas  aiçvarya-çakti .
The purport of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkuras
commentary on this Bhägavatam  story is as follows. This
aiçvarya-çakti  could not slacken the vätsalya-jïäna of
Yaçodä-maiyä. This çakti of Çré Hari appeared in order to
test Prema devé, the goddess of love, but upon seeing Premadevés immeasurable power,  she accepted the position as
Prema devés servant. Here Yaçodä-maiyäs vätsalya-prema
is Prema devé. 
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.8.32-39) describes the following
pastime:

One day, Çré Kåñëa was playing at Brahmäëòa-ghaöa with
Çrédäma, Subala, Balaräma and some other cowherd boys. ChildKåñëa secretly ate some mud, but somehow the cowherd boyssaw Him doing this and complained to Yaçodä-maiyä. Yaçodä-maiyä came running, and, catching hold of Kåñëas hand, shebegan to chastise Him. Trembling with fear, Kåñëa said, Mother,I have not eaten any mud. All these boys are liars. If you dontbelieve Me, then you can look in My mouth and see for your-self. Saying this, Kåñëa opened His mouth and showed her the
whole universe containing all moving and non-moving entities,
the sky, etc., as well as His own dhäma .
Although the aiçvarya  feature is not acknowledged in
mädhurya-lélä , it manifests itself at the appropriate time.
That is, although Çré Kåñëas aiçvarya remains unmanifest
in His mädhurya-lélä , mädhurya-lélä  is not devoid of it. Çré
Kåñëa is the fountainhead of all aiçvarya  and mädhurya . In
some specific pastimes when both are needed, the aiçvarya
manifests itself. Being inspired by the potency called satya-
saìkalpa  (when ones words are always truthful), the aiçvarya
çakti manifested and drowned Yaçodä-maiyä in vismaya-rasa
by showing her Kåñëas viçvarüpa.  This made her forget her
anger towards Him. In this way, the aiçvarya-çakti  rendered
service to Prema devé. Çré Kåñëa is sporting as a human boyand therefore, for the nourishment of His lélä and to increase
the prema  of His bhaktas , He sometimes manifests His
aiçvarya.
Çré Caitanya-caritämåta  describes how Advaita Äcärya
requested Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu to show Him thatviçvarüpa  which is described in Bhagavad-gétä.  On His request,8! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  11 666
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu showed Him all the incidents that
took place in the battle of Mahäbhärata along with Hisviçvarüpa . Seeing the viçvarüpa , Advaita Äcärya closed His
eyes. Then Caitanya Mahäprabhu, making that formunmanifest, showed His natural form thereby restoringAdvaita Äcärya to His normal state.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, You
are My bhakta . With the eyes of unalloyed prema , you can
see My Kåñëa svarüpa . My aiçvarya  is related to the phenom-
enal world, so it has no purpose for those with eyes of unal-loyed prema and it cannot be seen by them. Gross material
eyes also cannot behold My aiçvarya  form. But those eyes
which are not filled with pure love, having some relation-ship with this world, but at the same time are not material,are called divya-cakñu . I am bestowing upon you divya-cakñu
by which you will be able to see My aiçvarya  form. Those
who are endowed with divine eyes and the ability to reason
naturally become attached to My aiçvarya  svarüpa  which has
a connection with this cosmic world, unlike My transcen-dental Kåñëa svarüpa . This is because their eyes of unalloyed
prema remain closed.

Dhåtaräñöra in six çlokas , while saying that Çré Kåñëa is not
only great, but that He is the greatest mystic, Yogeçvara. Inorder to show His universal form to Arjuna, He has givenhim divine eyes, which means that Arjuna is very dear toHim. The purport here is that victory for Arjuna in this battleappears to be a simple matter of course. Now there is no doubtthat by the mercy of Bhagavän, both material and spiritualauspiciousness will come to Arjuna. By this, Saïjaya alsoindicates to Dhåtaräñöra that his desire for his sons victoryhas been completely thwarted.

The universal form which Mahä-Yogeçvara Kåñëa showed
to Arjuna was most astonishing, supremely resplendent,wonderful to behold and decorated with various types ofcelestial ornaments. It was unlimited and all-pervading. Inthe body of the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa, Arjuna saw the entireuniverse situated in one place and divided into various forms.To remove Dhåtaräñöras doubt that Arjuna may have runaway in fear after seeing that terrifying form, Saïjaya said,Arjuna is a great bhakta  who knows kåñëa-tattva  and is
endowed with sattva-guëa.  He did not become fearful upon
seeing that thousand-headed form of Kåñëa, but instead ex-perienced adbhuta-rasa  (astonishment). Arjuna was endowed
with natural fortitude, but because he was absorbed inadbhuta-bhäva , he became ecstastic; his hairs stood on end
and his body trembled. Paying obeisances by bowing his headand folding his hands, he began to speak.ÇLOKA VIÇVARÜPA  DARÇANA -YOGA !671
Arjunas eyes were not closed out of fear, but due to his
experiencing abdhuta-rasa . The viçvarüpa of Çré Kåñëa is the
viñaya-älambana  (object) of this rasa, and Arjuna is the
äçraya-älambana  (receptacle). To see that form again and
again is an uddépana  (stimulus for remembrance). Paying
obeisances and folding his hands are anubhävas , and his hairs
standing on end, etc., are sättvika-bhävas.  Agitation of mind,
fortitude, exhilaration and so forth are saïcäré-bhävas . Here
the sthäyé-bhäva  is vismaya  (wonder). All the above-mentioned
ingredients combined with Arjunas sthäyé-bhäva  to manifest
vismaya-rasa . Regarding adbhuta-rasa , Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé
writes in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (4.2.1):
ätmocitair vibhävädyaiù / svädyatvaà bhakta-cetasi
sä vismaya-ratir nétäd- / bhuto-bhakti-raso bhavet
When vismaya-rati  becomes relishable within the heart of a bhakta  by
mixing with the appropriate elements of vibhäva and so forth, which
are proper and favourable to ones own bhäva , it is called adbhuta-rasa .

Upon seeing the inconceivable aiçvarya  form of Bhagavän,
Arjuna concluded that He is indeed the supreme object of knowl-edge, akñara-tattva (the imperishable reality), and can be known
only by transcendental knowledge. He is the resting place ofeveryone, immutable, and the imperishable person. He is alsothe source of eternal dharma , and He is its protector.

Now in this çloka  beginning with the word dyäv  and for
the next nine çlokas, Çré Bhagavän is showing His käla-rüpa,

After seeing that käla-rüpa  of Çré Bhagavän, Arjuna says,
O Sarväçraya, resting place of everyone, You are pervading
the whole earth, the firmament, the sky and all directions
with Your viçvarüpa . By You alone, the three worlds are per-
vaded. Upon seeing this most wonderful divine form of Yours,the people of the three worlds are disturbed and agitated infear.
This great battle of Kurukñetra was also seen by devas  such
as Brahmä, many asuras , the Pitås (forefathers), Gandharvas,
Yakñas, Räkñasas, Kinnaras and human beings. All saw thebattle according to their respective temperaments such asfriendship, enmity and indifference, but only those who werebhaktas  could see the universal form, by Kåñëas mercy, due
to being given divya-cakñu .
It was not that only Arjuna saw the viçvarüpa  with its
chariots, horses and so on like a person who sees his owndream, but even personalities like Vyäsa, Saïjaya, GrandsireBhéñma and Brahmä witnessed this aiçvarya  form of Çré
Bhagavän. This is the meaning of this çloka .

After hearing this dialogue between Kåñëa and Arjuna
from the mouth of Saïjaya, Dhåtaräñöra Mahäräja un-
doubtedly understood that the great unconquerable fight-
ers headed by Bhéñma and Droëa would also be killed andthat there was no possibility of Duryodhanas victory.The idea that they should try for a truce in such a situ-ation came to his mind, but he didnt express this exter-nally.
The wise Saïjaya could understand his mind and immedi-
ately began to describe what happened next. On the side ofthe Päëòavas, Arjuna trembled upon hearing the words ofKåñëa. Paying obeisances again and again, with a disturbedmind and a faltering voice, he offered his supplication at thelotus feet of Çré Bhagavän.

Arjuna said: O Håñékeça! Everyone in the universe
is becoming joyful and attached to You on hearingthe glori-fication of Your name, form and qualities.The 
räkñasas  are scattering out of fear, while the
hosts of siddhas  are offering their obeisances unto
You. All this is, indeed, most appropriate.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Arjuna knows the following tattva : The çré vigraha of
Bhagavän is pleased with those who are devoted to Him,whereas He displays His dreadful feature to those who areaverse to Him. Arjuna explains this while offering prayers toÇré Bhagavän. The word sthäne  is indeclinable and it means
yukta  or appropriate. It is used in all components of this çloka .
Arjuna has addressed Kåñëa as Håñékeça, meaning one whoturns the senses of His bhaktas  towards Himself, and the
senses of His non-devotees away. This entire world is beingattracted to You by the saìkértana  of Your glories. This is
appropriate because this world is devoted to You. Räkñasas ,
asuras , dänavas , piçäcas , etc., are running in all directions out
of fear. This is also appropriate because they are averse toYou. Hosts of beings, who have become perfect by practisingbhakti  to You, are paying obeisances to You. This is also ap-
propriate because they are Your bhaktas . This çloka  is fa-
mous in mantra-çästra  as the räkñoghëa-mantra (a mantra
to destroy räkñasas ).
S

The transcendental influence of Çré Bhagaväns form is such
that bhaktas  become joyful upon seeing it. But to those who
are äsurika  by nature and who are not devoted to Him, this
form appears like Yamaräja, the lord of death. In the wres-tling arena of Mathurä, worshipable elders like NandaÇLOKA VIÇVARÜPA  DARÇANA -YOGA !691
Mahäräja, friends and the Yädavas were very pleased to see
the beautiful nava-kiçora , Çré Kåñëa, but He appeared as death
personified to Kaàsa, as hard as a thunderbolt to the wres-tlers, as the enforcer of chastisement to the wicked kings, andas para-tattva  (Paramätmä) to the yogés . Therefore, upon
hearing the glories of Kåñëa, devoted jévas feel joy and be-
come attached to Him. The siddhas  become surrendered to
Him, while the asuras  and räkñasas  who are averse to Him
run in fear. These reactions are appropriate for each of them.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Arjuna said, Why will they not offer obeisances and bow
down to You? Certainly they will. Here, the word sat means
effect, and asat means the cause, thus, That person who is
superior to and beyond both sat and asat is You, the imper-
ishable ( akñara ) brahma .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the previous çloka , Arjuna explained that Çré Bhagavän
is worshipable for Brahmä, etc. In this çloka , he establishes
that Çré Bhagavän is the soul of everyone.  Devas , åñis,
Gandharvas and other beings like them will indeed pay obei-sances to You. They cannot exist without doing so becauseYou are one without a second, inconceivable, and endowedwith wonderful potencies. You are the Supreme Person, su-perior to everyone. You are the original creator of LordBrahmä, who is the creator of the universe. Therefore, You
are even superior to Brahmä.
Arjuna also said, Only Çré Bhagavän is worshipable for all,
but not only that but since He is the soul of everyone, He iseverything. He is superior to and distinct from the imperish-able brahma-tattva , jéva-tattva  and prakåti-tattva . Although He
is different from all these tattvas , they manifest from His
acintya-çakti.  Therefore, He also exists as everything. Not ev-
erything is Çré Bhagavän, nor is anything equal to Him. Ev-erything is the effect or result of His çakti . From this point of
view, He alone is everything, because no other object or real-ity exists independent of Him. Thus, He is called the unparal-leled parama-tattva.  The çrutis  state,  sarvaà khalv idaà
brahma.  Indeed, everything is brahma (Chändogya Upaniñad
3.14.1). They also state, neha nänästi kiïcana  (Båhad-äraëyaka
Upaniñad  4.4.19) and ( Kaöha Upaniñad  2.1.11). Here it is said
that everything such as the jéva and the inert world is brahma .
There is nothing except brahma .ÇLOKA VIÇVARÜPA  DARÇANA -YOGA !693
In contrast to this, çruti states:
nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm
eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän
   Kaöha Upaniñad  2.2.13,
Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad   6.13
Parabrahma  is the prime eternal among all eternal beings and
the prime conscious entity among all conscious beings.
 According to this çloka , the jévas are eternal, conscious and
unlimited in number but parabrahma  is the one and only su-
preme eternal and the supreme conscious being. Subsequently,the only verdict of the Vedas  is the principle of acintya-
bhedäbheda , the purest of all tattvas .

Çré Kåñëa is the original God. He is the supreme refuge of
everyone and He is all-pervading. Because His dhäma  is a
manifestation of His parä-çakti (transcendental energy), He
is non-different from His abode according to the principleof çakti-çaktimän abhede . This is established in Çvetäçvatara

We know our worshipable God, who is the master of the worlds,
to be the supreme amongst all controllers, the supreme God ofgods, and the supreme protector of those who can award protec-tion. He is transcendental to impersonal brahma .
And furthermore, Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (6.8) states:

paid obeisances again and again and said, In this world, thefather does not accept the faults of his son as serious, a friendthe faults of a friend, nor a lover the faults of the beloved.You are Çré Bhagavän, yet You feel pleasure in dealing withbhaktas in sakhya , vätsalya  and mädhurya-rasa.  Out of mercy,
You reciprocate with all of them accordingly. Although myearlier behaviour with You was not improper from the per-spective of our eternal relationship in sakhya-bhäva , when I
consider Your glories and tattva , it seems that it was improper.
Previously, I had not seen this universal form of Yours.
Now my curiosity is satisfied. Although by seeing it I feelhappy, my mind is disturbed due to its terrible features. There-fore, please again show me Your form as Vasudeva-nandana,the zenith of sweetness, which is millions of times more dearto me than my own life. Although the naräkära-rüpa  (hu-

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The svarüpa  of Kåñëa is that of a young boy ( nava-kiçora ),
a beautiful actor ( naöa-vara ), dressed as a cowherd boy  (gopa-
veça) with a flute in his hand  (veëu-kara). This is Kåñëas
eternal form. Although He is the embodiment of mädhurya ,
aiçvarya  is also fully present in Him. Whether  aiçvarya  is
manifest or not, if the activities appropriate for nara-lélä  are
not transgressed, it is certainly called mädhurya . For example,
the killing of Pütanä occured when Kåñëa was a baby. How-ever, His behaviour as a baby was not exceeded by this mani-festation of His aiçvarya . Neglecting the activities of nara-
lélä to manifest aiçvarya-bhäva  is called aiçvarya . For example,
at the time of His birth, Çré Kåñëa appeared before Vasudevaand Devaké bedecked with various ornaments and dresses,thus exceeding the activities of a human child. This is calledaiçvarya-mayé-lélä.
Here Arjunas seeing the universal form is aiçvarya-mayé-lélä .
Afterwards he prayed to see the four-handed form, which wassomewhat familiar to him, as this was appropriate for theactivities of nara-lélä . While performing His pastimes with the
Yädavas and Päëòavas in His two-handed form, Çré Kåñëawould sometimes manifest His four-handed form. The pastimesin Dvärakä are somewhat aiçvarya-mayé , but all pastimes in
Vraja are mädhurya-mayé , or naravat  (human-like).
When Arjuna tied Açvatthämä, the killer of Draupadés
five sons, with ropes and brought him to her feet, DraupadéÇLOKA VIÇVARÜPA  DARÇANA -YOGA !705
was able to forgive Açvatthämä, but Bhéma could not and
wanted to kill him. To fulfil the desires of both and also totest the sharpness of Arjunas intelligence, Çré Kåñëa mani-fested His four-handed form. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.7.52)
states:
niçamya bhéma-gaditaà / draupadyäç ca catur-bhujaù
älokya vadanaà sakhyur / idam äha hasann iva
Caturbhuja, after hearing the words of Bhéma, Draupadé and
others, saw the face of His dear friend Arjuna, and began to speakas if smiling.
Once, while Kåñëa was joking with Rukmiëé, she could not
understand the meaning of His words and fell to the ground
unconscious. At that time, Kåñëa manifested His caturbhuja-
rüpa  and lifted her up with two of His arms. With His other
two arms He began to arrange her dishevelled hair and cleanher face. As it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.60.26):
paryaìkäd avaruhyäçu / täm utthäpya catur-bhujaù
keçän samuhya tad-vaktraà / prämåjat padma-päëinä
Arising swiftly from the couch, the four-armed Lord smoothed
her hair and gently touched her face with His lotus hand.
Once, in His Vraja lélä, Kåñëa suddenly disappeared from
the räsa-lélä . Manifesting His caturbhuja-rüpa  He stood on
the path of the gopés who were searching for Him. When the
gopés  saw Him, they paid their obeisances and moved on in
search of dvibhuja  (two-handed) Çyämasundara. In the mean-
time, Çrématé Rädhikä, the embodiment of mahäbhäva , came
to that place. Seeing Her, Kåñëa became overwhelmed anddespite great endeavour He was unable to maintain His four-armed form. This caturbhuja-rüpa  disappeared into His
dvibhuja-rüpa .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Arjuna as saying, Now46! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  11 706

of sahasra-bähu  (one thousand arms). O Kåñëa, I have un-
derstood without a doubt that this two-armed Çyämasundaraform is the embodiment of sac-cid-änanda  para-tattva , is
eternal and is the attractor of all jévas. The caturbhuja-mürti
of Näräyaëa eternally exists as the aiçvarya-viläsa of this
two-armed Çyamasundara rüpa . At the time of creation, this
gigantic viçvarüpa-mürti manifests from that four-armed
Näräyaëa form. My curiosity has been satisfied by this su-preme knowledge.

potency of My acintya-çakti  because I was pleased with you.
In Çré Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëas commentary, he has comparedthis prakäça  (manifestation) of Kåñëa with a valuable gem and
an expert theatre actor. Although a valuable gem is only oneobject, by displaying its various colours it satisfies many view-ers. Similarly, an expert actor entertains his audience by ap-pearing in various roles. In the same way, although Kåñëa isone, He manifested the viçvarüpa  which is present within Him.
This is the hidden meaning of Kåñëas statement.
Kåñëa again said, Because of you, even the devatäs  and
many bhaktas  saw this form. No one had ever seen it before.
When I went to the assembly of Duryodhana as a messen-ger of the Päëòavas, and in various ways tried to persuadethe Kauravas to give half the kingdom to the Päëòavas, thewicked Duryodhana tried to capture Me. I then manifesteda partial aspect  of My viçvarüpa before Dhåtaräñöra, the kings

Tenth Canto, the  Garbha-stotra states that it is even diffi-
cult for the devas to see this form. You are My nitya-bhakta

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, the form which you now see is most rare, su-

to see this nitya-rüpa . If you wonder how this human form is
so rare when it is seen by everyone, then I want to explain
this tattva  to you. Hear attentively. There are three types of
perceptions related to My sac-cid-änanda  kåñëa-rüpa : avidvat-
pratéti , yauktika-pratéti  and vidvat-pratéti . Avidvat-pratéti  is the
perception of the ignorant which is only based on empiric
knowledge. They see My nitya-svarüpa  as mundane and
temporary. One cannot understand the supreme nature of this
svarüpa  by such perception. By yauktika  (reasoning) or divya-
pratéti , the devas  and persons who are proud of their jïäna
consider My svarüpa  to be mundane and temporary. They
accept the eternal reality of either My universal form, which
pervades the whole universe, or My negative aspect of the
universe,  nirviçeña -brahma.  They conclude that My human
form is only a temporary means of worship. However, by52! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  11 716
vidvat-pratéti  (perception which is based on transcendental
knowledge), My bhaktas , who are endowed with conscious
vision  (cit-cakñu ), realise My human form to be directly the
abode of sac-cid-änanda . This type of realised vision is rare
even for the devas , among whom only Brahmä and Çiva, who
are My çuddha-bhaktas , are always longing to see My human
form. Having seen this viçvarüpa , you have been able to
understand, by My mercy, the supremacy of My eternal form.
This is because you are engaged in My pure bhakti in

One cannot obtain darçana of Çré Kåñëa in His most pleas-

performance of sacrifice, teaching Vedic mantras , study of çästra ,
or taking the renounced order of life, one cannot achieve Me.
And furthermore it is said:

Then by which means are You attainable? Expecting this
question from Arjuna, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  begin-
ning with the word bhaktyä . Even if one has the desire to
attain nirväëa-mokña  (impersonal liberation), he can only
enter into the brahma-svarüpa  with the help of bhakti . There
is no other way. After jïäna-sannyäsa , the guëi-bhütä bhakti
of the jïänés  finally develops to a slight degree. Nothing else
happens. By this they attain säyujya-mukti .
Later they attain Me, having known My svarüpa  in truth.
This I will explain and establish later in Gétä  18.55.

snakes such as Käliya, the twin arjuna trees and other non-mov-
ing entities with their consciousness covered, such as, bushesand schrubs all attained the perfection of life, and came to Mesimply because of their one-pointed devotion for Me.

Now in this çloka  beginning with the words mat-karma-

The import of the Eleventh Chapter is that Arjuna has
become firmly convinced about the mahä-aiçvarya  of Çré Kåñëa
and that he will be victorious in battle.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä ,

In this çloka  Çré Kåñëa is explaining the limbs of bhakti
that are to be followed by bhaktas  who take shelter of ananya-

My name, form and so forth. Those who are saìga-varjita ,
free from the attachment to the results of their actions andfree from poor association, and those who are nirvaira , free
from enmity to all living beings, see that their miseries arethe result of their own previous karma and have no feeling
of enmity towards those who are inimical towards them.Rather, they feel compassion for them. Only such personsattain to My kåñëa-svarüpa , not others.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura writes in his Vidvat-raïjana

tablished as the supreme refuge and the ultimate worshipablereality, compared to His viçvarüpa  käla-rüpa  and even the

attractive human form of Çré Kåñëa), bhaktas  have no
attraction for the sambandha-vigraha  (the relative mani-
festation of Bhagavän). This chapter concludes that the form
of Çré Kåñëa alone is the ocean of all nectarean mellows

sweetness  (parama-mädhurya-bhäva ).

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In this Twelfth Chapter, Çré Bhagavän confirms the su-
periority of all types of bhaktas over the jïänés.  And
among the bhaktas , only those who possess qualities such
as non-enviousness are glorified.
When the subject of bhakti was introduced,  Arjuna heard
that those who are endowed with çraddhä , who engage in
bhajana  to Çré Bhagavän with their hearts devoted to Him,
are yuktatama , the best among all types of yogés . This is
the opinion of Çré Bhagavän ( Gétä  6.47). Arjuna heard
about the supremacy of the bhaktas in introductory state-
ments such as these, and as this section concludes, he in-quires further, being desirous to hear more about that su-premacy. You explained that the word satata-yuktäù  means
those who are devoted to performing work for You. Thosewho are endowed with the symptoms You previously de-scribed engage in the service of Your Çyämasundara form.Others worship nirviçeña  (featureless), akñara  (imperish-
able) brahma , which is described in the Båhad-äraëyaka
çruti:  O Gärgé, the brähmaëas  know this akñara-brahma
as asthüla  (that which is not gross), asükñma  (that which

forth. Of these two types of persons who know yoga , who
is superior? In other words, who is acquainted with thebetter means to know and achieve You? Here, in the origi-nal çloka , the word yoga-vittamäù has been used. The word
yoga-vittara is generally used to compare two types of
worshippers, whereas the word yoga-vittamäù indicates the
superlative degree, and is used to decide who is the bestamong all types of people who perform worship. By usingthis word, Arjuna not only compares the two, but wantsto know who is the best.ÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !725 1

Of the various types of sädhana practised to quickly at-
tain Bhagavän, çuddha-bhakti  is the simplest, easiest and most
natural to perform. Its influence is unfailing. In this chap-
ter, viçuddha-bhakti is exclusively established as superior.
Arjuna has been hearing Bhagavän Çré Kåñëas instructions
with great attention. In the Sixth Chapter, in the çloka :
yogénäm api sarveñäm  (Gétä  6.47), Çré Kåñëa said that of all
yogés  (such as the karma-yogé , the dhyäna-yogé  and the tapa-
yogé) the bhakti-yogé  is superior. In the Seventh Chapter, in
the çloka , mayy äsakta-manäù  (Gétä  7.1), He said that to take
shelter of bhakti-yoga  is best. In the Eighth Chapter, in the
çloka,  prayäëa-käle manasäcalena  (Gétä  8.10), He described
the glory of yoga-bala , the power of yoga.  In the Ninth Chap-
ter, in the çloka,  jïäna-yajïena cäpy anye  (Gétä  9.15), He
talked about jïäna-yoga  and at the end of the Eleventh
Chapter, in the çloka,  mat-karma-kån mat-paramo  (Gétä
11.55), He again described the excellence of bhakti-yoga . Af-
ter hearing about these various types of yoga , Arjuna was
unable to ascertain whether it is better to worship thesaviçeña-svarüpa  (the personal form) of Yaçodä-nandana
Çyämasundara Çré Kåñëa, or brahma,  which is niùçaktika
(devoid of energy), niräkära  (formless), avyakta-svarüpa  (un-
manifest) and nirviçeña (featureless). Of these two types of
yogés , who has the superior knowledge of yoga? By saying yoga-
vittamäù , Arjuna is inquiring about who is the best of all yogés .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Arjuna as saying, O
Kåñëa! From all the instructions You have given so far, I haveunderstood that there are two types of yogés . One type wor-
ships You by performing all bodily and social activities un-der the control of Your supreme ananya-bhakti . The other

Çré Bhagavän said: Those yogés,  who with transcendental
faith fix their mind on My Çyämasundara form, and con-stantly worship Me with 
ananya-bhakti  are the best among
those who know yoga. This is My opinion.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän responds to Arjunas question in the previ-
ous çloka  by saying, My bhaktas are the best who, with
nirguëa-çraddhä (faith which is free from the influence of
the modes), fix their minds on My Çyämasundara form, be-ing ever-desirous of union with Me. As it is s aid in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.25.27), Çraddhä  which has the ätmä (self)
as its focus is in sattva-guëa ; çraddhä  which has karma (ac-
tion) as its focus is in rajo-guëa , and çraddhä which hasÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !727
irreligious activities as its focus is in tamo-guëa . But that
çraddhä  whose object and focus is service to Me is nirguëa.
In the present çloka  it is said, My ananya-bhaktas  are
yuktatamäù, or yoga-vittamäù , the best of yogés . From this
it can be concluded that, compared to ananya-bhaktas , oth-
ers, such as those whose bhakti is mixed with jïäna  or
karma , are yoga-vittara , but not yoga-vittamäù  (the best
knowers of yoga ). Thus, bhakti is superior to jïäna  and,
within bhakti , ananya-bhakti is supreme. This has been
established here.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
After hearing Arjunas question, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa was
very much pleased and said, I consider only those bhaktas
who constantly worship Me with nirguëa-çraddhä  and un-
alloyed devotion, fixing their minds on My Çyämasundaraform, to be the best of yogés . Such unalloyed devotees are in
reality the topmost yogés . A yogé whose bhakti  is mixed with
jïäna  and karma  is a little inferior. Bhakti-yoga  is therefore
superior to jïäna-yoga  because it is by this yoga alone that
one performs pure ananya-bhakti . The word çraddhä  men-
tioned in the original çloka  means staunch faith in the state-
ments of çästra , guru and Bhagavän. As it is said in Caitanya-
caritämåta  (Madhya-lélä  22.62):
çraddhä-çabdeviçväsa kahe sudåòha niçcaya
kåñëe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kåta haya
The determined faith, that merely by the performance of bhakti
to Çré Kåñëa all activities are performed, is called çraddhä .
Elsewhere it is also said: çraddhä tv anyopäya-varjaà
kåñëonmukhé citta-våtti-viçeñaù. The citta-våtti,  tendency of
the heart, which is directed only towards Kåñëa, and whichis free from any desire to follow other processes, is calledçraddhä .2! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 728
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.27) describes four types of faith:
sättviky ädhyätmiké çraddhä / karma-çraddhä tu räjasé
tämasy adharme yä çraddhä / mat-seväyäà tu nirguëä
Faith in çästra  which deals with the science of the self is sättvika ;
faith related to fruitive activities is räjasika ; faith in adharmika
acts is tämasika , and faith in My service is nirguëa .
Here it should be understood that the word nirguëa  means
transcendental and beyond material qualities  (apräkåta ). It
does not mean bereft of all qualities. Hence, a bhakti -yogé
endowed with nirguëa-çraddhä  is best. Bhagavän Çré Kåñëas
intention is to give this understanding.

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Those who worship My nirviçeña-brahma-svarüpa remain
distressed; therefore, they are inferior to My bhaktas . In or-
der to establish this principle, Çré Bhagavän speaks these twoçlokas  beginning with ye tu.  Akñara  means that brahma  can-
not be described in words, because it is unmanifest, formless(avyaktam ), all-pervading ( sarvatra-ga ) and eternal
(dhruvam ). It is not subject to transformation ( acalam ), but
exists uniformly at all times ( kuöa-stham ), and it cannot be
comprehended by logic ( acintya ). The phrase mäm eva  means,
They attain Me alone. In other words, there is no differ-ence between that imperishable ( akñara ) brahma  and Me.

Çré Bhagavän says, Those who with controlled senses and
equal vision engage in activities for the welfare of all jévas
and worship My akñara  (imperishable), anirdeçya  (indescrib-
able) and avyakta  (unmanifest) nirviçeña-brahma-svarüpa ,
ultimately attain Me only after performing troublesomesädhana.  From the çloka,  brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham  (Gétä
14.27), it is understood that Çré Kåñëa is the äçraya  (shelter)
of nirviçeña-tattva . Therefore, the worshippers of nirviçeña-
brahma  are also indirectly dependent on Çré Kåñëa. Çré Kåñëa
is the shelter of all upäsya-tattva (worshipable realities), and
is Himself the supreme worshipable object. Upäsya-tattva
includes Çré Rämacandra, Çré Näräyaëa, Çré Nåsiàhadevaand nirviçeña-brahma , who all depend on Kåñëa. Those3 - 4! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 730
wor-shippers who have taken shelter of upäsya-tattva are cer-
tainly under the shelter of Kåñëa. All  upäsya-tattva is depen-
dent on kåñëa-tattva  as their origin. Among upäsya-tattva , the
first three svarüpas are tad-ekätma-rüpa (one in tattva ), but
from the perspective of rasa,  there is a gradation. Similarly,
there is also a gradation among those worshippers who havetaken shelter of these realities. Brahma  is the effulgence of
Çré Kåñëas limbs, an incomplete manifestation of Kåñëas  cid-
aàça (internal self-conscious potency). Therefore, those who
achieve nirviçeña-brahma  or säyujya-mukti  are indirectly
dependent on Çré Kåñëa alone. However, they do not experi-ence the bliss of loving sevä,  etc. For this reason, even if Çré
Kåñëa offers His bhaktas the various types of mukti  such as
säyujya , they do not accept them, as stated in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (3.29.13):
sälokya-särñöi-sämépya- / särüpyaikatvam apy uta
déyamänaà na gåhëanti / vinä mat-sevanaà janäù
A pure devotee does not accept any kind of liberation:  sälokya,
särñöi, sämépya, särüpya or ekatvam (säyujya ), even though they
may be offered to him.
Some consider worship of akñara-brahma  to be superior
to the worship of the sac-cid-änanda-mürti  of
Çyämasundara Çré Kåñëa. However, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa isHimself very clearly explaining the superiority of Hisananya-bhaktas over those who worship niräkära  (formless)
nirviçeña-brahma . Furthermore, some persons think, Why
would worship of brahma  not be superior, since it is full of
difficulty and perfected over a long period of time? Theyconsider that of the two types of brahma , saguëa  and
nirguëa , nirguëa -niräkära -brahma  is the original and su-
perior tattva. They think that common people are unable
to perform worship of nirguëa-brahma  because it is trouble-ÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !731
some, whereas the worship of saguëa säkära , personal
brahma , is easily performed since anyone can do it. Here it
is necessary to understand that these conceptions are false.Kåñëa alone is the original tattva. Brahma-tattva is depen-
dent on Him, and is simply the effulgence of His bodilylimbs. In Gétä  (15.18), Çré Kåñëa Himself has declared that
as puruñottama-svarüpa,  He is superior to akñara (imper-
ishable) and küöa-stha (unchanging) brahma . Çré Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa and other commentators on the Gétä  explain
akñara-svarüpa  to mean jéva-svarüpa,  whereas Çré
Rämänujäcärya explains it to mean pratyag-ätma (the all-
pervading)  svarüpa .
Here the word akñara  does not mean parabrahma . The
Supreme Person,  parabrahma , has been clearly described
as different from and superior to that brahma,  which is
akñara and küöa-stha . In this regard, one should refer to
Gétä (15.16-17): küöa-stho kñara ucyate and uttamaù puruñas
tv anyaù .
Moreover, worshippers of brahma  also consider the jéva
alone to be brahma : jévo brahmaiva näparaù . They say that
when the ignorance of the jéva is dispelled, the brahma-jïäné
becomes brahma . Even if the jéva attains the stage of brahma ,
it is not stated in any çästra  that he attains the nature of
parabrahma . Çré Kåñëa alone is parabrahma . This has been
established in various statements from çruti and småti . In the
Vedänta  also it is stated that the jéva never attains the stage
of parabrahma . One should always keep in mind that the
attributes of Bhagavän described in çästra , such as saguëa ,
säkära and saviçeña , are transcendental and fully conscious.
Therefore, Çré Bhagavän is simultaneously both saguëa  and
nirguëa . Saguëa  and nirguëa  are not two separate tattvas ,
but two aspects of the same tattva.5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 732

Those whose minds are attached to the nirviçeña-brahma-

the embodied jévas to attain steadiness in that which is
unmanifest.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
How then, are the jïänés  inferior? In response to Arjunas
question, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the
words kleço dhikataras teñäm . Those who desire the experi-
ence of brahma  which is avyakta  (unmanifest) must undergo
extreme difficulty in attaining it. The senses are only ableto experience that which has attributes ( viçeña ) that pertain
to the respective senses, such as sound. They are unable toexperience that which is devoid of qualities or attributes(nirviçeña ).
It is essential for those who desire nirviçeña-jïäna  to con-
trol the senses, but to do so is as difficult as controlling the
flow of a river. As Sanat Kumära says to Påthu Mahäräja inÇrémad-Bhägavatam (4.22.39), The bhaktas can easily cut the
hådya-granthi  (knot of the heart), which consists of karma-
väsanä (fruitive desires) by remembering with devo tion theÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !733
effulgence of the toes of the lotus petal-like feet of Bhagavän.
The yogés , however, who are bereft of bhakti , are not able to
cut the knot of the heart as bhaktas  can, even though they
are free from any mundane enjoying propensity and cancontrol their senses. Therefore, give up the endeavour to con-trol the senses and so forth and engage in the bhajana of Çré
Väsudeva. Those who practise the processes of yoga, etc., with
a desire to cross this ocean of material existence, which isfull of crocodiles in the form of the senses, have to face ex-treme difficulties if they fail to take shelter of Bhagavän, whois likened to a boat. Therefore, O King, you should also ac-cept the lotus feet of the most worshipable Bhagavän as theboat in which to cross this ocean, which is insurmountableand full of obstacles.
Even if the destination of nirviçeña-brahma  is achieved after
much trouble, it happens only with the help of bhakti.  With-
out bhakti  for Bhagavän, the worshipper of brahma not only
undergoes misery, but also fails to attain brahma . As Lord
Brahmä said, The only gain of a person who beats a huskfrom which the rice has been taken is the trouble they tookto beat it ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam 10.14.4).
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Worshippers of nirviçeña-brahma  face misery both during
sädhana and siddha . No sädhana  can give perfection with-
out the help of bhakti.  Taking support of bhakti as a second-
ary process, those who worship nirviçeña-brahma strive to
achieve brahma-jïäna. In turn, Bhakti-devi awards them the
secondary result, which is brahma-jïäna , and then disap-
pears. Such persons who worship brahma,  thus, remain be-
reft of relishing the supremely beneficial name, form, pas-
times and qualities of Çré Kåñëa. They eternally submerge
themselves in an ocean of great misery in the form of säyujya-5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 734
mukti.  This is self-destructive. For this reason Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (10.14.4) states: çreyaù-såtim bhaktim udasya te
vibho.
My dear Lord, bhajana unto You is the most superior path
for realisation of the self. If someone gives up that path andengages in cultivating speculative knowledge, he will simplyundergo a troublesome process and will not achieve his de-sired ends. As a person who beats an empty husk of wheatcannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot achieveself-realisation. His only gain is trouble.
The stages of both sädhana  (practice) and sädhya  (perfec-
tion) are described as troublesome for the nirviçeña-jïänés .
On the other hand, bhakti is supremely pleasurable and aus-
picious in both stages sädhana  and sädhya . Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (4.22.39) states:
yat-päda-paìkaja-paläça-viläsa-bhaktyä
karmäçayaà grathitam udgrathayanti santaù
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo pi ruddha-
sroto-gaëäs tam araëaà bhaja väsudevam
The bhaktas ,who are always engaged in the service of the toes of
the lotus feet of Çré Bhagavän, can very easily overcome the hardknot of desires for fruitive activities. Because this is very diffi-cult, the non-devotees, jïänés  and  yogés  who endeavour to stop
the waves of sense gratification, are unable to do so. Therefore,you are advised to engage in the bhajana  of Kåñëa, the son of
Vasudeva.
And furthermore, in 12.4.40:
saàsära-sindhum ati-dustaram uttitérñor
nänyaù plavo bhagavataù puruñottamasya
lélä-kathä-rasa-niñevaëam antareëa
puàso bhaved vividha-duùkha-davärditasyaÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !735
For those who are scorching in the forest fire that generates
various types of miseries, and who desire to cross over the in-surmountable ocean of material existence, there is no other boatthan serving and relishing the nectar of the lélä-kathä  of
Puruñottama Bhagavän Çré Hari.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, The difference be-
tween a jïäné -yogé and a bhakti -yogé is that in the stage of
sädhana  a bhakti -yogé can easily cultivate the process to
achieve the supreme objective, Bhagavän, and attains thesädhya (stage of perfection) without fear of self-destruction.
On the other hand, during a jïäna -yogés  sädhana , he be-
comes fixed in avyakta-tattva  (the unmanifest reality) and
has to suffer the trouble of practising vyatireka-cintä , the
conception of negation, always thinking,Not this, not this.The vyatireka-cintä  (negative process) means to think in a
way that is opposite to the natural aptitude or constitutional
function of the jéva, so it is very troublesome for the living
entities. The stage of sädhana is also not free from fear
because the nitya-svarüpa  of Bhagavän has not been realised
before completion of the sädhana stage. Hence, the jïäna -
yogés  supreme destination is also miserable. The jéva is an
eternal conscious entity ( nitya-cinmaya-vastu ). If the jéva
becomes merged in the unmanifest state, which is suicidalfor him, his constitutional and purposeful quality of kåñëa-
däsya is destroyed. He has cultivated very deep impressions
(saàskäras ) of ahaì-graha -buddhiù  (considering oneself as
supreme) by identifying himself with brahma , so it is very
difficult for him to give up this conditioned consciousnesseven if he comes to understand that his own svarüpa  is
individual and has the constitutional nature of service.
For the embodied jéva, embarking upon meditation on
the unmanifest only results in misery, both as the means(sädhana ) and as the objective ( sädhya ). In reality, the jéva5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 736
is caitanya-svarüpa , conscious by nature, and has a spiri-
tual body. Therefore, this unmanifest or impersonal medi-tation is contrary to the jévas own svarüpa  and is simply a
source of misery. Bhakti-yoga  alone is the source of eternal
auspiciousness for the jéva. Jïäna-yoga , when bereft of bhakti
and practised independently, always becomes a source of in-auspiciousness. Therefore, adhyätma-yoga , the process of
self-realisation which is performed by worshipping theniräkära , nirvikära , sarva-vyäpé  (all-pervading) nirviçeña-
svarüpa  is not praiseworthy and does not guarantee attain-
ment of the ultimate destination.

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän says, Without jïäna , simply by bhakti  alone,
My bhaktas  are easily and blissfully freed from this material
existence. Here the word sannyäsa  means tyäga  (to give up).
Becoming free from karma , jïäna , tapasyä and other processes,
My bhakta s give up all other activities for My sake and en-
gage in worship of Me with ananya-bhakti  for the purpose
of achieving Me. Thus, they are easily and happily freed fromthe material world. As it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.32-33), Whatever result one achieves by the perfor-mance of karma , tapasyä , jïäna  and vairägya , and also what-
ever My bhakta  desires, be it Svarga,  mokña , or even residence
in My dhäma, can all be easily attained by performance of
My bhakti-yoga .
It is also said in the Näräyaëéya-mokña-dharma , The fruits
one receives from performing sädhana  to attain  the four types
of human goals ( catuù puruñärtha ), are attained by a person
who has taken refuge in Çré Näräyaëa without performingany such sädhana .
If one asks, By which sädhana  do they cross over this
material world? then listen. This question is irrelevant, be-cause I Myself deliver them, even if they do not perform anysädhana . From this statement it is understood that
Bhagavän only exhibits His vätsalya-bhäva  for His bhaktas
and not for the jïänés .6 - 7! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 738
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the previous two çlokas , Çré Bhagavän is explaining the
glories of His ananya-bhakti  and His ananya-bhakta . By
performing this ananya-bhakti  and by the mercy of
Bhagavän, an ananya-bhakta  can very easily cross over the
ocean of material existence and attain supremely blissfulprema-sevä  to Çré Bhagavän.
Kåñëa Himself is the shelter or pratiñöhä  of brahma . This
Kåñëa, Svayaà Bhagavän, is the source of Paramätmä andall other avatäras . A bhakta who knows the reality of this
svarüpa  of Bhagavän takes shelter of kevala-bhakti  in the asso-
ciation of bhaktas . He does not have to undergo the difficulties
experienced in the sädhana  and sädhya  stages as do those who
worship nirviçeña  niräkära-brahma  described above. In a very
short time, he easily attains prema-mayé sevä to Çré
Bhagavän.
In introducing the bhaktas who take shelter of such kevala-
bhakti , Çré Bhagavän says, Such one-pointed bhaktas  con-
sider their prescribed duties of varëa  and äçrama to be ob-
stacles to bhakti , and completely give them up. They con-
sider My prema-mayé sevä  to be the one and only goal to be
attained, and with ananya-bhakti  engage in My worship by
hearing, chanting and remembering My näma , rüpa , guëa
and lélä. They even become absorbed in Me during the
sädhana stage, while performing çravaëam , kértanam  and so
forth. I very quickly deliver such bhaktas , whose hearts are
attached to Me and who are fully absorbed in Me, from thisocean of material existence, which is very difficult to cross.They need not be in anxiety about crossing over it, unlikethe jïänés  and yogés . Furthermore, they are unable to toler-
ate any delay in achieving Me. Placing them on the back ofGaruòa, I very quickly carry them to My abode. They do notattain gradual mukti  through the paths of Arci (light) andÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !739
so forth, as followed by jïänés  and yogés . By My own will, I
free them from this illusory world, bring them to My abode,and engage them in My prema-mayé sevä .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, I very
quickly deliver from the ocean of material existence,characterised by birth and death, those who take shelter ofMy bhagavat-svarüpa  (personal feature). Making all bodily
and social activities completely subordinate to My bhakti,  and
always meditating upon and worshipping My nitya-çré-
vigraha , the eternal, beautiful human-like form of Kåñëa, by
the process of My ananya-bhakti , their hearts, thus, become
completely absorbed in Me. In other words, in their condi-tioned state, I give them liberation from the bondage of thisillusory material existence. After their bondage of mäyä  has
been cut, I protect them from the suicidal attempt of adopt-ing the conception of oneness. This self-destructive concep-tion of oneness in people whose minds are attached to the
unmanifest is the cause of inauspiciousness for them. My vow
is: ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham
(Gétä 4.11). From this it is understood that those who medi-
tate on the avyakta  (unmanifest) become merged in the
avyakta-svarüpa . What is My loss in this? Having attained
such a destination, the jévas who have the suicidal concep-
tion of oneness lose the importance or utility of their ownsvarüpa . In other words, they become deprived of the eter-
nal bliss of My loving service.

Since My bhakti  is the topmost process, you should per-
form bhakti  only. To instruct Arjuna in this way, Çré
Bhagavän is speaking three çlokas  beginning here with mayy
eva. Worship of the nirviçeña-svarüpa  has been prohibited by
use of the word eva. Çré Bhagavän says mayi , meaning upon
Me. You should fix your mind exclusively on MyÇyämasundara form, which is decorated with yellow gar-ments ( pétämbara-dhäré ) and a beautiful forest garland
(vana-mälä ). In other words, remember Me and engage your
pure intelligence in Me, that is, think of Me alone. Thisthinking should be in accordance with the statements ofçästra  that establish dhyäna (meditation). Then you will live
only with Me, who am described in the Vedas .

Here in these few çlokas  Çré Kåñëa is explaining the sädhana-
praëälé , or the process of practice adopted by His ananya-
bhaktas . First of all He said to Arjuna, O Arjuna, I very
quickly deliver from the ocean of birth and death, My ananya-
bhakta  who surrenders to Me and who has given up
varëäçrama-dharma , and bestow upon him My prema-mayé
sevä. Therefore, you should fix your mind exclusively on Me,ÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !741
parabrahma , the Supreme Transcendental Reality. Remov-
ing all desires for sense gratification from your citta (thoughts),
absorb your citta in Me alone. The mind has the tendencies of
accepting ( saìkalpa ) and rejecting ( vikalpa ), so to fix it in ob-
jects related with Bhagavän, it is necessary to surrender onesintelligence to Him after disengaging the mind from all senseobjects. Acquiring knowledge of Bhagaväns  svarüpa  with ones
vyavasäyätmikä buddhi  (resolute intelligence), know Him
alone to be the supreme worshipable reality. Direct the func-tions of the pure intelligence towards Him, by performingsädhana  such as çravaëam , kértanam  and smaraëam.  By do-
ing so, the mind will be under the control of such resoluteintelligence and will automatically become absorbed inthoughts of Him. In such a state, you will always live near Him.
Therefore, by making Arjuna His instrument, Çré Bhagavän
is instructing us all that bhakti  alone is the best sädhana  and
the best sädhya . Thus it is imperative to constantly remem-
ber the nitya-svarüpa  of Çyämasundara by fixing the mind
on Him and surrendering ones intelligence exclusively toHim. When this is done, one will attain the highest fruit ofsädhana-bhakti and become His associate, attaining
nirupädhika-prema  (unalloyed love). There is no doubt about
this. Thus, it is explained that the destination achieved bybhakti-yoga  is superior to all others.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
For the benefit of those who cannot directly remember Him,
Çré Bhagavän explains the means whereby perfection of suchremembrance can be achieved. He says, By time and againcontrolling the mind, which runs from one place to another,one should practise concentrating it exclusively on My form.This is yoga. One should gradually fix the minds course on
My most beautiful form, qualities and so forth, by this prac-tice of completely checking the flow of the mind which flowslike a river towards abominable mundane sense objects, suchas form and taste.
The present çloka emphasises the word Dhanaïjaya. Just
as Arjuna has accumulated a lot of dhana  (wealth) by con-
quering many enemies, in the same way, he is also able toachieve the wealth of dhyäna  (meditation on Bhagavän) by
conquering and controlling his mind.

In the previous çloka,  Çré Bhagavän instructs everyone to
become one-pointedly devoted to Him by exclusively fixingtheir minds and intelligence on Him. Thus, the followingquestion may be raised: Just as the Gaìgä flows towards theocean, those whose mano-våtti  (attitude or flow of mind) is
always running with great speed towards Çré Bhagavän canvery quickly attain Him; of this there is no doubt. By whatmeans, however, can Bhagavän be achieved by those who doÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !743
not have such strong citta-våtti  (flow of thoughts or feelings)
towards Him? In response to this, Çré Bhagavän has given asecond option. Those who are unable to firmly and steadily
fix their mind on Me by the previously stated means should
try to achieve Me by abhyäsa-yoga . This means that they
should try to fix the mind on Me by gradually curbing thetendency of the mind to become attracted to various senseobjects. Such endeavour is called abhyäsa-yoga . By this
abhyäsa-yoga , the mind slowly becomes attached to Me, af-
ter which attaining Me becomes easy.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, That

Çré Kåñëa, smiling, gave a third option. If one is even un-

activities performed in the service of Çré Bhagavän, to HisDeity and His temple, such as building, maintaining andcleaning temples or making a flower-garden and caring forTulasé, which can be done with very little effort, the mindeasily becomes controlled and fixed in meditating on activi-ties which are related to Bhagavän.

Çré Bhagavän says, If you are unable to do this, then take
shelter of My bhakti-yoga  and renounce the results of all
actions by offering them to Me (as described in the first six
chapters).
The first six chapters explain niñkäma-karma -yoga, activi-
ties offered to Bhagavän, as the means to attain mokña . The
second six chapters describe bhakti-yoga  as the means to at-
tain Bhagavän. This bhakti-yoga  is of two types: 1) the ac-
tions of the internal senses which are steadily fixed onBhagavän, and (2) the activities of the external senses. Thefirst type of bhakti-yoga is further divided into three catego-
ries: (1)  smaraëa (remembrance), (2)  manana  (meditation)
and (3)  abhyäsa , the practice of those who are unable to con-
stantly remember but who are attached to attaining such astage. These three practices are indeed very difficult for thosewho are less intelligent, but they are easy for those who arefree from offences and devoted to pure intelligence. However,the second type of bhakti -yoga, which engages the activities
of the external senses (as previously described) in hearing,chanting and so forth, is an easy means for everyone. Thosewho are engaged in either of these two types of bhakti-yoga
are superior to all others. This is described in the second sixchapters of Bhagavad-gétä. Those who are unable to perform
either of these, and who cannot worship Çré Bhagavän faith-fully by controlling their senses and minds, are qualified toperform niñkäma -karma -yoga  offered to Bhagavän, as de-
scribed in the first six chapters. They are inferior to the abovetwo types of bhakti-yogés .

In the previous çloka , in the statement mat-karma-paramo
bhava , Çré Kåñëa gave instructions to clean His temple, waterÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !747
Tulasé and the flower-gardens, and so forth. After hearing
this, Arjuna wondered what should someone do who con-siders these services to Bhagavän, which are simple, easyand happily performed, to be insignificant and is unwillingto perform them on account of having taken birth in a highfamily or being a respected person in society. In the presentçloka,  Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, understanding Arjunas mano-
bhäva  (mind), gives the fourth option. If one is unable to
perform such simple services for Çré Bhagavän, then the onlymeans is to adopt the process of bhagavad-arpita  niñkäma -
karma -yoga , selfless work offered to Bhagavän. However,
it is not proper to avoid the performance of services such ascleaning the temple because of ones material false ego. Al-though King Ambaréña was the lord of the earths seven is-lands, he constantly remained engaged in the service of ÇréBhagavän by cleaning the temple with his own hands andperforming other services. According to Çré Caitanya-
caritämåta , King Pratäparudra would sweep in front of Çré
Jagannätha Devas chariot during the Rathayäträ festivalin Jagannätha Puré. Upon seeing such a service attitude, ÇréCaitanya Mahäprabhu became very pleased with him.Therefore, according to the instructions of our guru-varga ,
to perform even an insignificant service to Çré Bhagavän ismost auspicious for us. To think sevä,  such as cleaning the
temple, is insignificant, and to consider oneself superiorbecause of material false ego, causes falldown from pursu-ance of the transcendental goal.
If, because of such a superiority complex, one is unable to
engage in sevä as instructed by Bhagavän, then for him the
most compassionate Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa is giving anotheroption. He should perform his prescribed duties according tovarëäçrama-dharma,  without desiring to enjoy the fruits of
his karma , and he should offer the results to Bhagavän.11! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 748
Çré Bhagavän has given four sequential options in descend-
ing order for persons possessing four types of adhikära :
1) By fixing ones mind on the svarüpa  of Bhagavän, one
should try to achieve nirupädhika-prema  through the pro-
cess of çravaëa , kértana and smaraëa  of the näma , rüpa , guëa
and lélä of Bhagavän. This is the path of rägänuga-bhakti ,
natural attachment.
2) For those who are unable to absorb the mind in Bhagavän
through the path of attachment, it is better to take shelterof abhyäsa -yoga by following the path of vaidhi-bhakti .
3) For those who are unable to perform even this abhyäsa -
yoga in the form of vaidhi-bhakti , it is necessary to become
devoted to performing work (service) for Bhagavän. In thisway, while being devoted to working for Bhagavän, they willgradually attain perfection in abhyäsa -yoga,  and eventually
the mind will become fixed at the lotus feet of Çré Bhagavän.
4) For those who are unable to even perform karma  (ac-
tion) in service to Çré Bhagavän, it is better to become sur-
rendered to Him and perform that karma  prescribed in the
Vedas , offering Him the fruits of all their actions.
As a result of such actions, one will gradually  (step by step)
attain the path leading to parä bhakti , which imparts knowl-
edge of ones own svarüpa  and that of Bhagavän.

Better than abhyäsa  is the jïäna that gives rise
to contem-plation upon Me. Superior to jïäna  is
dhyäna , that meditation by which I am constantly
remembered. Such dhyäna  then leads to renuncia-
tion of the fruits of ones actions, whereby onebecomes freed from the desires to enjoy Svarga and
attain 
mokña , and thus achieves peace of mind.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Now, while explaining the gradation of abhyäsa , manana
and smaraëa in ascending order, Çré Bhagavän speaks this
çloka  beginning with çreyaù . Jïäna  means to absorb your
intelligence in Me, because such manana (contemplation)
of Me is superior to abhyäsa . In abhyäsa , dhyäna  (medita-
tion) requires endeavour and is troublesome, as there are ob-stacles, but when one reaches the stage of manana , dhyäna
becomes easy. This is the superiority of jïäna . Superior to
jïäna , however, is dhyäna . If one asks why, the answer is
that dhyäna  leads to karma-phala-tyäga , that is, it even
dispells the desires for the results of actions, such as the
pleasures of Svarga and attainment of the result of niñkäma-
karma  (mokña ). Even if they become available of their own
accord, one neglects them. Bhaktas who have not achieved
stablility in dhyäna , in whose hearts rati has not been
aroused, desire to give up the pursuit of liberation ( mokña-
tyäga ). However, those who have attained stability in
dhyäna do not even have the desire to give up  mokña , be-
cause they disregard it naturally. Only bhakti  of this type
is called mokña-laghutä-käriëé  (that which derides even12! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 750
mokña ). It has been described in Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu
(1.12) , in the çloka  beginning with the four words kleça-ghné
çubha-dä , Devotional service destroys miseries and bestows
auspiciousness.
It is also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.14.14):
na pärameñöhyaà na mahendra-dhiñëyaà
na särvabhaumaà na rasädhipatyam
na yoga-siddhér apunar-bhavaà vä
mayy arpitätmecchati mad vinänyat
Those who have surrendered their hearts to Me do not desire the
positions of Brahmä or Indra, sovereignty over the whole earth,the kingdom of the lower planets, mystic perfections such as aëimä ,
or even the state of liberation. They desire nothing but Me.
The phrase mayy arpitätmecchati in the above quoted
Bhägavatam çloka  means, To be steadfast in My dhyäna .
The word tyägät in the present  çloka means, One becomes
peaceful only when he is free from material desires. Thismeans that besides being attracted to My form, qualities andso on, ones senses become detached from all other senseobjects.

Within these three types of bhakti namely smaraëa  (re-
membrance), manana  (contemplation) and abhyäsa  (prac-
tice) jïäna in the form of manana  (placing ones intelli-
gence in Çré Bhagavän), is superior to abhyäsa .
Superior to jïäna in the form of manana  is dhyäna , which
is characterised by smaraëa  (rememberance) . This is because,
in that jïäna  which is characterised by manana , one only
achieves dhyäna  with great endeavour and trouble. But when
one becomes perfect in manana , then dhyäna  (smaraëa ) is
achieved easily. When one becomes perfect in dhyäna , hisÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !751
desires for the pleasures of Svarga and mokña are dispelled.
When desires for sense enjoyment and mokña are dispelled,
the mind becomes attached to the form, qualities, etc., ofBhagavän. In such a state, one becomes detached from allother sense objects, and thus one naturally attains peace. Butif one has not attained perfection in dhyäna,  then such a
sädhaka  who is also unable to perform abhyäsa  (the practice)
of dhyäna  should engage in niñkäma -karma -yoga  which is
offered to Bhagavän. By this process one can gradually per-form bhakti  to Bhagavän with a peaceful mind.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, sädhana-bhakti is the only means to attain
nirupädhika-prema (unalloyed love) . This bhakti-yoga  is of
two types: 1) the activities of the internal sense, the mindthat is fixed on Bhagavän; and 2) the activities of the exter-nal senses. The activities of the internal sense, the mind whichis fixed on Bhagavän, is of three types: smaraëa  (remembrance),
manana  (contemplation) and abhyäsa  (practice), but for less
intelligent people, these three types of activities are very dif-ficult to perform. The second type of bhakti , the actions of
the external senses in the form of hearing and chanting, iseasily performed by everyone. Therefore, manana , intelli-
gence in relation to Me, is the superior jïäna , and is better
than abhyäsa . Here, jïäna  does not refer to jïäna-yoga .
During abhyäsa,  one performs dhyäna  with endeavour, but
when one achieves the result of abhyäsa,  which is manana ,
dhyäna  is easily performed. Dhyäna  is superior to mere jïäna ,
because, when dhyäna  becomes stable, one becomes free from
the desire to enjoy either the pleasures of Svarga or the hap-piness of mokña . When both of these desires are dispelled,
one achieves peace in the form of detachment from all senseobjects, but not detachment from My transcendental form,qualities, etc.12! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 752

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
What is the nature of the bhaktas  who have attained the
aforementioned stage of peace? Expecting this question from
Arjuna, Çré Bhagavän is explaining the various qualities of His
different types of bhaktas in eight çlokas , the first of which
begins with the word adveñöä . A person who is not envious of
one who envies him, but instead maintains a friendly attitudetowards him, is called adveñöä . Desiring that such a discon-
tented person should not become degraded or fall down due tohis envious attitude, bhaktas  feel only compassion for him. If
someone questions how, and with what type of discrimina-tion one can show friendship and compassion towards anenvious person, the answer is that these moods exist naturallywithin the bhaktas, who do not  discriminate. Because My
bhakta is nirmamaù , meaning that he does not have a feeling
of possessiveness towards son, wife and so forth, and does notfalsely identify with the body, he is free from envy towardsanyone. Furthermore, why should he discriminate when, bynot doing so, he can avoid the misery arising from envy? Onemay wonder if he would feel any bodily pain if another per-son ran at him or beat him with shoes or a fist. In responseBhagavän says: sama-duùkha-sukhaù. He remains even-
minded both in happiness and in misery.
As Candrärdha Çekhara (Lord Çiva) says in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam (6.17.28):  närärayaëa-parah sarve na . Those who
are devoted to Çré Näräyaëa do not fear anyone because theysee Svarga,  mokña and naraka (hell) as equal. To see happi-
ness and distress as equal is called sama-darçitva . Moreover,
they think that any misery coming to them is the result of theirprärabdha-karma,  it must be faced. Becoming equipoised, they
endure all misery with great tolerance. To convey this, ÇréBhagavän says that they are kñamé,  or forgiving. The root word
kñam  is used in the sense of tolerance.13 - 14! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 754
If the question is raised as to how such bhaktas maintain
their lives, the response is santuñöaù , that is, they remain
satisfied with whatever eatables they get by the will ofprovidence or with little endeavour. Arjuna asked, But ear-lier You said that they are even-minded both in misery andhappiness, satisfied even if they face the hardship of notgetting any food, so how can it be that they feel satisfactionwhen attaining food for themselves? This seems contradic-tory. In response Çré Bhagavän says: satataà yogé. Being
endowed with bhakti-yoga,  they want to maintain their bod-
ies simply to attain perfection in bhakti . As it is said, One
must endeavour to acquire food to maintain ones life. Suchmaintenance of the body is proper, because only by keepingthe body healthy can one think of the Absolute, and by spe-cific knowledge of the Absolute, one can attain brahma . If,
by the will of providence, they do not get anything to eat,they remain undisturbed ( yatätmä ). And if they have to face
a situation that disturbs their minds, they still do not en-
gage in the practice of añöäìga-yoga  to pacify it. For this
reason, they are known as dåòha-niçcayaù , that is, they never
deviate from their sole purpose of attaining ananya-bhakti
to Bhagavän. They remain devoted to remembrance of andcontemplation on Bhagavän. Such bhaktas are dear to Me,
as they act in such a way that is pleasing to Me.

In previous çlokas,  after explaining the various types of
sädhana practised by aikäntika (one-pointed) and sa-niñöhita
(steadfast) bhaktas , Çré Bhagavän is explaining their quali-
ties in the next seven çlokas . Here, the word adveñöä  means
that they do not even envy those who are envious of them.
They think that such envy of  them is the result of their
prärabdha-karma as given by Parameçvara and therefore
they envy no one. Rather, considering everyone as theÇLOKA BHAKTI -YOGA !755
dwelling place of Parameçvara, they maintain a friendly
attitude towards all. Upon seeing the misery of others, theytry to remove it, whatever the cause may be; therefore, theyare compassionate. They consider the body and anythingrelated to the body as transformations of material nature anddifferent from their ätma-svarüpa  (own self); thus they do
not even have a feeling of possessiveness toward their ownbodies, and while performing their activities, they remain freefrom false bodily identification. When they have to facematerial happiness and distress, they become neither elatednor disturbed as they are steady in both. Because they areforgiving, they are also tolerant. Since they remain contentin all situations of loss or gain, fame or infamy, victory ordefeat, they are yogés  and remain steadily fixed in the
sädhana  given to them by Çré Gurudeva. The word yatätmä
means one who has control over the senses. Since they can-not be disturbed by any false logic, their determination is firm.
In this material world, no misery can deviate them from
bhagavad-bhakti . This is the special quality of aikäntika-
bhaktas.  They are endowed with the firm faith that, I am
the servant of Bhagavän, and their mind, body and every-thing else is surrendered unto the lotus feet of Çré Bhagavän.Therefore, such bhaktas are dear to Him. In Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.11.29-32), Çré Kåñëa describes these qualities
to His devotee Uddhava. They are also described inCaitanya-caritämåta , Madhya-lélä  (22.78-80).

Moreover, in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (5.18.12) it is said, The

ments of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also confirm that all the good
qualities which please Çré Bhagavän arise naturally by con-tinuous abhyäsa (practice of His bhakti ). Now hear those
qualities in five çlokas , the first beginning with yasmät . My
bhakta  is free from mundane elation, intolerance, etc. While
explaining the rarity of qualities like these, Çré Bhagavänfurther says:  yo na håñyati , etc. ( Gétä 12.17).

In these çlokas,  Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa is describing other
qualities which naturally manifest in the bhaktas by the
influence of bhakti . As I said previously, there is no possi-

since they are free from the tendency to be violent towards

Çré Kåñëa now concludes His glorification of the natural
qualities of His dear bhaktas  in the present two çlokas . They
behave equally towards enemies and friends, and they remainequipoised in honour and dishonour, heat and cold and hap-piness and distress. They are not attached to any bad associa-tion, and do not feel unhappy when criticised or happy whenglorified. They do not speak anything except bhagavat-kathä .
They remain content with either palatable or unpalatablefoodstuffs which are useful for the maintenance of the bodyand which come by the will of Bhagavän. They do not residein one place, and their intelligence is fixed and focused on thetranscendental goal. Such bhaktas are dear to Him.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
While concluding His description of the characteristics in
which His bhaktas are steadily fixed, Çré Bhagavän is explain-
ing the result for those who hear, study or meditate on these
instructions with a desire to attain them. These characteris-tics are all born of bhakti and bring peace. They are not
material qualities. It is said: bhaktyä tuñyati kåñëo na guëaiù.
Kåñëa is pleased only by bhakti , not by any material quali-
ties. There are unlimited statements like this in the çästra .
Here the word tu (but) is used to show a different subject.
Bhaktas who have the above-stated characteristics are fixed
in certain good qualities. But bhakti sädhakas  who desire all
these qualities are superior to perfected mystics and those whohave perfected jïäna . The word atéva  has been used here to
indicate this.
Bhakti  is supreme, pleasurable and the most easily achiev-
able among all sädhyas (goals). In this chapter, many such
qualities of bhakti  have been delineated. Jïäna  has been de-
scribed as nimba (a bitter lemon) and bhakti as dräkña (sweet
grapes). Sädhakas  who are greedy for their respective tastes
accept a particular one, according to their desires.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä,
by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, on theTwelfth Chapter of
Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä, which gives pleasure to the bhaktas
and is accepted by all saintly persons.

In concluding this chapter, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa says, Those
who are devoted to Me and endowed with faith thoroughly
worship this dharmämåta , the nectarean dharma  of immor-
tality, as described by Me. Such bhaktas of Mine are very dear
to Me. Bhagavän is only pleased by bhakti , not merely by a20! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  12 762
persons qualities. All good qualities naturally manifest in
bhaktas by the influence of bhakti.  There is no possibility of
good qualities arising in non-devotees who are averse to Hari.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (5.18.12) says:
yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä
sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù
haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëä
manorathenäsati dhävato bahiù
All the devatäs  along with their superior qualities become mani-
fest in the body of one who has developed unalloyed bhakti to
Çré Bhagavän. On the other hand, a person who is devoid ofbhakti  and engaged in material activities has no good qualities.
He is driven by his own mental speculations, and must submit
to the Lords external potency. How can there be any good quali-
ties in such a man?
Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has written that the intention of the
Twelfth Chapter is to determine which is the superior worshipof Çré Bhagavän, nirguëa  (impersonal) or saguëa  (personal).
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa writes, Among the various
types of  sädhana , only çuddha-bhakti , which is supremely
effective and performed without any trouble, quickly bestowsattainment of Bhagavän. This is the essence of this chapter.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Those
who are devoted to Me faithfully worship, hear, study, con-template and practise this dharmämåta  as described by Me
from beginning to end. They are, indeed, My bhaktas and
therefore are very dear to Me. A jéva attains nirupädhika-
prema  (pure love free from all motivation) by following this
gradual, step-by-step process, as described by Me.

Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä consists of eighteen chapters, which
have been divided into three divisions. The first six chaptersdescribe niñkäma -karma -yoga, bhakti-miçra-jïäna and top-

Paramätmä. The second set of six chapters explains the gloryof kevala-bhakti , deliberates on parä and aparä bhakti,  and
describes the glory of Çré Bhagaväns svarüpa,  as well as the
glory of the svarüpa  of the bhakta.  It also explains the speci-
ality and supremacy of bhakti among various processes, and
gives details of other similar topics. T attva-jïäna  is explained
in detail in the third set of six chapters. It was previouslydescribed only in brief. The present description is part of adeliberation on prakåti (material nature), puruña  (the

delivered in the Eighteenth Chapter.
In the first çloka  of this chapter, Arjuna is inquiring about
the principles such as prakåti, puruña, kñetra, kñetra-jïa, jïäna
and jïeya , however, some commentators have purposely

as kñetra  (the field), and one who knows this body
is called kñetra-jïa  (the knower of the field), by
those endowed with knowledge of kñetra  and kñetra-
jïa.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
What is kñetra  and who is kñetra-jïa ? In reply to this ques-
tion, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the word
idam . This body is the refuge of all sense enjoyment through
the medium of the senses and is indeed called kñetra.  In other
words, it is the origin of the tree of material existence. Those! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 766
in bondage are covered by the misconception, of I and mine
in relation to their bodies. This is generated by the false ego.
They are freed from this misconception however, in the lib-erated stage. In other words, they remain free from attach-ment to the body when they are liberated. The jéva situated
in either of these stages is known as kñetra-jïa . Like a farmer,
he alone is kñetra-jïa , the knower of his field, and the enjoyer
of its fruits.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.12.23) Çré Bhagavän says:
adanti caikaà phalam asya gådhrä
gräme-carä ekam araëya-väsäù
haàsä ya ekaà bahu-rüpam ijyair
mäyä-mayaà veda sa veda vedam
Those ignorant conditioned souls who are greedy to acquire
sense objects experience misery as one of the fruits of this treeof material existence. Places like Svarga are also ultimately mis-erable. However swan-like mukta-jévas  (liberated souls) who live
in the tree enjoy another type of fruit, namely the happiness ofmukti which is always blissful. Thus, the one tree of material
existence leads to various destinations such as Svarga, Naraka(hell) and mukti.  This tree, therefore, is seen to be composed of
mäyä (illusion) and it has multiple forms because it is born from
mäyä çakti.  Only those who accept a sad-guru  understand this
secret, and it is they who actually know kñetra  and kñetra-jïa .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
After hearing Arjunas questions, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa de-
scribes the body of the conditioned jéva which, along with his
life air and senses, is the place of enjoyment and is called thekñetra . One who knows this body understands that it is the
means of enjoyment for those in the conditioned state, andthe means of attaining liberation for those in the stage ofmokña . The jéva situated in either of these states is called kñetra-ÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !767
jïa. However, Çré Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa says:  çarérätmävädé
tu kñetrajïo na / na kñetratvena tat jïänäbhävät.  That jéva
who identifies himself with this body does not understand thetattva  of the body. Therefore, he is not kñetra-jïa .
Those who accept this body as their self consider it to be a
means of enjoyment only. Intoxicated by the material falseego, they become bound to saàsära  (material existence). Life
after life, their only attainment is misery. On the contrary,those who become free from the materialistic ego while re-maining in this body, and who render service to Çré Hari,gradually attain the happiness of mokña.  They become suc-
cessful after attaining the bliss of rendering service toBhagavän. This has been confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.12.23):
adanti caikaà phalam asya gådhrä
gräme-carä ekam araëya-väsäù
haàsä ya ekaà bahu-rüpam ijyair
mäyä-mayaà veda sa veda vedam
Those attached to family life and who hanker after mundane plea-
sures, taste only the miserable fruit of bodily enjoyment, whilethe wise and swan-like sannyäsés , who have renounced all mate-
rial goals, taste only the blissful fruit of transcendental happiness.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura writes, Çré Bhagavän says: O
Arjuna! To make you clearly understand bhakti-tattva , which
is supremely confidential, I first explained the svarüpa  of the
ätmä. I then explained the various types of activities ( karma )
of the baddha-jévas  and the svarüpa  (nature) of nirupädhika -

alise the highest end, I concluded with a presentation on thethree types of abhidheya  (means):  jïäna , karma  and bhakti .

While instructing the catuù-çloké  to Brahmä, I described four
subjects: jïäna  (knowledge), vijïäna  (realised knowledge),
rahasya  (confidential or secret topics) and tad-aìga  (the limbs
or various aspects of those confidential topics). The hiddenmeaning of bhakti-tattva does not manifest in the heart without
properly understanding these four essential topics. Therefore, Iam giving you the pure intelligence which is needed to under-stand this rahasya, along with instructions on vijïäna . When
viçuddha-bhakti  arises, causeless knowledge and renunciation
appear side by side. These are the two concomitant fruits expe-rienced while engaging in bhakti . O Kaunteya, this body is called
kñetra and those who know this kñetra  are called kñetra-jïa .

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Thus, the living entity is called kñetra-jïa  because he has
knowledge of kñetra (the body), but Paramätmä completely
knows all kñetras , more so than the jévas.  This çloka,  begin-
ning with the word kñetra-jïam,  explains His kñetra-jïatva
(quality of knowing the kñetra ). Çré Bhagavän says, Know
Me, Paramätmä, to be kñetra-jïa  who is situated as the con-
troller in all kñetras . The jéva is the kñetra-jïa  only of his
individual kñetra , and his knowledge of kñetra is also incom-
plete. I alone am the perfect and complete knower of all
kñetras . Consider this to be My speciality.
What is jïäna ? Anticipating this question, Çré Bhagavän
says, Knowledge of kñetra (the body) along with kñetra-jïa
(the jévätmä  and Paramätmä), is indeed called jïäna . I ac-
cept this as actual knowledge.
Paramätmä is the superior of the two puruñas , or kñetra-
jïas.  Some persons explain that there is only one ätmä.  This
is rejected here, and it also contradicts a later statement of
the Gétä (15.17).
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Although the word kñetra-jïa  was used in the previous
çloka  to indicate the embodied soul or the jéva situated within
the body, in the present çloka  Çré Bhagavän, who is sarva-
antaryämé  (the indwelling witness in all), sarveçvara (the Lord
of all), sarva-niyantä  (the Supreme Controller) and
Paramätmä, explains the perfect kñetra-jïa,  not the jéva.
The essence of Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëas commentary
on this çloka is as follows: The jéva remains situated in this
body just as a subject is situated under a king, even though he
is kñetra-jïa and has knowledge of his own kñetra  as a means
of enjoyment and liberation. However, I alone am his con-
troller and maintainer, and, thus, I am the perfect kñetra-jïa
because I know all kñetras.  Thus, I remain situated like a king.3! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 770
It is also seen in the småti :
kñeträëi hi çaréräëi / béjaà cäpi çubhäçubhe
täni vetti sa yogätmä / tataù kñetra-jïa ucyate
The entire body is like a kñetra , and righteous and unrighteous
actions are like the seeds of that body in that they are the cause.That yogätma puruña  (Paramätmä) knows the tattva  (essence) of
all bodies or kñetras.  He is therefore called the perfect kñetra-jïa .
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (8.3.13) also says:
kñetra-jïäya namas tubhyaà / sarvädhyakñäya säkñiëe
puruñäyätma-müläya / müla-prakåtaye namaù
In his commentary on this çloka,  Çréla Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura writes: kñetraà dehadvayaà tattvena
jänätéti kñetrajïo antaryämé. Antaryämé knows the tattva
of both the subtle and gross bodies and is called kñetra-jïa .
Furthermore, Çré Bhagavän says in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(8.17.11): kñetra-jïaù sarva bhütänäm One who knows all
living beings is called kñetra-jïa .
The import of Çré Kåñëas statement is that true knowl-
edge means to have knowledge of kñetra (the body), its knower
(the jévätmä  conditioned or liberated) and Paramätmä (the
original kñetra-jïa ), who is situated within all. However,
Paramätmä svarüpa  is different from the baddha-jévas (kñara )
and the mukta  jévas (akñara ) and superior to them. There-
fore, the imaginary conception that the jévätmä  and
Paramätmä are one is against the conclusion of çästra . Also
the çruti statement, nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm eko
bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän , describes Paramätmä as be-
ing superior to all living, conscious, eternal jévas and their
controller and prompter. This conclusion is verified through-out the Gétä . Çré Kåñëa says to Arjuna, Because you are a
jéva, you forget this fact again and again, but as Parameçvara,
I never forget it. According to the statement, mamaiväàçoÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !771
jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù , the jéva is an insignificant
part of Bhagavän. The jéva is eternally His part, and in no
state can he become one with Bhagavän by merging with Him.
The statement that brahma  Himself has become a jéva due
to ignorance and when freed from ignorance, the jéva be-
comes brahma,  is also incorrect from the perspective of rea-
soning, logic and çästra.  Ignorance can never touch
parabrahma  who remains jïäna-svarüpa  (intrinsically quali-
fied as knowledge) in all states. It is said in the çruti: satyaà
jïänam anantaà brahma.  Parabrahma never falls into ig-
norance by being overpowered by mäyä.  Thousands of Vedic
statements give evidence of this. So in this material body
there are two kñetra-jïas: the jévätmä  and Paramätmä.
Paramätmä is the controller, prompter and imminent witness
of the different jévas who are situated in different bodies as
localised kñetra-jïas . Paramätmä and the jéva can never be
one.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, In
regard to kñetra  (the field) and kñetra-jïa  (the knower of the
field), there are three principles: Éçvara, the jéva and jaòa (inert
matter). Just as there is one kñetra-jïa  (the jévätmä ) in each
body, know Me, Éçvara, to be the principal kñetra-jïa  of this
entire inert world. By My aiçé- çakti  (controlling potency) as
Paramätmä, I am the kñetra-jïa  of all kñetra-jïas  and of the
universe. The jïäna  of those who have understood these three
principles by deliberating on kñetra  and kñetra-jïa  is indeed
vijïäna .

In this çloka  beginning with the words tat kñetram, Çré
Bhagavän is beginning to elaborate on the meaning whichwas previously only spoken of in brief. What is that kñetra
or body? It is a combination of five elements ( mahäbhüta ),
the life air ( präëa ) and the senses ( indriya ). Hear from Me
how this kñetra  (field consisting of a gross and subtle body)
possesses different types of natures, desires and transforma-tions such as enmity and friendship. Hear how it is born fromthe union of prakåti (material nature)  and puruña  (the
enjoyer), and how it manifests differently in varieties ofmoving and non-moving forms. That kñetra-jïa  is the jévätmä
and also Paramätmä. According to the rules of Sanskritgrammar, kñetra-jïa  is in the neutral gender here because the
word kñetra is used in the neutral gender.

described in the Brahma-sütra in sütras  (aphorisms) such
as, athäto brahma-jijïäsä. Therefore one should enquire
about brahma  (Brahma-sütra  1.1.1). Since brahma , the
Supreme Absolute Truth, is substantiated by these sütras,
they are known as pada (that which gives evidence to es-
tablish Him) . What is the nature of that brahma ? In re-
sponse to this question, Çré Bhagavän explains, This spe-cifically addresses the objections of the hetuka-gana  (seers
who investigate the cause and effect of the universe). Thisis evident by deliberating upon the truth of the substantialimports of Brahma-sütra,  ikñhate näçabdam, The Supreme
Lord is not indescribable, ( Brahma sütra 1.1.5) and
änandamayo bhyäsät, By nature the Supreme Lord is bliss-
ful ( Brahma-sütra  1.1.12).5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 774

The tattva  of kñetra  and its kñetra-jïa , as explained by Çré
Kåñëa, is accepted by all philosophers. This siddhänta  is clearly
established in authoritative çästras  such as the Vedas , the
Upaniñads  and the Brahma-sütras . The Vedas  are apauruñeya
(not created by a conditioned person) so they are accepted
by everyone. The essence of the Vedas  is called Vedänta  (the
Upaniñads ).
Çré Kåñëa Dvaipäyana Vedavyäsa, an avatära  of Bhagavän,
reconciled the seemingly contradictory statements of the Vedas
and presented them in the form of sütras  known as the Vedänta-
sütra . Statements of the Vedänta-sütras  such as ikñate
näçabdam  (Brahma-sütra  1.1.5) and änandamayo bhyäsät
(Brahma-sütra  1.1.12) confirm this conclusion.  Ikñate näçabdam
means that brahma  can be seen and experienced only though
çästra because He is na açabdam.  This means that He cannot
be known ( na) other than through words ( açabdam ). That is
to say, He is knowable only through çabda (words) . This is
explained in  Brahma-sütra  (1.1.3): çästra-yonitvät. Brahma  can
be known and experienced through çästra . Brahma  is the sub-
ject matter established by the Vedas ; therefore, He is not be-
yond çabda  (words). How is He experienced? In response to
this question, it is further said: änandamayo bhyäsät.
Paramänanda-maya brahma, whose very natur e is supr eme bliss,
can be seen and experienced by the practice of bhakti . These
statements establish parabrahma  as the perfect or com plete
kñetra-jïa  and the jéva who sees or experiences Him, or who
performs bhakti  to that änandamaya-puruña  as the partial
or secondary kñetra-jïa . Furthermore, according to Brahma-
sütra  (2.3.16): nätmä çruter nityatväc ca täbhyaù . The jévas are
described as the partial kñetra-jïas. According to Brahma-
sütra  (2.3.39): parät tu tac chruteù Parabrahma  is accepted
as the complete kñetra-jïa and is superior to the jévätmä .ÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !775
In this çloka,  the chanda (Sanskrit metre) and the litera-

(being conscious of ätma-tattva ), vijïänamaya (being con-
scious of practical service to Kåñëa) and änandamaya (only
being conscious of blissful Rädhä-Kåñëa sevä). The first three
(annamaya , präëamaya  and jïänamaya ) represent the inert
kñetra (material body). Different from them is the
vijïänamaya-puruña , the jéva who, as the knower of the
kñetra  (this material body), is the secondary kñetra-jïa .
Antaryämé, the Supersoul of everyone, is distinct from thesetwo and He is the änandamaya-puruña . This änandamaya -
puruña  is, indeed, Parameçvara (the Supreme Controller),
sarva-niyantä  (the regulator of everything), säkñé  (the wit-
ness) and the original kñetra-jïa.

Çré Bhagavän is now explaining the nature of the kñetra.
Earth, water, fire, air and sky, their cause (the false ego),buddhiù  (intelligence) in the form of scientific reasonings,
mahat-tattva (the cause of the false ego), prakåti (the cause of
the mahat-tattva ), the ten working and knowledge-acquiring
senses, the mind and the five sense objects (such as sound andtouch) are all referred to as the twenty-four elements. Desire,envy, happiness, misery, the body as a combination or resultof the five mahäbhütas (great elements), consciousness as a
state of mind in the form of knowledge, forbearance and de-termination are all functions of the mind, not the soul. There-fore, these characteristics are all part of the kñetra  and are alsoÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !777
indicative of qualities such as determination . In the çruti it is
said that the functions of the mind are desire, determination,doubt, faith, lack of faith, forbearance, detachment, shyness,intellect and fear. These functions exhibit the qualities of kñetra
as described above. Etat kñetraà savikäram.  This kñetra  goes

The constituents of the kñetra are the twenty-four elements
consisting of the five mahäbhütas  (earth, water, fire, air and
sky), the false ego, the mahat-tattva  and its cause ( prakåti ),
the ten external senses (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin, speech,feet, hands, anus and genitals), the one internal sense (themind), and the five objects of the senses (form, taste, smell,touch and sound). This is concluded from the statements ofåñis like Vasiñöha, Devala and Asita, from the Vedic  mantras
and from the Vedänta-sütras.  What the kñetra is and why it
is known as such, can be understood by analysing thesetwenty-four elements. Transformations of kñetra  are desire,
envy, happiness, distress, all the activities of the body whichis the interaction of the five material elements, the variousstates of the mind which are a semblance of the cit function
(cid-äbhäsa ) and forbearance. Therefore, it should be under-
stood that they are a part of kñetra . A chart depicting the
twenty-four elements is given on the next page.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In the above five çlokas , Çré Bhagavän is explaining the
twenty means ( sädhanas ) to attain the goal.The first of these
is humility. He also explains qualities of the kñetra-jïas  the
jévätmä and Paramätmä, who are to be known separately from
the previously mentioned characteristics of kñetra . Eighteen8 - 12! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 780
of these qualities are general and apply to both the jïänés and
the bhaktas . According to the statement of Bhagavän: mayi
cänanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhicäriëé . It is obligatory for devo-
tees to sincerely endeavour in aikäntika-bhakti in order to
experience Him. The seventeen qualities, beginning with hu-
mility, manifest naturally within such devotees who prac-
tise avyabhicäriëé bhakti , chaste devotion. They have no need
to make separate endeavours to acquire these qualities. The
last two qualities, however, are unique to the jïänés . This is
the opinion of the bhakta sampradäya (devotee community).
The meaning of the series of words beginning with
amänitvam  in this çloka  is quite clear. In the småti  çaucam
means internal and external cleanliness. Therein it is said,Cleanliness is of two types, internal and external. Externalcleanliness is achieved by the use of earth, water, etc., andthe cleanliness of consciousness or bhäva  is called cleanli-
ness of the mind, the internal sense. The purport of the wordätma-vinigrahaù  is control of the body. To see the miseries
of birth, death, etc., means to be constantly aware of themas a source of suffering. Asaktiù  means to give up attachment
to son, family etc., and anabhiñvaìgaù  means not becoming
absorbed in the happiness or misery of others.Iñöäniñöopapattiñu  means to remain equipoised upon receiv-
ing material objects deemed favourable or unfavourable.
Mayi  means in Me, in My form as Çyämasundara, and
ananya-yogena  means bhakti which is not mixed with jïäna -
yoga, tapa-yoga , etc. The word ca (also) indicates pradhäné-
bhütä bhakti, which is mixed with jïäna, etc. The bhaktas
only perform the first type of bhakti ananya-bhakti.  Jïänés
adopt the second type of bhakti pradhäné-bhütä bhakti.  This
is the opinion of some bhaktas. Devotees say, Just as ananya-
bhakti  is the means to attain bhagavat-prema , it also helps
to give an experience of Paramätmä. The glories ofÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !781
avyabhicäriëé bhakti  (unswerving bhakti ) have also been de-
scribed in this final set of six chapters so as to explain thissecret.
Jïänés , however, have a different opinion. They say that
ananya-yogena  means to see the self everywhere and
avyabhicäriëé  means to perform that yoga every day. Accord-
ing to Çrépäda Madhusüdana Sarasvaté, the wordavyabhicäriëé  means that which cannot be checked by any-
thing. The word adhyätma-jïäna  refers to the knowledge that
is situated in the self. In order to purify the self, it should bepractised constantly.  T attva -jïänärtha-darçanam  means to
have a vision (aim) of mokña , which is the prayojana  (pur-
pose) of tattva -jïäna,  to deliberate upon it, and to discuss it,
considering it to be ones cherished desire. These twenty arethe general means to attain jïäna  basic knowledge of the
jévätmä  and Paramätmä. Advanced (specific) Paramätmä
jïäna  will be explained later. Symptoms of ignorance
(ajïäna ) such as mänitva  (the desire for honour), are con-
trary to the above symptoms.

norant to be twenty interactions (transformations) of the8 - 12! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 782
kñetra (body). In reality, they comprise knowledge which
destroys the effect of the transformations on the kñetra.  One
attains viçuddha-tattva  (the supremely pure Absolute Truth)
by taking shelter of them. They are not the transformationsof the kñetra;  rather, they are the remedies that can destroy
the transformations of the kñetra . Of these twenty, one should
adopt ananya-avyabhicäriëé bhakti  unto Me. The other nine-
teen characteristics are secondary fruits of bhakti. They pu-
rify the impure kñetra  (body) and ultimatel y, after destroying
the impure kñetra  of the jéva they help him to attain his
eternal, perfect kñetra . These nineteen characteristics, which
are like the throne of Bhakté-devé, should be understood astrue jïäna (vijïäna ). Everything else is ajïäna  ignorance.
Ananya-avyabhicäriëé bhakti  is prominent among all types
of sädhana . The above qualities naturally manifest upon
taking shelter of bhakti . Therefore, pure devotees only ac-
cept ananya-bhakti  which is the svarüpa-lakñaëa  (intrinsic
characteristic) of the jéva. The qualities which are known as
taöastha-lakñaëa  (marginal characteristics) then manifest
concomitantly. This is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(5.18.12):
yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä
sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù
haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëä
manorathenäsati dhävato bahiù
All the devatäs  and their exalted qualities, such as jïäna and their
performance of dharma , always reside in the heart of those who
have niñkäma-bhakti  (selfless devotion) to Çré Bhagavän. On the
other hand, how can one who is not a bhakta  of Bhagavän pos-
sess any of the good qualities of a mahä-puruña ? Such a person is
always hankering for petty worldly sense objects only.
Jïänés  practise good qualities such as saintly behaviour,
non-violence and control of the mind and ego, but they doÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !783
not endeavour for ananya-avyabhicäriëé bhakti  to Çré
Bhagavän. They only perform bhakti  to attain perfection in
jïäna  and mukti . Therefore, it should be understood to be
guëé-bhütä bhakti  (bhakti  predominated by jïäna  and
karma ), not svarüpa -siddhä bhakti  or çuddha-bhakti.
Advaitavädés  (impersonalists) fall into this category.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The jévätmä  and Paramätmä can be known by practising
the various sädhanas  mentioned previously. Of the two,
Paramätmä alone has been indicated by the word sarvagata,
meaning the all-pervading brahma . (Note: the word sarvagata
is from Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkuras original San-skrit commentary.) This brahma  is the worshipable object of
the jïänés  in His nirviçeña  aspect (without attributes), and13! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 784
of the bhaktas  in His saviçeña  aspect (with attributes). Re-
siding within the body, He is known as Paramätmä becauseHe is meditated upon in His four-handed form.
First, brahma  is explained in this çloka  beginning with the
word jïeyam . Anädi  means without a beginning, and since
brahma is My svarüpa, He is eternal. Mat-param  means I
am the supreme ( param ) shelter of brahma . As will be said
later on, brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham,  I am the foundation or
basis of brahma.  But what is that brahma ? Expecting this
question, Çré Bhagavän says that brahma  is neither asat nor
sat. In other words, He is beyond both cause and effect.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Previously, Çré Bhagavän explained jïäna-sädhana (the
means of attaining jïäna ). Now, in the present çloka,  He
is explaining the knowable para-tattva , which is the sädhya
(goal) of that jïäna.  The jïänés  think that the para-tattva
is nirviçeña-brahma . They imagine this para-tattva  to be be-
reft of name, form, qualities, activities, associates and soforth, a void that cannot be described by any adjectives suchas energetic, variegated or active. Çuddha-bhaktas  who take
shelter of ananya-avyabhicäriëé bhakti  see parabrahma
para-tattva , the Supreme Absolute Reality, as Çré Kåñëa, the
embodiment of cid-viläsa  (transcendental sports), the ba-
sis of all apräkåta  qualities, energies and mellows, and who
is devoid of petty material qualities. Although some placesin çruti describe this tattva  as nirviçeña,  these statements only
deny the material features of Çré Bhagavän, not the tran-scendental qualities. The çästras  themselves have illumi-
nated this deep secret:
yä yä çrutir jalpati nirviçeñaà / sä säbhidhatte sa-viçeñam eva
vicära-yoge sati hanta täsäà / präyo baléyaù sa-viçeñam eva
Hayaçérña-païcarätraÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !785
Those very same Vedic  mantras  that first describe that tattva  as
nirviçeña  (without qualities) alternatively establish it as saviçeña
(with qualities). Both nirviçeña  and saviçeña  are indeed eternal
aspects of Bhagavän, but deep deliberation reveals saviçeña-tattva
to be superior. This is because one experiences only saviçeña-
tattva  in the material world, whereas there is no experience of
nirviçeña-tattva .
The only knowable object of the nirviçeña-jïänés  is indi-
cated in the present çloka  by the word mat-param , meaning
sheltered in Me.
brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham / amåtasyävyayasya ca
çäçvatasya ca dharmasya / sukhasyaikäntikasya ca
For I am the shelter of nirviçeña-brahma  and the sole refuge of
everlasting immortality, eternal dharma  and transcendental bliss
in the form of prema  related with aikäntika-bhakti . (Gétä 14.27)
This subject will be described in detail in the commentary
on the above çloka . Sometimes in çästra,  the jéva is also called
brahma , but the jéva can never be called parabrahma because
he is different from brahma  in every respect. The jéva has
atomic consciousness and parabrahma is the infinite con-
scious entity.
The jéva is sometimes also called brahma  because of his
partial qualitative similarity of being conscious. Some people
suffer from the misconception that the jéva becomes brahma
because they do not understand the deep import of the Gétäs
use of words describing the jéva such as brahma-bhüta  (Gétä
18.54) and brahma-bhüyäya kalpate  (Gétä  14.26). This sub-
ject will be described in detail in the çloka : brahma-bhütaù
prasannätmä  (Gétä  18.54).
Both the jévätmä and Paramätmä are jïeyam (knowable),
yet one can only attain the understanding that jéva-tattva
is dependent on Paramätmä by continuous cultivation of13! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 786
devotional service unto Paramätmä. The jéva is without be-
ginning and, by constitution, devoted to Bhagavän. He is only
partly endowed with the qualities of brahma  and he is be-
yond  sat and asat (cause and effect).
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, I have explained the tattva  of kñetra-jïa  to you. I have
explained the nature of kñetra (the body), its transformations,
and the process by which one can become free from these
transformations. I have also explained that the jévätmä  and

Will it not contradict the statements of çruti such as,
sarvaà khalv idaà brahma All this is brahma  (Chändogya
Upaniñad  3.14.1) and brahmaivedaà sarvam Everything is
brahma  to say that brahma  is distinct from both cause and
effect? Anticipating such a question, Çré Bhagavän is explain-ing that, although by nature brahma  is beyond both cause
and effect, brahma  is both the cause and the effect because
the energy and the energetic are non-different. Therefore,He is saying that His hands and feet, etc., are everywhere.This means that brahma  has unlimited hands and feet in the
form of the hands and feet of every visible entity, extendingfrom Lord Brahmä down to a minute ant. Similarly, His eyes,heads, mouths and ears are also everywhere.

In the previous çloka  brahma  was described as being be-
yond sat and asat (cause and effect). Now the  Vedänta-sütra ,
çakti-çaktimator abhedaù,  The energy and the energetic are
non-different, can be quoted in response to one who ques-
tions the validity of such çruti statements as, sarvaà khalv
idaà brahma  and brahmaivedaà sarvam . According to this
sütra , although the svarüpa  of Çré Bhagavän is beyond both
cause and effect, the workings of çakti  are indeed the work
of çaktimän  because çakti  (energy) and çaktimän  (the ener-
getic) are non-different. One can thus, understand that all
effects such as this visible world are the svarüpa  of Bhagavän
(non-different from Him), being transformations of çakti .
The present çloka  is being spoken to make this point clear.
Brahma alone exists, pervading everything through the me-
dium of the hands, feet etc., of all jévas who are subject to
Him and situated within Him. Since He is all-pervading Hehas unlimited hands, eyes, feet and ears. However, the jévätmä14! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 788
is neither all-pervading, nor can he have unlimited hands,
heads, feet, etc. Paramätmä is omnipotent, but the jéva is not.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Just
as the suns rays illuminate due to their dependence on the
sun, in the same way, brahma-tattva has attained its infinite
and all-pervading aspect by depending upon My potency. The
existence of brahma , who is the foundation for unlimited jévas
beginning from Brahmä down to the ant, collectively encom-
passes unlimited hands, feet, eyes, heads, mouths, ears, etc.,
and is visible everywhere as His cosmic manifestation.

says: apäëi-pädo javano grahétä. Although He does not have
material senses, such as hands and feet, He accepts, movesand sees ( Svetäçvatara Upanisad 3.19).
Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (6.8) also states: paräsya çaktir
vividhaiva çrüyate sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca.  It is
heard that brahma  has various types of transcendental
energies ( parä çakti ). The çaktis : jïäna (knowledge), bala
(strength) and kriya (action), are naturally inherent in Him.
That famous form of His as described in the çruti  is the
source of all energy.
He is devoid of attachment to the mundane plane and He
maintains everyone in His expansion as Çré Viñëu. He isnirguëa , that is, He has a transcendental form which is free
from the guëas  (such as sattva ), and He is guëa-bhoktå  be-

though He is devoid of material senses, He has transcenden-tal senses. Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.9) also states:

Although Bhagavän does not have material hands, feet, etc., He
accepts and walks. Even without material eyes and ears, He sees

sarvaà khalv idaà brahma , All this is brahma,  He has a
personal form different from all others. Only He is equal toHimself. He is asamorddhva , meaning there is nobody who
is equal to Him, what to speak of greater than Him. How-
ever, not everyone can know Him because He is very subtle.
Only His ananya-bhaktas  can know Him by the influence
of ananya-bhakti . Therefore, He is very far away as well as

He is even the light that emanates from luminaries such

beautifully radiant before Him, what to speak of fire. Ap-

self-effulgent brahma  alone that all luminous objects such as the
sun give light. In fact, the whole universe exists only because ofHis existence.
Therefore, He is beyond darkness. It can never touch Him.
Çruti  also says, His complexion is like the colour of the sun
and is beyond darkness. His full manifestation in the fac-
ulty of pure intelligence is called jïäna . He Himself has be-
come modified as form, etc., and is jïeya  (the knowable) and

Here, in the çloka  beginning with the word iti Çré Bhagavän
is concluding His statements about knowledge of kñetra,  etc.,
with an explanation about who is qualified for this knowl-edge and its result. In this chapter, the word kñetra  has been
explained from the çloka : mahä-bhütäny ahaìkäro (Gétä  13.6),
to adhyätma in Gétä 13.12. Jïäna  has also been described from
Gétä 13.8, up to adhyätma in Gétä 13.12. Jïeyaù  and jïäna-
gamyam  have been described from the çloka  beginning with
jneyaà  in Gétä  13.13, up to the çloka beginning with jyotiñäm
in Gétä 13.18. That very same Absolute Reality is known as
brahma , Paramätmä and Bhagavän. This has been briefly
described.
Mad-bhäväya  means he attains säyujya-mukti.  The word
mad-bhakta  refers to a jïäné  who is endowed with bhakti .
Or mad-bhakta  means My unalloyed servant ( aikäntika-ÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !797

qualified to attain My prema.  In other words, he becomes
qualified to perform prema-bhakti .

In this çloka,  Çré Bhagavän clearly states that karmés ,
jïänés , yogés , tapasvés  and nirviçeña-mäyävädés  cannot under-
stand the real essence ( tattva ) of Bhagavad-gétä . Only bhaktas
of Bhagavän can understand it. This is the deep meaning ofthe word mad-bhakta . One should first become a bhakta  to
understand the tattva  of jïeya  (the knowable), jïätä  (the
knower) and jïäna  (knowledge), as described in the Gétä. For
this reason, one must practise bhakti  (anuçélana ) by taking
shelter of the lotus feet of a sad-guru .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, I have briefly described these three tattvas : kñetra ,
jïäna  and jïeya . Vijïäna  is the jïäna  of all three tattvas
combined. Bhaktas  who achieve this jïäna  attain My unal-
loyed prema-bhakti . Those non-devotees who merely accept
the shelter of useless monistic sampradäyas  become bereft of
real knowledge. Jïäna  is nothing but the sitting place of
Bhakti-devé. It is merely sattva-çuddhi , purification of the
jévätmäs existence which is sheltered by bhakti . This topic
will be further clarified in Chapter Fifteen, whereinpuruñottama-tattva  is described.

ing the jévätmä  (the puruña ), who is also kñetra-jïa . Why
did the relationship between this kñetra-jïa  and mäyä
(prakåti ) occur, and when did it start?
Expecting this question, Çré Bhagavän answers with this
çloka beginning with prakåti.  Prakåti  (mäyä material nature)
and puruña  (the jéva) are both without beginning. That is,
their cause has no beginning. Because they are the energy ofMe, Éçvara, who am without beginning, they are also with-

This material nature is divided into eight parts: earth, water, fire,
air, ether, mind, intellect and ego, but it is inferior to anothernature of Mine. The jévas are My superior energy. They accept this
material world to enjoy the results of their actions ( karma ).
According to this statement of Mine, because both mäyä

therefore their relationship also is without beginning. But,
although they are related to each other, they are in fact dif-ferent. Çré Bhagavän therefore says: vikäräàç ca The body
and the senses, and guëäàç caiva the transformations of
guëas  such as happiness, distress, lamentation and illusion,
are born from prakåti  (prakåti-sambhütän ). The jéva who is

such as lust, anger, affection and fear, and how the relation-ship between the kñetra-jïa-jéva  and mäyä  has occurred. Both
prakåti  (mäyä ) and the jéva are without beginning, being the

Kåñëa. Kåñëas taöastha-çakti  (marginal potency) transforms into
unlimited jévas. Since çakti (energy) and çaktimän  (the energetic)
are non-different, atomic conscious jévas which are transforma-
tions of çakti,  are in some respects non-different from Kåñëa. But
they are also eternally different in various ways. Bhagavän is
unlimitedly conscious, and the jéva is atomically conscious. Both
are non-different from the perspective of consciousness, but
Bhagavän is the complete conscious entity ( pürëa cid-vastu ) and
the jéva is an atomic conscious entity ( aëucid-vastu ). Bhagavän
is the master of mäyä , and the jéva is subject to mäyä . Bhagavän
is the cause of creation, sustenance and destruction, but the jéva
is not. The example is given that just as unlimited atoms are
visible in the rays coming from the sun, the rays of Kåñëas en-
ergy produce unlimited atoms in the form of the jévas. Similarly,
just as unlimited minute sparks come out of a fire, so unlimited
atomic conscious jévas are emanating from Bhagavän.
These are partial examples to explain the relationship be-
tween sac-cid-änanda  Bhagavän and the atomic conscious
jéva. This means that their purpose is to make this reality
understood by the principle of çäkhä-candra-nyäya , showing
the moon by first pointing towards the branch of a tree over
which the moon is visible. In this material world, no example
can fully describe parabrahma , but these examples give a
partial understanding.
Kåñëa is the ultimate limit of para-tattva . His inherent parä
çakti  (transcendental potency) is also known as antaraìga-
çakti, or cit-çakti . This cit-çakti  is Kåñëas  svabhäviké  (natu-
rally inherent) svarüpa-çakti  and the actions of that çakti,
manifest in three ways. When it manifests the consciouscreation ( cit-jagat ), it is called cit-çakti (spiritual creative
potency). When it manifests unlimited jévas,  it is called jéva-
çakti and when it manifests the material universe, it is calledÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !801
mäyä -çakti . By the will of Bhagavän, the jévas manifest from
the jéva-çakti (marginal potency); thus, their constitutional
nature is to be eternal servants of Kåñëa. However, they cancome under the influence of mäyä  because they are atomic
by nature. The jévas situated in this illusory world have mis-
used their free will. Thus, they have forgotten their ownsvarüpa  and Kåñëas svarüpa , due to their association with
mäyä  since time immemorial. Having become trapped in the
cycle of birth and death, they are suffering the various typesof three-fold miseries. When the jévas who have become bound
in this material world attain sädhu-saìga  by some great for-
tune, they can realise their own constitutional nature. Follow-ing the process of bhakti, they engage in the service of Bhagavän,
by which they become situated in their own svarüpa . This
conclusion is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.37):
bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd
éçäd apetasya viparyayo småtiù
tan-mäyayäto budha äbhajet taà
bhaktyaikayeçaà guru-devatätmä
The jéva is the eternal servant of Bhagavän, but by turning his
face away from Bhagavän, he has forgotten his own svarüpa .
Therefore, his eternal svarüpa  (occupation), service to Kåñëa,
has become covered. By associating with mäyä,  he identifies
himself with the body and, subsequently, always fears for the
material body, house, etc. He undergoes various types of miser-
ies, being bewildered by Kåñëas mäyä . By some good fortune an
intelligent person who takes shelter of ananya-bhakti  and per-
forms bhajana  to Kåñëa under the guidance of a sad-guru  is able
to cross over mäyä .
Furthermore it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.7.9):
seyaà bhagavato mäyä / yan nayena virudhyate
éçvarasya vimuktasya / kärpaëyam uta bandhanam20! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 802
Some conditioned souls maintain that Çré Bhagavän is overcome
by illusion and at the same time they proclaim Him to be uncon-
ditioned. This opposes all logic.
Bhagaväns yogamäyä is a special type of çakti  that can
make the possible impossible, and the impossible possible. This
çakti of Bhagavän makes it possible for the jéva to attain lib-
eration from the bondage of the material world, once he has
attained the mercy of the ever-liberated ( vimukta ) Éçvara. It
also makes the jévas bondage to this world possible. This fact
cannot be understood merely on the strength of logic. Nor
can the influence of Bhagaväns acintya-çakti  be understood
merely by argument. This acintya-çakti  of Bhagavän makes
the jéva become deluded by mäyä, and he cannot realise
Bhagaväns mercy.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, I am
explaining the result of knowledge of kñetra  and kñetra-jïa .
Three tattvas  manifest in the existence of the jéva bound by
matter:  prakåti , puruña  and Paramätmä. The kñetra  is known
as prakåti , the jéva as puruña,  and My all-pervading manifes-
tation in both of them as Paramätmä. Prakåti  and puruña  are
both without beginning. They exist even before cosmic time
(jaòéya-käla ). In material time, neither of them take birth.
Rather, they have become manifest in spiritual time
(cinmaya-käla ) by My çakti  and they co-exist in My supreme
existence. Jaòa-prakåti  (material nature) merges into Me and
again becomes manifest during creation under the cover ofmundane time ( jaòéya-käla ). The jéva is a tattva  who ema-
nates from My eternal taöastha-çakti . He has been enveloped
by My jaòa-prakåti  material potency, because he has become
averse to Me. In fact, the jéva is pure, conscious tattva,  but
because his quality is marginal, he has acquired a usefulness
for jaòa-prakåti . This took place by the arrangement of My
transcendental energy . That is, he tends to become affectedÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !803
by material nature. How the conscious jéva became entangled
in inert matter cannot be ascertained by human (condi-tioned) logic and knowledge because My acintya-çakti  is not
under the influence of your limited human intellect. It is
important for you to know this much only: all of the per-verted transformations and material modes of the baddha-
jéva are born from material nature and are not a part of his
sva-dharma  (eternal constitution).

Prakåti  is said to be the source of the workings of

material happiness, distress, and so forth.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Now Çré Bhagavän is revealing the jévas  relationship with
mäyä . Kärya  (effect) refers to the body, käraëa  (cause) re-
fers to the senses, which are the means of happiness andmisery, and karttåtva  (agent), refers to the presiding deities
of the senses, the devatäs . Due to ignorance, the puruña
(baddha-jéva ) imposes upon himself the feeling that he is
the doer or agent, but in fact, prakåti  is the cause of such a21! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 804
feeling in him. It is prakåti  alone which transforms into ef-
fect in contact with the puruña . The tendency of mäyä
(avidyä or ignorance) is to give illusory knowledge to the jéva.
However, only the puruña  (jéva) is the cause of the experi-
ences of happiness and misery produced by mäyä . Although
kärya (effect), käraëa (cause), karttåtva (agency), and
bhoktåtva (enjoyment) are the characteristics of prakåti (ma-
terial nature), prakåti predominates over the first three be-
cause she herself is predominated by inertness ( jaòa). And
due to his conscious nature, puruña  (the jéva) predominates
over bhokåtva (the experience of happiness and distress).
Something (an entity or activity) is designated or named ac-cording to its predominant aspects. According to this logic,prakåti  is said to be the cause of kärya (the body), käraëa
(the senses) and karttåtva (the devatäs ). Puruña  (the jéva) is
said to be the cause of bhoktåtva .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Prakåti  is the source of mundane kärya  (effect, the body),
käraëa  (cause, the senses), and karttåtva  (working agency, the
presiding deities of the senses), while the baddha-jéva is said
to be the cause of bhoktåtva the experience of mundane
happiness and misery. Here one should clearly understandthat the çuddha-jéva  (the jéva in his pure state) is not the
enjoyer of material happiness, nor does he experience distress.
However, because the jéva is born from the taöastha-çakti , when
he identifies himself with the body, which is generated bycontact with mäyä , an ego develops whereby he experiences
material happiness and distress.
In this regard, Lord Kapiladeva says in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(3.26.8):
kärya-käraëa-karttåtve / käraëaà prakåtià viduù
bhoktåtve sukha-duùkhänäà / puruñaà prakåteù paramÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !805
O Mother! Those who are tattva-vit  accept prakåti  (material
nature) to be the cause of kärya  (the body), käraëa  (the senses)
and karttåtva  (the presiding deities of the senses, the devatäs ).
Through his pure ego, the küöa-stha  ätmä  (the soul in his
constitutional position) is related to Paramätmä as His eter-nal servant, and therefore Paramätmä dominates the jévas
existence. Thus, the küöa-stha  ätmä is above all material
designations and unchanged by the effects of prakåti . Prakåti
predominates because the baddha-jéva strongly identifies
himself with the body, which is born from the transforma-tion of prakåti . Therefore, paëòitas say that prakåti  is the cause
of karttåtva  (the agency, the presiding deities of the senses),
but in terms of experiencing the results of karma  such as
happiness and distress, the puruña  (taöastha-çakti ), who is
different from prakåti , is said to be the cause. Although both
karttåtva  and bhoktåtva  are under one ego (of the baddha-jéva ),
prakåti is the dominant factor in them because the body and
so forth are the effect of inert matter. The experience ofhappiness and distress is not possible without consciousness;therefore, puruña (the baddha-jéva ), who is under the con-
trol of prakåti  is the dominant factor here. However, it should
also be understood that the karttåtva (agency) of both prakåti
and puruña  (the jéva) is under the control of the karttåtva  of
Éçvara. Both mäyä  as well as the jéva are under Éçvaras con-
trol.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The jéva considers the qualities of prakåti  such as karttåtva
(the presiding deities of the senses) and bhoktåtva  (the expe-
rience of happiness and distress) to be his own because offalse knowledge born of ignorance since time immemorial.This is the reason for his bondage to the material world. Thejéva is situated within the body, which is the effect of prakåti,
and he is fully absorbed in identifying the body as his ownself. Due to his false ego, he considers aspects of the mindsuch as lamentation, delusion and misery, which are prakåti-
jän (generated by the modes of prakåti ), to be his own and
suffers because of them. This is all because of guëa-saìga ,
association with the modes of material nature. This meansthat his identification with the body, which is made of theguëas , is an assumption based on ignorance because the jéva
is in fact, free from this association. Where does he enjoy?
Expecting this question, Çré Bhagavän says , satéñu  (sat-asad ).
In the species who have higher consciousness such as sädhus
and devatäs  and, asatéñu in the species whose conscious-
ness is lower such as animals and birds. He takes birth and
experiences happiness and distress according to his good and
bad karma.ÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !807
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Having turned their faces away from Kåñëa, the jévas, who
are of a marginal nature, consider the body to be the self.
They accept the ego of being the doers and the enjoyers of
inert ( jaòa) matter. Thus, they become bound to the mate-
rial world and take birth in various species of life, thereby
experiencing happiness and distress. Such jévas  who are de-
luded by mäyä  have fallen into the cycle of birth and death.
Consequently, they suffer worldly miseries, sometimes tak-
ing birth in Svarga, sometimes in Naraka (hell), sometimes
as kings and sometimes as subjects, sometimes as brähmaëas
and sometimes as çüdras,  and sometimes as worms, asuras ,
servants or masters. Sometimes they are happy, and some-
times distressed. The consciousness of the jéva is atomic and
although he is a servant of Bhagavän, he becomes overpow-
ered by mäyä  who is close by. This is because he harbours
sensual material desires, which are the result of his aversion
to Kåñëa. Just as the intelligence of a person who is possessed
by a hobgoblin or ghost becomes covered, similarly, the in-
telligence of the jévas overpowered by mäyä  becomes covered.
By the mercy of Bhagavän and His bhaktas,  he attains sat-
saìga  and becomes free from mäyä. Becoming situated in his
own svarüpa,  he enjoys the bliss of sevä to Çré Bhagavän.

Caitanya-caritämåta Madhya-lélä  (20.117-118)
Because he has forgotten Çré Kåñëa, the jéva has been absorbed
in his attempts to enjoy the material energy since time imme-morial. Therefore, Kåñëas mäyä-çakti awards the jéva the vari-
ous sufferings of saàsära . Sometimes he is elevated to Svarga-22! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 808

just like a man who is punished by the king by being tied to awooden plank and dunked in a river. Sometimes he is immersedtill he nearly drowns, and sometimes he is released for a fewmoments of apparent happiness.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
After explaining the jévätmä , Çré Bhagavän is now explain-
ing Paramätmä in this çloka  beginning with upadrañöä . From
the çloka,  anädi mat-paraà brahma  (Gétä  13.13) to, hådi
sarvasya viñöhitam  (Gétä 13.18), Paramätmä was explained in
both a general and specific manner. One fact in particularshould be understood: although Paramätmä remains close tothe jévätmä , He is still separate from him. To clarify this, it is
being stated that Paramätmä is situated within this body. Para
refers to another puruña  (enjoyer) within this body. That
puruña  is Maheçvara (the Supreme Proprietor), or Paramätmä.ÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !809
The very word Paramätmä is evidence that He is superior to
the ätmä . In terms of absolute reality the word param  refers
to sväàça  (a personal expansion of Kåñëa). Just to emphasise
this, it is said that He is situated separately from the jéva, yet
is very close ( upa) to him and He is the seer (witness).
Anumantä  (the permitter) means that while residing close to
the jéva, He is anugrähaka , kind and facilitating. It is said in
Gopäla-täpané  Upaniñad (Uttara  97): säkñé cetäù kevalo
nirguëaç ca. Puruña  is säkñé  (the witness), cetäù  (conscious),
kevalä  (exclusive) and nirguëa  (beyond the modes). Similarly,
bhartä  means supporter and bhoktä  means protector.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Paramätmä, who is situated as the witness in this body, is
different from the jéva. The advaita-vädés  (monists) consider
the jévätmä  and Paramätmä to be one, but it is clear from
this çloka  that within each body, Paramätmä, who is the
witness and permitter, is different from the jévätmä . Because
He is superior to the jévätmä , He is called Paramätmä, or the
superior ätmä . This Paramätmä is an aàça  of an aàça (por-
tion of a portion) of Svayaà Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa. WithoutHis permission, the jévätmä  can do nothing. There are un-
limited jévätmäs , and Paramätmä is eternally existing within
each of them as their friend and supreme well-wisher. Al-though He lives with the jéva Paramätmä is always the master
of both the jéva and mäyä .
Bhagavän has bestowed an invaluable treasure upon the
jéva in the form of independence. By properly utilizing this
independence, he can very easily relish the nectar of prema-
mayé sevä  to Bhagavän in His eternal dhäma . But by misus-
ing this independence, he becomes bound by mäyä  and, while
suffering from the three-fold miseries, he is trapped in the
cycle of birth and death. Therefore, how can a jéva who is
overpowered by mäyä  ever be Bhagavän, the master of mäyä ?23! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 810
Such a conception is illusory and opposed to the conclusions
of çästra .
Paramätmä is very clearly described in çruti as different from
the jévätmä : nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm  (Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  6.13). He is the supreme eternal among all eternals,
that is, He is the topmost eternal being and among all con-scious beings He is the bestower of consciousness, the originalconsciousness. Moreover, it is said in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad
(4.6) and the Muëòaka Upaniñad  (3.1.1):
dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyä / samänaà våkñaà pariñasvajäte
tayor anyaù pippalaà svädv atty / anaçnann anyo bhicäkaçéti
Kñérodakaçäyé-puruña  and the jéva live together in this tempo-
rary material world (the body) just like two friends in a pippala
tree. One, the jéva, is tasting the fruits of the tree according to
his karma,  and the other, Paramätmä, is the witness. He is not
enjoying the fruits, but watching His friend.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.11.6) also states:
suparëäv etau sadåçau sakhäyau
yadåcchayaitau kåta-néòau ca våkñe
ekas tayoù khädati pippalännam
anyo niranno pi balena bhüyän
Two birds in the form of the jéva and Éçvara have a relationship,
being equal in quality, that is consciousness. They are living in
the nest (heart) of the tree (the body) by the will of providence.
One bird (the jéva) is enjoying the fruits ( karma ) of that tree
(the body). The other bird, Éçvara, is not enjoying the fruits and
is ever satisfied in eternal bliss, being happily situated by thestrength of His çaktis such as jïäna .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, The
jéva is My constant companion. He becomes close to Me when
he becomes situated purely in his marginal nature. ThisÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !811
marginal nature is his independence. The perfection of jaiva-
dharma , the eternal occupation of the jéva is to achieve pure
love for Me by using his marginal (independent) nature.When the jéva misuses that independent nature, he enters
the material field. Even then, I become his companion asParamätmä. Therefore, I alone am the witness, the permit-ter, the supporter and protector, and Maheçvara, the SupremeController of all the jévas actions. Thus, by the name of
Paramätmä, I am always present in the body as parama-
puruña . I award the result of whatever karma  is performed
by the jéva in his conditioned state.

Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka  beginning with the word

The sädhaka  becomes qualified to achieve mukti  when he
knows bhakti-tattva , jéva-tattva , paramätma-tattva and their
mutual relationships. Then, by the mercy of a sad-guru  and
the Vaiñëavas, and by following the path of çuddha-bhakti ,
he gradually attains the stages of çraddhä , niñöhä , ruci, äsakti ,
bhäva and finally bhagavat-prema , entering the abode of
Bhagavän. It is certain that he never fell from bhagavat-
dhäma  and never will. The imaginary conception that the
baddha-jévas  were first engaged in the service of Bhagavän
in His dhäma  and somehow or other fell into the material
world is completely against the conclusion of all çästra . But
if this theory is accepted for the sake of argument, the ques-
tion arises as to the significance (glory) of bhakti  and prema
if one again falls into the material world, after performingrigorous sadhana to attain Çré Bhagaväns  dhäma.  The ex-
amples of King Citraketu and Jaya and Vijaya are not ap-
propriate in this regard because they are bhagavat-parikaras
(eternal associates of Bhagavän). They descended into this
material world by the will of Bhagavän for the welfare of
the jévas and for the nourishment of Çré Bhagaväns lélä. It
is a grievous offense to consider them to be ordinary condi-
tioned souls. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains
this in Mädhurya-kädambiné . The jéva who attains bhagavad-
dhäma  never becomes bound in this material world, and if
he ever does come here, it is as an associate of Bhagavän and
by His will. He is not subject to material conditions. Gétä
(15:6) states:

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän is explaining the various means to attain
ätma-jïäna  knowledge of the self in this çloka  beginning
with the word dhyänena  and in the next çloka . By dhyäna
meditation on Bhagavän, some bhaktas  see Him within their
hearts. Gétä (18.55) bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti, will explain this .
But I am not visible to any other types of worshippers. The
jïänés  endeavour to see Me by säìkhya  (the analytical study
of conscious and inert matter), the yogés  by añöäìga-yoga, and
karma-yogés  try to see Me by niñkäma-karma-yoga . Here,
säìkhya-yoga , añöäìga-yoga and niñkäma-karma-yoga  are not
the direct causes of receiving darçana  of Paramätmä. This is25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 814
because they are all sättvic  and Paramätmä is guëätéta be-
yond the modes. It is also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.19.1)
jïänaà ca mayi sannyaset. One should surrender that jïäna
to Me. Moreover, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  states (11.14.21)
bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù. I am attained only by aikäntika-
bhakti . It is clear from the above statements of Bhagavän
that He is attained only by bhakti  which is devoid of jïäna .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In this çloka,  Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa further explains how
one can attain viçuddha-ätma-jïäna  (pure knowledge of the
self), which was described in the previous çloka . Although
çästra mentions various processes such as säìkhya -yoga ,
añöäìga-yoga  and niñkäma-karma-yoga , one can attain this
viçuddha-jïäna  in a simple and natural way only by bhakti-
yoga . In the dialogue between Çré Kåñëa and Uddhava in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.14.21), Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa Himself
says: bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù. I can be attained only by
kevala-bhakti.  Furthermore, He says in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.6-8):
yogäs trayo mayä proktä / nåëäà çreyo-vidhitsayä

For the welfare of human beings, I have described three types of
yoga: karma-yoga , jïäna -yoga and bhakti-yoga . There is no other
way to achieve Me. Those who are completely detached from
the material world become eligible for jïäna -yoga, but those who
are neither too detached from worldliness nor too attached to
it, and who, by the will of providence, have faith in hearing aboutÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !815
My léläs  are qualified to engage in bhakti.  By following the path
of bhakti  they attain perfection very quickly.
Bhakti-yoga  is the best of these three types of yoga. In fact,
I am only fully attained by bhakti.  This is a very deep secret.
Na sädhayati mäà yogo  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.14.20). I am
not controlled by säìkhya etc. In other words, I do not be-
come pleased by the processes of karma -yoga , jïäna-yoga ,
japa, tapa, yajïa , self-study and so forth. I am conquered only
by bhakti .
This is also said in Gétä  (6.47):
yogénäm api sarveñäà / mad-gatenäntar-ätmanä
çraddhävän bhajate yo mäà / sa me yuktatamo mataù
He who constantly performs My bhajana  with full faith, always
thinking exclusively of Me within himself, is, in My opinion,
the topmost of all yogés .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Arjuna, with respect to the topmost goal ( paramärtha ), the
baddha-jévas  are divided into two divisions: bahir-mukha
(those averse to spiritual life) and antar-mukha (those in-
clined to spiritual life). Atheists, agnostics (those who are
attached to inert matter), skeptics and moralists are counted
among the paramärtha-bahir-mukha  (those averse to the
supreme transcendental goal). An inquisitive and faithful
person, a karma-yogé  and a bhakta  are antar-mukha . Bhaktas
are superior because they take shelter of cit which is beyond
prakåti,  and meditate on Paramätmä within the self ( ätma-
tattva ). The säìkhya-yogés  who search after Éçvara (the Con-
troller) are the next best. After deliberating on prakåti , which
consists of twenty-four elements, they come to know that
the twenty-fifth element, the jéva is a pure conscious entity.
They gradually engage in bhakti-yoga  to the twenty-sixth25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 816

By the process of niñkäma-karma-yoga , they attain the fa-
cility to deliberate on and worship Bhagavän.

The word anye  means those who hear the kathä  (topics)

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In this çloka,  Çré Bhagavän is explaining a very important
process. There are some people who are not atheists, nor are
they skeptical, or mäyävädés , or philosophers. Although they
are only ordinary people in society, they are quite faithful
because they have good past life impressions ( saàskäras ).
When they hear bhagavat-kathä  in sat-saìga  and receiveÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !817
instructions from various preachers, they try to worship Me
somehow or other. Later, when they have attained the asso-ciation of çuddha-bhaktas , they receive the opportunity to
hear pure hari-kathä,  and by entering bhakti-tattva,  they ul-
timately achieve Me.
No education about ätma-jïäna  is given in current so-
called cultured society, but Bhagavad-Gétä  and Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  explain that the process of hearing about ätma-
jïäna is very powerful. Specifically, in recent times, Çré
Caitanya Mahäprabhu placed great emphasis on hearingand chanting hari-näma : Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa
Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma,Hare Hare. His prime instruction is that by the influenceof hearing, chanting and remembering çré-hari-näma and
bhagavat-kathä , one can very easily attain service to
Bhagavän. Four-headed Brahmä, Çré Närada Gosvämé, ÇréVedavyäsa, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé, King Parékñit and
Prahläda Mahäräja all attained direct darçana  of Bhagavän
by following this process.
Çréla Haridäsa Öhäkura was one of the associates of Çré
Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Although he was born in a Yavanafamily, he used to chant three läkhs  (300,000) of Çré Haris
names every day. All types of people, both rich and poor,had great regard for him. Seeing this, Rämacandra Khan,the famous landlord of that area, became envious of him.To defame Haridäsa, he lured a beautiful young prostituteby promising her great wealth, and one moonlit night hesent her to Haridäsa Öhäkura. Sitting in a solitary placeon the bank of Bhagavaté Gaìgä, Haridäsa Öhäkura, whilekeeping count of his rounds, loudly and attentively chantedthe Hare Kåñëa mahä mantra : Hare Kåñëa Hare Kåñëa,
Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare / Hare Räma, Hare Räma, RämaRäma, Hare Hare. The Tulasé plant stood on a nearby26! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 818
platform. The prostitute approached him and expressed her
mind by her various bodily postures, but this had no in-fluence on Haridäsa Öhäkura. Finally, she openly propo-sitioned him. He replied, I have taken a vow to chant tenmillion names of Hari. I will fulfil all your desires withina very short period, when I have completed this number.Hearing this assurance, the prostitute sat nearby for theentire night, waiting for him to complete his chanting. Inthe morning, she went back to her house out of fear ofbeing seen by other people. The next night, she again cameand sat near Haridäsa Öhäkura. He again told her thathe was just about to complete his chanting. That nightpassed like the previous one. When she arrived on the thirdnight, Haridäsa Öhäkura again started chanting loudly.Aho! The effect of hearing hari-näma  from the mouth of
a çuddha-bhakta  was so wonderful that it changed the
heart of that prostitute. She fell at his feet crying and asked
to be forgiven. Haridäsa Öhäkura was very pleased and
said, I would have gone to another place the very firstday you came, but I remained here only for your sake. Thatyour heart has changed is a matter of great pleasure to me.This is the unfailing glory of hearing and chanting hari-
näma . Now you should fearlessly remain in this äçrama
and continuously chant the name of Hari. You shouldrender service to Tulasé devé and Bhagavaté Gaìgä. Shefollowed these instructions and her life changed com-pletely. Even great bhaktas started coming to her äçrama
to have darçana  of a parama-vaiñëavé . Remaining humble,
lowly and without possessions, she performed bhajana  of
Hari, and went to the abode of Bhagavän within a veryshort time. In this way, even an ordinary person can at-tain Bhagavän by hearing and chanting.ÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !819

To explain how Paramätmä is situated in all perishable

the word samam.  Know that Paramätmä is dwelling within
all perishable bodies. Those who see in this way are realjïänés .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Those who are jïänés  in the real sense simultaneously ex-
perience the body, the embodied soul (the ätmä ) and the
friend of the ätmä Paramätmä, by the influence of the as-
sociation of a tattva-darçé  (self-realised) mahätmä . On the
contrary, those who are bereft of such saintly association aretruly ignorant. They can only see the perishable body andconsider it to be their self. When the body is destroyed, theythink that everything is lost. A jïäné,  however, experiences
the existence of the ätmä  and Paramätmä even after the body
is destroyed. When one body is destroyed, the ätmä  enters
another body along with the senses and subtle body. Hisfriend, Paramätmä, also remains situated with the jévätmä
as the witness. Those who actually understand this are, in-deed, jïänés .

The baddha-jéva  is bound by various modes and actions of
material nature, and for this reason he is put into varioussituations. But although Parameçvara is situated in the heartsof different jévas, He exists everywhere equally. Those who
understand this finally achieve the supreme destination. Onthe contrary, those whose minds do not meditate on theopulences, qualities and glories of Bhagavän remain absorbedin sense gratification. Being the killer of their own ätmä  (self),
they fall down. This is also described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.17) wherein Kåñëa says:

O Uddhava, this human body is the basis of the attainment of
all auspicious results, and although it is very rare, it has been
obtained easily. It is like a strong boat in which to cross the ocean29! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 822
of material existence. Simply by accepting the shelter of the guru ,
who becomes the captain and navigator of this boat, and blown
by the favourable winds of remembrance of Me, it is propelled
towards its destination. After acquiring this human body, a per-
son who does not endeavour to cross this ocean of material ex-
istence, even after getting so much facility, is certainly consid-ered the killer of his own ätmä .

Prakåtyaiva  means that prakåti , transformed into the body
and senses, performs all work. The vision of those jévas who
think that they are the doers, because they identify the self

one who sees that he is not the doer of action sees properly.

The baddha-jéva  is impelled by the actions and modes of
prakåti  because of the false ego which makes him think thatÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !823
he is the doer of material actions. But in the true sense, he is
not the doer. Bhagavän has explained this earlier.
Parameçvara is also not the doer although He is situated in
the hearts of all beings as Antaryämé, He who gives inspira-
tion. What to speak of Parameçvara, even the jévätmä  in the
pure state does not have the ego of being the doer of mate-
rial actions which are performed by the material senses.Those who know this are really in knowledge. It is also saidin Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.28.15):
çoka-harña-bhaya-krodha- / lobha-moha-spåhädayaù
ahaìkärasya dåçyante / janma-måtyuç ca nätmanaù
O Uddhava, the material ego is the only cause of lamentation,
happiness, fear, anger, greed, delusion, desire, birth and death.The pure ätmä  has no connection with them.
It is also seen in the T antra-bhägavata : ahaìkärät tu
saàsäro bhavet jévasya na svataù. It is only due to material
ego that this material existence of birth and death occurs forthe jévas . The pure jévas  have no relationship with such
material ego. However, in the jévas pure state he has the
ego of being kåñëa-däsa , with a human-like spiritual body,
name, form, qualities and activities which are all transcen-dental. He is not formless or without qualities.

Only because a person identifies himself with the body does
he see the various forms or bodies of others as devatäs , hu-
man beings, dogs, cats, çüdras , Hindüs, Muslims and so on.
The cause of this mundane differentiation is ignorance,whereby a person falsely identifies himself with the body. Dueto this ignorance, one forgets Bhagavän. When remembranceof Bhagavän appears within him by the influence of theassociation of çuddha Vaiñëavas, all his ignorance is dispelled
and his materialistic ideas of differentiation are removed. Atthat time, he becomes situated in brahma , which is endowed
with eight qualities. He perceives everything equally at alltimes and ultimately he attains parä bhakti . Sometimes in
the çästra , a jévätmä  endowed with these eight special quali-
ties has been called brahma  or brahma-bhüta . These eight
qualities are:
ya ätmäpahata-päpnä vijaro vimåtyur viçoko vijighitso pipäsaù
satya-kämaù satya-saìkalpaù sonveñöavyaù sa vijijïäsitavyaùÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !825
One should search for and know the ätmä  who is completely free
from: 1) the miseries arising from desires for sense objects, 2) thethreefold miseries such as old age, 3) death, 4) lamentation, 5)an enjoying propensity and 6) mundane aspirations. That ätmä  is
7) endowed with favourable desires to serve Kåñëa ( satya-käma ),
and 8) able to attain perfection in whatever he desires ( satya-
saìkalpa ).
 This is also explained in Gétä (18.54): brahma-bhütaù
prasannätmä. Ultimately, one who is a brahma-bhütätmä
achieves parä bhakti . The jévas  ultimate objective is to
achieve parä bhakti.  It is improper to say,  Param brahma
achieves parä bhakti  because parä bhakti  means to render
service to the feet of param brahma.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying: When
a man of true wisdom sees that, during annihilation, all
moving and non-moving jévas of various shapes are situated
in prakåti  only, and that at the time of creation those variet-
ies again manifest from the same prakåti , he becomes free
from the tendency to differentiate between material desig-nations. He then realises his real spiritual identity and hisrelationship with brahma (the Absolute Reality). Now I will
explain how the jéva, having acquired this knowledge of quali-
tative oneness, perceives Paramätmä, who is present as thewitness.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän said in Gétä  (13.22): käraëaà guëa-saìgo
sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu.  The jévätmä  and Paramätmä
equally reside in the body, yet only the jévätmä  becomes
materially conditioned by his implication in the guëas.
Paramätmä does not. Someone may raise the question,
How is that? For this reason, Çré Bhagavän speaks thisçloka  beginning with the word anäditvän . That which has
no cause or origin is anädi . When a word ending in the fifth
case (ablative) is used with the word anuttama , it will read
paramottama  (than whom no one is higher, the supreme).
In the same way, here the word anädi means the supreme
cause. Since, in the original çloka , anäditvät  is used in the
fifth case, the meaning is: He is the Supreme Cause.Nirguëatvät  means He who is free from the guëas,  or from
whom all qualities such as creation emanate. He is that
reality. Hence, Paramätmä is distinct from the jévätmä and
is avyaya  (imperishable). That is, His knowledge and bliss
never diminish. Çarira-stho pi  means that although He is
situated in the body, He does not accept the characteristics
of the body, and na karoti means that unlike the jéva, He
does not become the doer (the enjoyer), nor does He become
implicated by the qualities of the body, the modes of na-ture.ÇLOKA PRAKÅTI -PURUÑA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !827

Being avyaya  (imperishable), anädi  (beginningless) and
nirguëa  (free from the guëas ), Paramätmä, unlike the jéva,
does not become implicated in the characteristics of the body
even though He resides in the body. When the pure jéva at-
tains the state of brahma,  which is completely free from
material vision ( brahma-bhüta ), he understands that the
complete kñetra-jïa , Antaryämé, Parameçvara, is not at all
tainted by material qualities. He, the j éva, then becomes to-
tally aloof from the qualities of the body also, although heresides within it.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, When
the jévas have attained brahma realisation, they can understand
that Paramätmä is avyaya , anädi  and nirguëa . Although He
exists in the body along with the jévätmä , He does not become

the state of brahma  no longer become implicated in material
affairs. This is because they take shelter of this knowledge (aboutthe qualities of Paramätmä). Hear from Me how the jéva who
is not implicated by material qualities deals with this body.

Here, Çré Bhagavän speaks the çloka  beginning with the
words yathä sarva-gatam in which He  gives an example. The
sky pervades mud and other material objects due to its subtlenature, yet it does not become contaminated or mixed withthem. In other words, it remains untouched ( asaìga ) by mud
and so forth. Similarly, the brahma-bhüta realised ätmä, who
follows the path of Paramätmä, does not become influencedby the qualities and defects related to the body althoughresiding within it.

How does an object with the quality of illumination re-
main unaffected by the qualities of the object it illuminates?To explain this with an example, Çré Bhagavän is speakingthis çloka  beginning with the word yathä. The sun is the il-
luminator, yet it is not affected by the qualities of the ob-jects it illuminates. Similarly, kñetré,  or Paramätmä, does not
become affected by the qualities of kñetra  (the body).
It is also said in Katha Upaniñad  (2.2.11):
süryo yathä sarva-lokasya cakñur
na lipyate cakñuñair bähya-doñaiù
ekas tathä sarva-bhütäntarätmä
na lipyate loka-duùkhena bähyaù
The sun, like the eye of all beings, does not become affected by
the defects of anothers eye or any other external defect. In thesame way, the one Paramätmä is not subject to the happiness ormisery of anybody, even though He is situated in all beings.

Just as the one sun illuminates the whole universe even
though it is situated in the one place, in the same way, theätmä,  which is situated in one part of the body, illuminates
the entire body spreading consciousness throughout. Brahma-
sütra  (2.3.25) also says: guëäd vä lokavat. Although the
jévätmä  is atomic, it pervades the whole body by its quality34! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  13 830

Öhäkura translates the word kñetré  as Paramätmä, because
Paramätmä is the complete kñetra -jïa and the jéva is the
partial kñetra-jïa . The conscious jéva is kñetra-jïa  of a par-
ticular body, but Parameçvara is the complete kñetra-jïa  of
all bodies simultaneously.

Now, Çré Bhagavän is concluding this chapter. Those who
know kñetra  and kñetra-jïa , the jévätmä  and Paramätmä, and
the process such as dhyäna (meditation) by which the living
entities achieve mokña  from prakåti , attain the supreme des-

In concluding the subject of the kñetra  and kñeta-jïa Çré
Bhagavän says that an intelligent person should properly under-stand the distinguishing characteristics of the body and theknowers of the body who are the partial kñetra-jïa (the ätmä ),
and the friend of the ätmä (Paramätmä), who is the complete
kñetra -jïa. Those who realise this attain the supreme destination.
Initially, faithful people should associate with bhaktas  who
are tattva-darçés . By hearing highly effectual hari-kathä in
their association, they can easily attain knowledge ofbhagavat-tattva , jéva-tattva , mäyä -tattva  and bhakti-tattva .
Then, when their identification with the material body isremoved, they attain the supreme destination.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, All effects of the ma-
terial nature constitute kñetra . There are two types of tattva ,
paramätmä-tattva  and ätma-tattva , and both are kñetra-jïa .
According to the process described in this chapter, those whounderstand the difference between kñetra  and kñetra -jïa with
the eye of spiritual knowledge by following the process by
which all living entities attain deliverance from mundane
activities, very easily understand para-tattva  Çré Bhagavän,
who is beyond both kñetra  and kñetra -jïa.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The three guëas  of mäyä  are indeed the cause of bondage.
This is inferred just by their result. Bhakti  is the cause of the
symptoms which destroy the three guëas . This is being ex-
plained in the Fourteenth Chapter.
The previous chapter ( Gétä 13.22) stated: käraëaà guëa-
saìgo sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu. The cause of the jévas
taking birth in auspicious and inauspicious species is his at-tachment to the guëas . What are the guëas ? How does one
associate with them? What is the result of association withthe different guëas ? What are the symptoms of a person who
is influenced by the guëas , and how can he become free from
them? Expecting these questions, Çré Bhagavän is making adeclaration in this çloka  beginning with the words paraà
bhüyaù  in order to introduce the subjects on which He will
later elaborate. The word jïänam  means by which it is
known, or instruction, and param  means the best.

It is clearly described in the Thirteenth Chapter that in
saintly association even an ordinary person can become lib-erated from the bondage of material existence by knowingthe tattva  of the body, the jéva and Paramätmä. The jéva has
become bound in this material world only by his associationwith the guëas  of material nature ( prakåti ). In this chapter,
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa explains to His bhakta  Arjuna what the
guëas  are in detail, how they function, how they bind the
jéva, and how the jéva can attain parama-gati  (the supreme
destination) by becoming free from these guëas . With this
knowledge, many åñis and munis  have attained perfection and
the supreme destination. Even ordinary people become tran-scendental to the guëas  after acquiring this knowledge and
can attain the supreme status.ÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !835 2

The word sädharmyam  means mukti  characterised by

After acquiring ätma-jïäna  (transcendental knowledge of
the self), the sädhaka-jéva  acquires qualities similar to that
of Bhagavän, that is, many of his qualities become partiallyequal to the qualities of Bhagavän. Even after attaining mukti
and becoming free from the cycle of birth and death, hisindividual existence continues as an associate of ÇréBhagavän. He remains eternally engaged in prema-mayé sevä
to the lotus feet of Bhagavän, having become established in! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 836
his svarüpa . Therefore, the bhaktas  do not give up their
svarüpa , which is servitorship, even after mukti . The essence
of all Bhagavän Çré Kåñëas instructions is that the jévätmä
does not completely become one with Paramätmä by merg-ing with Him. Rather, the jévas çuddha-svarüpa  (pure form)
continues to exist separately from that of Çré Bhagavän, andin this pure form the jéva always remains engaged in prema-
mayé sevä  to Him. Great personalities like Çréla Viçvanätha
Cakravarté Öhäkura and Çréla Çrédhara Svämé have acceptedthe meaning of sädharmya  as särüpya-mukti  only. In the
fourth prameya  of Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëas commen-
tary in the book called Prameya-ratnävalé , he has written that
the words sämya  in the Muëòaka Upaniñad  (3.1.3) and
sädharmya in Gétä (14.2) should be understood to mean that,
even in the liberated state of mokña , there is a difference
between the jéva and Éçvara. He explains that the compo-
nent brahmaiva  in the çloka , brahma-vid brahmaiva bhavati
means like brahma . The word eva has been used in the sense
of similarity. Therefore, brahmaiva  means to acquire quali-
ties like that of Bhagavän, that is, to become free from birthand death. But the jéva can never carry out such functions
as the act of creation.
Çré Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa comments on the present çloka
as follows: When the faithful jéva acquires the above-stated
transcendental jïäna  by the worship of guru , while perform-
ing the sädhana of bhakti , he attains qualitative equality with
eight of Bhagaväns eternal qualities and becomes free frombirth and death. The çrutis  state that the  jévas  retain their
individuality even in the stage of mokña.  They never merge.
In other words, more than one jéva is seen there. T ad viñëoù
paramaà padaà sadä paçyanti sürayaù . Liberated people in
the stage of mukti  constantly see the abode of Çré Viñëu.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,  Jïäna
is generally saguëa.  Nirguëa-jïäna  is called uttama -jïäna
(topmost knowledge). By taking shelter of this nirguëa -jïäna ,
the jéva attains My sädharmya , that is, qualities similar to
Mine. Less intelligent persons think that by giving up mate-rial qualities, material form and material existence, the jéva
himself becomes bereft of all qualities, form and existenceand loses his identity. They are not aware that, just as allobjects in the material world are distinguished from eachother by their unique attributes ( viçeña ), similarly, the purest
unique attributes and qualities are situated in My Vaikuëöhadhäma , which transcends this material nature ( viçuddha -
viçeña-dhäma ). That pure, unique quality ( viçuddha-viçeña )
makes an eternal arrangement of transcendental form and
existence which is called My nirguëa-sädharmya (särüpya
which is beyond the guëas ). By nirguëa -jïäna , one initially
transcends the saguëa  material world, and attains the state
of nirguëa -brahma.  Transcendental qualities then become
manifest. When this occurs, the jéva never takes birth again
in the material world.

O Bhärata, My prakåti (mahad brahma) is the womb
which I impregnate with the jévas who are of the
taöasthä nature. All beings are born from this mahad
brahma alone.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The cause of material bondage is association with the guëas ,
which is the consequence of ignorance since time immemo-
rial. To explain this, Çré Bhagavän is describing how kñetra  and
kñetra-jïa  are born.  Mahad brahma , the great brahma , is My
place of impregnation ( mama yonir ). That which cannot be
divided by time and place and whose limit cannot be ascer-
tained is called mahat (great). Here brahma  refers to prakåti
because the creation is an expansion of brahma.  In this way,
the word combination mahad brahma  is formed.
In the çrutis , the word brahma  is also sometimes used for
prakåti . Dadhämi  means I place garbha  (the seed in the form
of the jéva) in that  prakåti , thereby impregnating it. Itas tv
anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm jéva-bhütäm (Gétä  7.5).
This statement mentions the source of the conscious enti-
ties, jéva-prakåti , as the marginal potency ( taöastha-çakti ),
and as the life of all beings. The word garbha  (conception)
describes this. T ataù  means, All jévas  (sarva-bhütänäm )
beginning from Brahmä are born as a result of My impreg-
nation.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In this material world, everything happens by the combi-
nation of kñetra  and kñetra-jïa  only, that is, by deha (the
body) and dehé (the jévätmä ).ÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !839
This combination of prakåti  (material nature) and puruña
(the jéva) happens by the will of Parameçvara. The scorpion
lays eggs in a pile of rice. People say that scorpions are born
from rice, but, in fact, rice is not the cause of the scorpionsbirth. Scorpions are actually born from eggs. In the same way,the birth of the jéva is not caused by material nature. Bhagavän
places the jéva (seed) in prakåti , but people think that  the jéva
is born from prakåti . Every jéva gets a different type of body
according to his past actions. Prakåti  simply creates various
material bodies under the supervision of Bhagavän. The  jévas
who identify themselves with their bodies enjoy happiness orundergo misery according to their past karma . It should be
clearly understood that Parameçvara is the original cause ofthe manifestations of the jévas and the universe.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, The
original tattva  of prakåti (mahad  brahma ) is the source of the
universe. I impregnate that brahma  (prakåti ) and all beings are
born from that prakåti . The material aspect of My parä prakåti
(transcendental nature) is that brahma  (material nature), into
which I place the seeds of taöastha , the jévas . All the  jévas  be-
ginning from Brahmä are born in this way alone.

After explaining how all  jévas  are born from prakåti  and

and how the  jévas  become bound by their association. Çré
Bhagavän is saying dehe, meaning that the jéva who identi-
fies himself as one with the functions of prakåti  is situated
in the body and becomes bound by the guëas . In fact the jéva
is imperishable, immutable and free from any material con-tact, but the guëas  bind him because of his association with
them. This association is caused by his ignorance since timeimmemorial.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The three guëas : sattva , rajas  and tamas  are born from
prakåti  and are manifest to perform the three functions of
creation, maintenance and annihilation of the universe.Prakåti  remains unmanifest when these three guëas  are in
their state of equilibrium. At that time, creation, sustenanceand annihilation do not take place.

soul. These modes are the effective causes of the creation, main-
tenance and destruction of this universe.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.23) also states:  sattvaà rajas tama
iti prakåter guëäù. The jévas who manifest from the taöastha-
çakti  receive the association of material nature ( prakåti ) due
to becoming averse ( vimukha ) to Kåñëa. By constitutional
nature, the  jévas  are beyond mäyä , but due to the ego of I
and mine caused by association with mäyä , they have fallen
into the bondage of this material existence in bodies gener-ated by prakåti . Lord Kapiladeva clearly instructs His mother
Devahüti in this way in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.26.6-7):
evaà paräbhidhyänena / karttåtvaà prakåteù pumän
karmasu kriyamäëeñu / guëair ätmani manyate
tad asya saàsåtir bandhaù / pära-tantryaà ca tat-kåtam
bhavaty akartur éçasya / säkñiëo nirvåtätmanaù
Because of his forgetfulness, the transcendental jéva accepts the
influence of the material energy as his field of activities, andthus actuated, he wrongly applies the activities to himself. Ma-terial consciousness is the cause of ones bondage, in which thejéva is forced to accept the conditions placed by the material
energy. Although the jéva does not do anything and is transcen-
dental to such activities, he is thus affected by conditional life.
In this way, due to the jévas forgetfulness of the activities
of prakåti , he considers himself the performer of the activi-
ties ( karma ) born of the modes of nature. In fact the jéva is
only a witness. He is not the performer of any action. He isthe parä çakti  of Éçvara called éça and himself is bliss per-
sonified. He is in the clutches of this material existence ofbirth and death because he acquired the ego of being the doeror performer. He, thus, becomes bound and is controlled bysense objects due to this bondage.ÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !843

Sometimes the jéva becomes excessively absorbed in the modes
of nature in the form of happiness, misery, etc. At that time, hebecomes bewildered because of his false ego, and he identifiesthe body with the self, thinking, I am the doer. The jéva help-
lessly wanders throughout the higher and lower species of life,such as devatäs , humans and animals, because he has the ego of
being the doer and because he performs improper actions causedby his association with material nature. Unable to become free
from the experience of mundane happiness and misery caused
by karma , he continuously receives bodies in the material world.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
This çloka  beginning with the word tatra  explains the char-
acteristics of sattva -guëa  and how it binds the jéva. Anämayam
means calm, or free from agitation. Because the jéva becomes
calm, attachment to the happiness of sättvika activities causes
him to possess an ego of being materially satisfied. And be-cause he is illuminated, attachment to knowledge in the ac-tivities of sattva -guëa  causes the jéva to possess an ego of be-
ing knowledgeable. The happiness and knowledge in thesedesignated states is due to ignorance which forces the jéva to
have such conceptions based on the false  ego. It is this egoalone which binds the jéva. However, O Anagha, sinless one,
you should not accept this agha ( sin), this characteristic of the
false ego, by which you think, I am happy or I am knowl-edgeable.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
It was described in the previous çloka  how the guëas  of
material nature ( prakåti ) bind the jéva in the body. The
present çloka  explains how sattva-guëa  binds the jéva. Of the
three guëas , sattva -guëa  is relatively pure, illuminating and
calm. It therefore binds the jéva to happiness and knowledge.
Some consider that mukti can be achieved simply by taking
shelter of sattva -guëa  because it is superior to the other two
guëas.  But this is not true. In his commentary on this çloka ,
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa says that this mundane knowl-edge, the discrimination between matter and consciousness,comes from sattva-guëa , as does the happiness of the satis-
fied body and mind. Due to attachment to such knowledge
and happiness, one becomes engaged in activities whichlead to that calm state of existence. However, the jéva has
to accept another body to experience the result of theseactions and becoming attached to that, he has to againÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !845
perform ac tion ( karma ). In this way, the cycle goes on and
he can never become free from the cycle of birth and death.An ego in sattva-guëa  is also sinful.This is the import of the
word anagha  (sinless) that is used to address Arjuna in this
çloka.  Therefore, Arjuna (the sädhaka ) is advised not to ac-
cept a sättvika  ego.

Know rajo-guëa  to be that which gives mundane pleasure.
To desire an object that one does not yet have is called tåñëä ,
and attachment to objects that have been already attainedis called saìga . That rajo-guëa , from which both tåñëä  and
saìga  are born, binds the embodied soul by attachment to
action knowingly or unknowingly, dåñöa (seen) or adåñöa (un-
seen). Attachment to fruitive action is solely due to tåñëä
(desire) and saìga  (association).7! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 846
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Since it imbues the baddha-jéva  with attachment to sense
objects, it is called rajo-guëa. The mutual attraction between
male and female is the specific quality of rajo-guëa . It gen-
erates a hankering in embodied beings to enjoy material ob-jects. Such a person wants honour in society or nation, abeautiful wife, good progeny, and a happy family. Such arethe characteristics of rajo-guëa .
The reason why the whole universe has fallen into the
bondage of mäyä is attachment to sense pleasures through
rajo-guëa . The influence of rajo-guëa  is visible everywhere
in modern society, but in ancient times sattva -guëa  pre-
dominated. Even a man in sattva-guëa  is unable to achieve
mukti , what to speak of one covered by rajo-guëa .

Ajïäna-jam  means that tamas (darkness)  is inferred or
perceived only by its result, which is ignorance. Therefore, it
is called ajïäna-ja , or ajïäna-janaka , meaning that it gives
rise to ignorance. Mohana  means that which causes delusion;
pramädaù  means madness; älasyam  means lack of endeav-
our, and nidrä means depression of the mind. These are all
symptoms of tamo -guëa .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
T amo -guëa  is the lowest of the three guëas . It is com-
pletely opposite to sattva -guëa . A person in tamo -guëa
considers the body and bodily pleasures as the all-in-all. Asa result, he loses all discrimination and becomes almost mad.Everyone comes to see that our father and grandfathers havedied; we will die and our progeny will also die. That meansthat death is certain. Yet those in tamo-guëa fail to search
for the self within. Simply to satisfy their senses, they col-
lect wealth by cheating, duplicity, violence and other simi-lar acts. This is madness. The specific characteristic oftamo -guëa  is that it makes one mad like this. Symptoms of
a person in tamo -guëa  are that he takes intoxicants, meat,
fish, eggs, wine, etc. He remains inactive, lazy, careless andheedless, and he oversleeps. A sädhaka  should totally aban-
don this mode.

the pre dominating mode. When the senses, such as the ears,
begin to acquire perfect knowledge of Vedic  sound and so
forth, one should know that sattva -guëa  is predominating.
The word uta is emphasising that illumination in the form
of happiness is generated by the self.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The symptoms by which one can understand which guëa
is predominating are explained here. It is understood thatsattva-guëa  is predominating when one is in proper knowl-
edge of objects by the means of the senses (such as the earsand nose) and when a feeling of happiness manifests fromthe soul. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.13) also states:
yadetarau jayet sattvaà / bhäsvaraà viçadaà çivam
tadä sukhena yujyeta / dharma-jïänädibhiù pumän
Sattva-guëa is illuminating, pure and peaceful. The jéva becomes
qualified to have happiness, virtue and knowledge, etc., whenthis quality increases by the restraint of rajo-guëa  and tamo -guëa .
Furthermore, in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.9) it is said:
puruñaà sattva-saàyuktam anuméyäc chamädibhiù. One
should recognise that a person who can control his mind andwho has other similar qualities is endowed with sattva -guëa .
When bhakti  to Me is mixed with the material modes, it
is called saguëa -bhakti .
It is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.10):
yadä bhajati mäà bhaktyä / nirapekñaù sva-karmabhiù

Karmaëäm  ärambhaù  means endeavours such as the build-

when he will again take a human birth after returning fromthat place. Therefore, it is the duty of every human being torise gradually from tamo -guëa  to rajo-guëa , and from rajo-
guëa  to sattva -guëa . And even beyond that, one should be-
come nirguëa , free from the guëas , by taking shelter of
çuddha-bhakti  in the association of çuddha-bhaktas . Only
that nirguëa  sädhaka  who takes shelter of nirguëa bhakti

fare of their personal life, society and people in general. Theiractions are called puëya-karma  (pious activities). Those who
perform puëya-karma  remain happy in this material world,
and they have more possibility of gaining sädhu-saìga . The
karma  performed by those in rajo-guëa  causes misery. Ac-
tions performed for momentary sense pleasure are useless. Thelives of such people are full of miseries, with no real happi-ness. The actions of a person predominated by tamo -guëa
are highly painful to him. After death, he has to take birthas a worm, bird, animal and so forth. To kill animals and
eat their flesh is the chief symptom of those in tamo -guëa .
Those who kill animals do not know that in the future thesame animal, in some form or other, will kill them. This isthe law of nature. In human society, if a person kills anotherperson, he is given the death penalty. This is the law of thestate. But ignorant people do not know that Parameçvara isthe original controller of the entire universe. He cannot tol-erate even the killing of an ant in His kingdom; therefore,such people must certainly undergo punishment. To engagein the killing of animals just for the sake of satisfying thetaste buds is a heinous offense. Among such actions, the kill-ing of a cow is severely punishable. The cow and bull are likeour mother and father. Therefore, in the Vedas  and Puräëas ,
the killing of cows is described as the most sinful act.
The cow with her milk is like a mother, and the bull by his
labour in farming is like a father. Thus, they nourish us like16! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 858
parents. Due to ignorance, the present so-called cultured
human beings neglect this fact. In this way, they clear thepath for their own degradation and for the degradation ofsociety as a whole. Thus, they are heading towards destruc-tion and taking all of society with them. In human societyat present, there is a predominance of rajo-guëa  and tamo-
guëa . This is dangerous for everyone. It is imperative for
intelligent people to become situated in sattva-guëa  and take
shelter of bhagavad-bhakti  and hari-näma-saìkértana  to pro-
tect humanity from this great danger. When one remembersBhagavän in sat-saìga , all ones ignorance is removed, his
worldly sectarianism and mundane discrimination are alldispelled, and he sees Parameçvara everywhere.

When the jéva sees no agent of action other than

to Me and attains to My spiritual nature.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
After describing the material world which consists of the
guëas , Çré Bhagavän is explaining mokña  (pure devotion),
which is quite distinct from the guëas , in this çloka  begin-
ning with the word nänyam and in the next çloka . When
the jéva does not see any other active agent except for the
guëas , which have been modified to become the doer, the
effect and the objects, he sees and realises that the guëas alone
are the active agents in every situation. He also realises thatthe ätmä  is superior to the guëas  and different from them .
Such a seer (the jéva) attains love for Me ( mad-bhävam ) or
säyujya  with Me. In other words, he attains to My spiritual
nature. At that time, even after he has acquired this knowl-edge, he only attains Me by performing bhakti . This will
become clear from the meaning of the twenty-sixth çloka  of
this chapter.

All jévas in different species of life from rivers, mountains
and ants, up to creepers, trees and human beings are work-ing while helplessly bound by the guëas . In reality, there is
no other active agent in all their actions except the threeguëas  of material nature. Parameçvara is completely beyond
material nature and the guëas , although He is their original
controller. Those who know this truth also cross over prakåti
and the guëas  to attain the supreme destination, but no one
can understand this merely by his own intelligence and dis-crimination. Therefore, it is of the utmost necessity to haveÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !861
the association of mahä-puruñas  who are well-versed in tran-
scendental knowledge. No matter how degraded a jéva may
be, in the association of great sädhus , he very quickly and
easily becomes transcendental to these three guëas .

In this çloka , Arjuna has questioned Çré Bhagavän about
the symptoms of a person who is beyond the three guëas.
What is his conduct and by what means did he attain thatstage? It is very important for every human being to ask thesequestions. These questions are essential for those who arereally enthusiastic to follow the teachings of the Gétä . Their
answers give instructions on how to transcend tämasika ,
räjasika and sättvika guëas  and achieve the state of nirguëa.
Then, by cultivating bhagavad-bhakti , one can attain the
highest goal in the form of bhagavat-prema.

to be the same, who is situated equally amidst pleasant andunpleasant events, who is intelligent, who remains equipoisedboth in criticism and glorification and in honour anddishonour, who treats friend and foe equally, and who hasrenounced all 
karma  except that required to maintain the
body.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
What symptoms indicate that one is guëätéta ? In response
to this first question, Çré Bhagavän says, The effect of sattva-
guëa is that knowledge illuminates all the senses of the body.
The effect of rajo-guëa  is passionate action, and the effect
of tamo -guëa  is delusion. These symptoms indicate the in-
fluence of the three guëas. When the guëas perform their
natural  functions, a person who is guëätéta has no animos-
ity towards them, because he understands them to be miser-able. Similarly, when the modes are not acting, one who isguëätéta  does not desire them with a yearning to attain hap-
piness. This çloka  (14.22) is related to 14.25. In response to
the second question: kim äcäraù , How do they behave? Çré
Bhagavän speaks three çlokas  beginning with the words
udäséna-vat . Those who are not disturbed by happiness and
misery, which are the effects of the guëas , always remain
fixed in their constitutional svarüpa.  They consider the guëas
to be working in their respective functions, and have no re-lationship with them. After careful deliberation, such wise
persons remain silent ( mauné ). Those who do not endeavour
for any bodily sense gratification are called guëätéta . A per-22-25! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 866
son can only be called guëätéta  when all the symptoms of
one who has transcended the modes are seen in his behaviour.But garrulous people who proclaim to have transcended themodes are not called guëätéta .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Upon hearing Arjunas three questions, Çré Bhagavän first
explains the symptoms of a person who is guëätéta . The func-
tion of sattva -guëa  is to illuminate, of rajo-guëa  is to en-
gage in passionate action, and of tamo-guëa  is to bewilder.
A jévätmä  is said to be guëätéta  when he is not averse to these
three guëas  while they are engaged in their respective func-
tions, seeing them as a cause of misery. Nor does he hankerfor pleasure from them when their functions cease. What ishis conduct? In response to this question, Çré Bhagavän saysthat a person who is beyond the guëas  does not become dis-
turbed in times of happiness or trouble, but remains indif-ferently situated. He is equally disposed to worldly happinessand misery, heat and cold, loss and gain, victory and defeatand, remaining neutral, understands that they have no rela-tionship with the ätmä . With this conception, he remains busy
only in the progressive development of the self ( ätmä ), and
is not the least concerned about bodily activities.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, After hearing Arjunas
three questions, Çré Bhagavän said, Your first question isWhat are the symptoms of a person who has transcendedthe guëas ? The answer is freedom from envy and desire. As
long as one is situated in this material world, the baddha-
jéva is under the influence of the guëas  of material nature:
sattva , rajas  and tamas . These three guëas  are only de-
stroyed when one attains complete mukti . But until, by
the will of Bhagavän, one has attained mukti  in the form
of the destruc tion of the subtle body, one should know thatÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !867
the process to become nirguëa  is to give up envy and desire
(material hankerings). As long as one has a body, there willcertainly be illumination, action and delusion (the functionsof sattva , rajo and tamo-guëa ), but one should not yearn for
them, nor should one try to renounce them out of aversion.Those in whom these two symptoms are visible are callednirguëa . Those who engage in materialistic activities with
effort because of the persistence of some selfish motive, orwho practise forced renunciation, considering this materialworld to be illusory, are not nirguëa .
Your second question is What is the conduct of a person
who is guëätéta ? His conduct is as follows: He thinks, The
guëas  themselves are working within this body. He lets the
guëas  perform their work, and does not become implicated
in them. He remains separate from them, as an indifferentperson who is nonetheless conscious. Misery, happiness, a clodof earth, stone, gold, favourable or unfavourable situations,
criticism or glorification, all appear as a result of his bodily
activities, but he keeps equal vision towards them and treatsthem equally, being situated in his own self or constitutionalposition. In his worldly dealings he thinks, As a consciousentity, I have no relationship with honour and dishonour andthe behaviour of enemies and friends. Giving up all feelingsof attachment and renunciation, he acquires the designationof guëätéta .

One who renders service with aikäntika-bhakti to

guëas  and become qualified to attain realisation of
brahma , My spiritual nature .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
How can one transcend these three guëas ? In response
to this third question, Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka
beginning with the words mäà ca . The word ca means Me
alone. Only those who render service to Me, Çyämasundara,
who am Parameçvara, become brahma-bhüyäya  or qualified
to experience My spiritual nature. This is proven by the useof the adjective ekayä  in the statement: bhaktyäham ekayä
grähyaù. I am attained only by aikäntika-bhakti . (Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  11.14.21)
According to Gétä (7.14): mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm
etäà taranti te. Only those who surrender unto Me, cross over
mäyä . It is also emphasised, by the use of the word eva, that
brahma  cannot be experienced by any means except with the
help of bhakti . The import of the word avyabhicäreëa  (unde-
viating) is that in bhakti-yoga there should be no mixture of
karma , jïäna , etc. Even niñkäma-karma  is to be given up. Re-
nounce even jïäna  of Me. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.19.1), it
is said: jïanan ca mayi sannyaset . One should surrender unto
Me both that knowledge and the means by which he achievedit. According to this statement, jïänés  renounce their jïäna
even when they have cultivated jïäna to its highest degree,
but it is never said that bhakti-yoga  has to be given up. ThereÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !869
are many types of bhakti , not all of which are avyabhicära .
Therefore, just as niñkäma-karma-yoga is given up by a  jïäné ,
a jïäné  can become guëätéta  only when jïäna -yoga is given
up and avyabhicära  (kevala-bhakti ) is performed. There is no
other means to attain the nirguëa  state. It is also said in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.26): A performer of action ( kartta )
who has taken shelter of Me, is nirguëa.  In other words, only
aikäntika bhaktas  are free from the modes.
sättvikaù kärako saìgé / rägändho räjasaù småtaù
tämasaù småti-vibhrañöo / nirguëo mad-apäçrayaù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.25.26
A person in sattva-guëa is unattached . One who is in rajo-guëa
is extremely attached, and a person in the mode of tamas  loses
his memory and can no longer discriminate. But one who has
taken shelter of Me is  nirguëa .
This çloka  (11.25.26) describes the karmé  and jïäné  who are
detached as tat-sähacarya-sädhakas  (sättvika sädhakas ), while
those who have taken shelter of Bhagavän are described asnirguëa . From this statement, it is understood that Kåñëas
bhaktas  are the only real sädhakas .
After becoming perfect in jïäna  and renouncing sattva-
guëa , a jïäné  becomes guëätéta , transcendental to the modes.
Çréla Çrédhara Svämépäda says, The word ca in this çloka  is
used to indicate a conclusion. Çré Madhusüdana Sarasvatéwrites, Only those who serve Me alone, Éçvara Näräyaëa,with avyabhicära-bhakti-yoga , exclusive devotion as described
in the Twelfth Chapter, become guëätéta. 
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
How do the above-mentioned people who are guëätéta  cross
beyond the three guëas ? In response to this third question,
Çré Bhagavän says, My bhaktas  easily cross over these guëas26! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 870
and become qualified to experience My svarüpa  as a result
of rendering service to Me in My Çyämasundara form, withavyabhicäré or aikäntiké bhakti-yoga . Those bhaktas  who
have taken shelter of Bhagavän become nirguëa.  This is veri-
fied in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.25.26): nirguëo mad-
apäçrayaù. Those who take exclusive shelter of Me are
nirguëa . The word mad-apäçrayaù  means mad-eka-çaraëo
bhaktaù.  Only a devotee who takes exclusive shelter of Me
is My äçritaù  (dependent on Me), and is nirguëa .
It is also seen in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.88.5):
harir hi nirguëaù säkñät / puruñaù prakåteù paraù
sa sarva-dåg upadrañöä / taà bhajan nirguëo bhavet
Certainly Çré Hari Himself is directly nirguëa , beyond the guëas
of material nature. He is the witness of everyone. Those who
perform bhajana to Him also become nirguëa .
Here, the word brahma-bhüyäya  means to become quali-
fied to realise brahma-tattva (the spiritual nature). Brahma
cannot be realised by any practice other than bhakti , and this
realisation requires that the person who will experience (thejéva) must be eternally distinct from that which is to be ex-
perienced ( parabrahma) . In other words, the jéva must have
a separate existence. The nirviçeña-vädés  (monists) do not
accept that the jéva and brahma  exist separately after mukti .
Therefore, it is not possible for them to experience Him. Onthe contrary, only bhaktas  are qualified to realise brahma .
One gets the power to realise brahma (Çré Bhagavän) through
bhakti  alone, by the mercy of Çré Bhagavän. This has been
stated very clearly in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.14.21):
bhaktyäham ekayä grähyaù. I can be attained only by bhakti. 
One cannot attain mukti  merely by jïäna . Only by the help
of bhakti , in some way or another, can one achieve mukti
through jïäna . This has been stated very clearly in manyÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !871
çlokas  in Çrémad-Bhägavatam , such as (1.5.12):
naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitaà
na çobhate jïänam alaà niraïjanam
Knowledge of self-realisation, even though free from all mate-
rial affinity, does not look well if devoid of a conception of theSupreme Lord.
Even if that jïäna is niñkäma  (selfless) and nirmala  (pure),
it is not auspicious if it is bereft of bhagavad-bhäva  (a ser-
vice attitude to Bhagavän). In other words, it is useless. Whatthen to speak of kämya-karma  (fruitive action), which is
always miserable and insignificant. Such jïänés  fall down
even after reaching the highest stage of jïäna : sthänäd
bhrañöäù patanty adhaù (Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.5.3). The
following çlokas  from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  can be referred
to in this regard: 10.2.32, 10.20.32, 11.14.21, 10.23.46 and 4.31.12.
Some people translate the word brahma-bhüyäya  in the
present çloka  to infer that the jéva becomes one with brahma .
But the jéva does not become one with brahma  even after he
has attained mukti . In the Chandogya Upaniñad , a brahma-
bhüta  (realised person) is described as having eight charac-
teristics:
ätmä pahata-päpnä vijaro vimåtyur viçoko vijighatso pipäsuù
satya-kämaù satya-saìkalpaù so nveñöavyaù
These are:
(1) Apahata-päpa He has no relationship with the sinful ten-
dencies of mäyä , such as avidya .
(2) Vijara He is free from old age, being eternally youthful.
(3) Vimåtyu There is no possibility of him becoming degraded.
(4) Viçoka He is free from mundane happiness, misery, etc.
(5) Vijighatsa He has no desire to enjoy sense objects.26! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 872
(6) Apipäsu He has no desire other than for bhagavat -sevä.
(7) Satya-käma He is  endowed with desires which are favourable
for Kåñëa sevä.
(8) Satya-saìkalpa He attains perfection in whatever he de-
sires.
According to the statement of Gétä (14.17): sattvät saïjäyate
jïänaà , jïäna  comes from sattva -guëa , therefore jïänés  are
sättvika . After attaining perfection in jïäna , a jïäné  gives
up his sättvika  nature and becomes free from all guëas , that
is, he becomes nirguëa . But the speciality of the bhaktas  is
that they are free from the guëas  from the beginning of their
sädhana.  Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.29.34) states:
martyo yadä tyakta-samasta-karmä
niveditätmä vicikérñito me
tadämåtatvaà pratipadyamäno
mayätma-bhüyäya ca kalpate vai
A mortal person attains immortality and becomes most dear to
Me at the very moment he fully surrenders to Me, having givenup all types of karma  (action), and having become nirguëa .
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments on the
çlokas : jïänaà viçuddhaà paramärtham ekam , The non-dual
Absolute Truth being devoid of material contamination gives
us liberation ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  5.12.11), and martyo yadä
tyakta-samasta-karmä , That surrendered mortal having given
up all fruitive desires and having offered Me his very life,achieves opulences like My own ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam
11.29.34). He writes: From the very beginning of the sädhana
stage, when one takes shelter of bhagavad-bhakti , Bhagavän
begins the treatment of the çaraëägata  (surrendered)  bhaktas.
That is, He starts to make them nirguëa . The meaning is
that a sädhaka  while practising bhakti  gradually becomesÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !873
situated in the stages of niñöhä , ruci and äsakti.  Eventually,
he attains rati and becomes completely nirguëa . At that time,
he has no relationship with illusory objects (body, house, etc.).By the inconceivable power of bhakti , even while he is be-
ing instructed in bhakti by Me, the transcendental body, mind
and senses of the bhakta  are created in a way that is hidden
or invisible. In other words, it is unknown to the jéva. Simi-
larly, his illusory body, mind and senses are removed in ahidden way. This shows the glory of bhakti.  At that time,
after being situated in his own svarüpa  in My dhäma , that
pure jéva becomes qualified to taste the bliss of rendering
service to Me.
In many places, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has
confirmed that a bhakta  becomes free from the guëas  even
during the sädhana  stage. Although objects such as a leaf,
flower, fruit, water and candana  appear to be material in-
gredients in the eyes of the non-devotees, when offered to
Bhagavän with devotion by the bhaktas  they become nirguëa
and attain a transcendental nature ( apräkåta-bhäva ). How
much more then is this true of the bhaktas when they fully
offer themselves? This is also confirmed in Caitanya-
caritämåta , Antya-lélä  (4.191):
prabhu kahevaiñëava-deha präkåta kabhu naya
apräkåta deha bhaktera cid-änanda-maya
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said The body of a bhakta  is never
material. It is considered to be transcendental, full of spiritualbliss.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
One may raise the question: How can Your bhaktas  attain
the state of nirguëa-brahma , which is possible only by expe-
riencing oneness with brahma ? In response, Çré Bhagavän
speaks this çloka  beginning with the word brahmaëo.  I am
indeed the basis ( parama-pratiñöhä ) of that brahma  and am
famous as the supreme basis of everything. Since brahma
depends upon Me, I am its shelter, or basis. The word pratiñöhä
(basis) has the same meaning as this in all çruti statements
such as annamaya. And furthermore, I am also the basis
(pratiñöhä ) of immortality  (amåta ). Is this amåta  heavenly
nectar? No! It means imperishable mokña : çäçvatasya
dharmasya. I am also the basis ( parama-pratiñöhä ) of bhakti ,
the supreme eternal dharma (sanätana-dharma ) which is
eternally existing both in the practice ( sädhana ) and perfected
(siddha ) stages, and I am the prema which is attained by
aikäntika-bhakti. Thus, since everything depends on Me,
one can attain the platform of brahma  (characterised byÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !875
merg ing with brahma ) by performing My bhajana  performed
with a desire to attain kaivalya . Kaivalya here refers to a
unique state of spiritual existence devoid of physical andmental activities. While commenting on this çloka , Çréla
Çrédhara Svämé quotes Kåñëa as saying, I am the pratiñöhä
(basis) of brahma , which means that I am concentrated
brahma . Although the sun is concentrated light, it is known
as the shelter of light. In the same way, although I am theform of Kåñëa ( kåñëa-svarüpa ), I am the basis ( brahmaëo hi
pratiñöhäham ) of nirviçeña-brahma . The Viñëu Puräëa  also
proves this point. That Viñëu is the shelter ( äçraya ) of all
auspiciousness. He is the shelter of citta (consciousness) as
well as of the all-pervading ätmä . While commenting on this
çloka , Çréla Çrédhara Svämé also writes that Viñëu is the
parama-pratiñöhä  (supreme shelter, or basis) of parabrahma ,
the omniscient ätmä . As Çré Bhagavän says in Gétä , I am
the pratiñöhä  (basis) of brahma .
In Viñëu-dharma  it is said, Among prakåti , puruña  and
brahma , only puruña , Väsudeva, is the Lord. This is the con-
clusion. The same çästra  also states, Just as Acyuta, para-
tattva  Çré Bhagavän, is parabrahma , He is also Paramätmä.
In His pastime of bringing back the sons of the brähmaëa ,
Çré Kåñëa tells Arjuna that parabrahma extends Himself as
various manifestations ( vibhütis ) throughout the entire uni-
verse. O Arjuna, that concentrated effulgence should beconsidered to be My effulgent svarüpa  (Hari-vaàça Puräëa ,
Viñëu-parva  114.11.12).
In Brahma-saàhitä  (5.40) it is also said, I perform bhajana
to that primeval Lord Govinda. Brahma , who is born from
His effulgence, divides the unlimited opulence in unlimitedbrahmäëòas (universes).
Also in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (8.24.38), Bhagavän Matsya
told King Satyavrata: At that time, I will respond to your27! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 876
questions, and by My mercy, My glory, popularly known as
parabrahma , will manifest in your heart and you will be able
to realise it completely.
Çré Madhusüdana Sarasvatés writes in his commentary:
The following doubt may be raised: How can Your bhaktas ,
having attained to Your bhäva  (transcendental nature), be-
come qualified to achieve that state of brahma  if You are
different from brahma ? Anticipating this doubt, Çré
Bhagavän says: brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham (pratiñöhä  implies
I alone am sufficient and complete). Since I am the basisof brahma , if someone realises Me, then his realisation is
sufficient and complete, and the realisation of brahma  is also
included in that.
According to the Amara-koña  dictionary, the word paryäpti
means the complete Absolute Reality. Çrila MadhusüdhanaSarasvaté has composed a çloka to establish that brahma  is
saviçeña :
parä-kåta-mana-dvandvaà paraà brahman naräkåtim
saundarya-sära-sarvasvaà vande nandätmajam aham
I worship the effulgent form of the essence of all beauty, the son
of Nanda Mahäräja, the parabrahma  who has a human form, and
who has put aside the duality of my mind.
The three guëas  alone create all the anarthas which are
obstacles on the path of perfection. This perfection for thejéva is ananya-bhakti , which he can only achieve when he is
free from the three guëas.  This is what has been explained
in this chapter.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä ,
by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura , on the Fourteenth Chapter of
Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä , which gives pleasure to the bhaktas
and is accepted by all saintly persons.ÇLOKA GUËA-TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !877
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çrila Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Arjuna as saying, If
You say that the attainment of brahma  is the ultimate goal
of all types of sädhana , then how is it possible for persons
who have realised brahma  to enjoy Your nirguëa-prema ?
In response, Çré Bhagavän says, In My eternal  nirguëa state,
in My svarüpa as Bhagavän, I place the conscious seed, the
jéva, who is of the taöastha-çakti , in the womb of My inert
material energy ( jaòa-çakti ). The mahad  brahma , the self-
effulgence of My body, is the first manifestation of My spiri-tual realm, and is My brahma  feature. When a baddha-jéva
advances to higher and higher stages by cultivation ofjïäna-yoga , he ultimately attains My feature of brahma .
This is the first step of the nirguëa  stage. Before attaining
this step he is bewildered by a nirviçeña  (featureless) feel-
ing due to having given up all attraction to mundane vari-ety. This nirviçeña-bhäva  is removed by becoming situated
in that nirguëa stage and by taking shelter of çuddha-
bhakti-yoga.  He then realises the stage of cid-viçeña  (tran-
scendental variety).
Åñis, such as Sanaka and Vämadeva, who first deliberated
on nirviçeña-brahma by following the path of jïäna , later
achieved nectar in the form of nirguëa -bhakti-rasa  by this
process. Unfortunately, those who are forced by their lowerdesire to achieve mokña (salvation) cannot properly situate
themselves in brahma-tattva , and therefore they do not attain
nirguëa-bhakti  as their highest stage of attainment. In the form
of nirguëa-saviçeña-tattva (the Supreme Personality of
Godhead), I am indeed the shelter ( pratiñöhä ) of brahma , which
is the supreme destination of the jïänés . Immortality, imper-
ishability, eternality, prema  in the form of nitya-dharma  (eter-
nal occupation) and the ever-blissful state of vraja-rasa  (the
mellows of Vraja), are all attainable by taking shelter of My27! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  14 878
kåñëa-svarüpa , that para-tattva  who is nirguëa  (beyond the
material modes) and full of variety ( saviçeña ).
Mukti-pradätä sarveñäà viñëur eva na saàçayaù . Viñëu
alone is the bestower of mukti.  Çruti  also says: tam eva
viditvätimåtyum eti. Merely by knowing Him, one becomes
free from the clutches of death ( Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.8).
Padma Puräëa  also says: viñëor anucaratvaà hi mokñam ähur
manéñinaù. The thoughtful sages who  have realised the
Absolute (those who are tattva-darçé ), say that mokña  means
service to the lotus feet of Bhagavän. Skanda Puräëa  says:
kaivalaya-daù paraà brahma visnur eva sanätanaù. Only
Viñëu, who is the supreme brahma , is beyond impersonal
oneness and is eternal.

the Vedic  hymns that establish fruitive activities. He who
knows the tattva  of this tree is the knower of the Vedas .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Kåñëa cuts the bondage to material existence and is also
detached (aloof) from it. The ätmä , or jéva, is an aàça  (part)
of Éçvara . Kåñëa alone is the puruña  who is beyond both
perishable ( kñara ) and imperishable ( akñara ) entities. All of
this is described in the Fifteenth Chapter.
In the last chapter it was said, Those who worship Me
with ananya-bhakti  transcend the guëas  and become quali-
fied to experience brahma  (Gétä  14.26). Now one may raise
the question, You have a human form, so how will one at-tain brahma-bhäva  (a spiritual nature) through bhakti-yoga
by worshipping You? In response Çré Bhagavän says, Inreality, I am indeed, a human being, but I am also the su-preme shelter and support  (pratiñöhä ) of that brahma . The
Fifteenth Chapter begins with an explanation of this point.In Gétä  (14.26) it was said, After transcending the guëas ,
they become qualified to realise brahma . What then, is the
nature of this material world consisting of the guëas ? From
where has it been generated? Who are the jévas who cross
beyond this material world by the performance of bhakti ?
What is the meaning of brahma  in the statement They be-
come qualified to realise brahma ? Who are You as the
pratiñöhä  (shelter and basis) of brahma ? Expecting these ques-
tions, Çré Bhagavän uses highly ornamental language to de-scribe this material world by saying that it is a wonderfulbanyan ( açvattha ) tree. Satya-loka is its topmost region. The
mahat-tattva  is the first sprout of the seed impregnated by
Me into the womb of prakåti. 
Adhaù  means that the branches of this tree are extendedÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !881 1
downwards to such planets as Svarga, Bhuvaù and Bhü, as
unlimited devatäs , Gandharvas, Kinnaras, Asuras, Räkñasas,
Pretas, human beings and animals, such as cows, horses, birds,swans, insects and non-moving living entities. For the fruitiveworkers (non-devotees), this tree gives the fourfold objectsof dharma , artha , käma  and mokña  as its fruits. For this rea-
son, it is called uttama  (the best).
Another meaning of the word açvattha is, that according
to the perception of bhaktas , this material world will not exist
in the future. In other words, for them it is temporary andsubject to destruction. But for non-devotees, it is avyayam ,
eternal. Statements which establish fruitive activities aregiven in the Vedas . Chandäàsi  means that those people who
desire opulence will perform yajïa  to Väyu-deva (the devatä
of air) by offering a white goat, and those who desire prog-eny will perform yajïa  to the eleven Indras. Since fruitive
activities make the material world expand, they are like the
leaves on the tree of the Vedas . The tree only appears beau-
tiful due to its leaves. Those who know this are called theknowers of the Vedas . Also, it is said in Kaöha  Upaniñad
(2.3.1), This material world is an eternal açvattha  (banyan)
tree which has its roots upwards and branches downwards.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the previous chapter, it was explained that a jéva becomes
qualified to experience brahma  only by bhakti  to Çré Kåñëa.
This is because only Çré Kåñëa Himself is the shelter ( äçraya )
of brahma. In the present chapter,  puruñottama-yoga  is be-
ing explained to clearly express information about Kåñëassvarüpa . Çré Kåñëa, the origin or root shelter of the material
world, is the supreme tattva . His vibhinnäàça  (separated
parts), the jévas, not recognising Him, have neglected His
service, and from time immemorial are bound in the cycle ofmaterial existence, birth and death, while wandering! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 882
throughout various species of life, suffering the three-fold
miseries. They are unable to get out of the cycle of mate-rial existence because they repeatedly become attached tothe fruits of their actions. In this chapter, Bhagavän ÇréKåñëa, by His causeless mercy, is giving instruction in a verypleasing way about the nature of this material world inorder to bring these helpless jévas  out of the cycle of karma
and create in them a feeling of renunciation towards thematerial world. He explains this subject very simply by com-paring the material world to a banyan tree. Just as a ban-yan tree expands enormously with unlimited branches, sub-branches, leaves, flowers and fruits, in the same way, thismaterial world also expands itself, its various branches be-ing the Åg, Säma , Yajuù  and Atharva Vedas . Its leaves are
the Vedic  hymns which establish instantly pleasing fruitive
activities. Thus, this tree of material existence appears asthe bestower of the fruits of dharma , artha , käma  and mokña
to the baddha-jévas who are bound by the results of their
karma.  The sight of this tree is so instantly pleasing, that
a baddha-jéva  cannot know that its fruits are poisonous and
he becomes attracted to it. However, bhaktas who realise
that its fruits are poisonous, describe it as a tree that hasto be cut with the weapon of renunciation. The name ofthis tree, açvattha , means na çvaù sthäsyäti  (it will not exist
in the future). Those who have this understanding that thematerial world is temporary, are the knowers of the Vedas .
Bhagavän has clearly refuted the mäyävädés understand-
ing that this material world is false or a dream. All the state-ments of çästra  and Çré Bhagavän clearly establish the fact
that this material world is a reality, but that it undergoeschanges and is periodically annihilated; therefore, it is per-ishable.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Çré Bhagavän as say-ÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !883
ing, O Arjuna, if you think that it is better to take shelter
of material life by following the statements of the Vedas , then
listen. This material world, which is caused by karma
(fruitive activities), is a special type of açvattha  tree. For those
who take shelter of karma , this tree is imperishable (ever-
existing) and its roots spread upwards. The statements of theVedas  which establish fruitive activities are its leaves, and
its branches spread downwards. This means that this treegives the results of the jévas karma  through Me, the Supreme
Absolute Reality. Those who know the temporary nature ofthis tree, indeed know its reality.

The branches of this tree of the material world are
spread everywhere. Adhaù  means in the lower species, such
as animals, and ürddhva  means in the higher species, such
as the devatäs . As a tree is nourished by pouring water on
it, this tree of the material world is nourished by the dif-ferent tendencies of the guëas , such as sattva-guëa . Sense
objects, such as sound, are its shoots. Moreover, some be-
lieve that a great treasure is hidden beneath the originalroots of the tree. Like the banyan tree, this tree also hasbranches and external tangles. Although the origin of theroots is in Brahma-loka, its other roots are in human so-ciety. These roots, which take support from karma (fruitive
activities), are ever-expanding. After undergoing the re-sult of his actions by receiving a body in any of the spe-cies, a jéva again engages in karma  in the human form of
life.

axe of intense detachment, it is imperative to search out the
lotus feet of that primeval person, Çré Bhagavän, which arethe root of this beginningless tree of
 saàsära , and take shel-
ter of Him. Having surrendered to and attained Him, fromwhom the cycle of birth and death in the material world hasexpanded, one never returns to this 
saàsära .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In this mortal world, the svarüpa  (actual form) of this tree,
as described above, certainly cannot be understood. Manyopinions on this tree are found: It is true; It is false; It iseternal. Because this tree has no limit, it is endless, and be-cause it has no beginning, it is beginningless. It also has nosubstratum or support. What then, is its basis, or foundation?What is it? A person bereft of tattva-jïäna  cannot under-
stand it. However, whatever it may be, knowing asaìga , de-
tachment, to be the only remedy for the jévas  endless mis-
ery, one should cut down this tree with the weapon of de-tachment and search for the great wealth present at its roots.Hence, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka describing the açvattha
tree. Here the word asaìga  in the third çloka means detach-
ment from everything. Cutting down this tree with the axeof detachment, one should search for brahma , which is the
great wealth and root (origin) of the tree.
What is the nature of that origin? In response to this, Çré
Bhagavän says, Having attained that destination, that origi-nal state, one never returns to this temporary material world.
How is one to search for this? In response, He says, One
must take shelter of that primeval puruña  and engage in
bhajana  to Him from whom this material world, which is
without beginning, has expanded. Therefore, it is imperativeto search for Him with bhakti .ÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !887

Ordinary people cannot understand the reality of this tree
of material existence. That is, they are unable to ascertainits beginning, end and foundation. Even after understand-ing the sequence of how this material world was created fromthe mahat-tattva  to ahaìkära  (the false ego), etc., they still
remain unaware of the fact that the original support of
material nature is Parameçvara, the actual shelter of every-one. Because the jéva is averse to Bhagavän, he is bewildered
by mäyä  and is bound to material existence consisting of the
three guëas.  Impelled by these guëas , he wanders to the lower
and higher regions of this material world, and becomes com-pletely helpless and exhausted. He feels the need to cut thistree of material existence, but he cannot find its root. It is
only possible to cut attachment to the material world by
practising bhakti  in sat-saìga ; this enables one to develop
intense detachment from the world. With this understand-ing, a fortunate jéva surrenders to the lotus feet of parama-
tattva Çré Hari and begins to perform bhajana  to Him. As a
result, he becomes free from the clutches of the material worldand attains eternal service to Çré Bhagavän in His abode. Thisis also described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.18):
tasyaiva hetoù prayateta kovido
na labhyate yad bhramatäm upary adhaù
tal labhyate duùkhavad anyataù sukhaà
kälena sarvatra gabhéra-raàhasä
Intelligent people should endeavour only for that transcenden-
tal happiness of the self, which cannot be attained by wander-ing from Brahma-loka in the upper planets to Sutala-loka in thelower planets. However, as far as sense pleasures are concerned,they are automatically obtained in due course of time, just as inthe course of time we receive miseries, even though we do notdesire them.3 - 4!

Moreover, in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.37) it is said:
bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd
éçäd apetasya viparyayo småtiù
tan-mäyayäto budha äbhajet taà
bhaktyaikayeçaà guru-devatätmä
The jéva has lost his memory due to his aversion to Parameçvara.
This aversion has directed the jéva to be absorbed in sense ob-
jects. In other words, he misidentifies his own self with the bodyin the external illusory energy consisting of the three guëas.  The
guëas  arouse fear in him because of this absorption. Conditioned
jévas are bound by mäyä . Learned persons should, therefore, take
shelter of the lotus feet of Çré Guru, and perform bhajana  with
ananya-bhakti  unto Çré Kåñëa. In this way, they can cross over
mäyä .

What are the symptoms of people who attain the abode of
the primeval puruña , Çré Bhagavän, having attained bhakti to
Him? In response to this question, Çré Bhagavän speaks thisçloka  beginning with the words nirmäna-mohä . Adhyätma-

ing what is eternal and what is temporary remain engaged indeliberation upon Paramätmä and the search for Him.

Here the word padam avyayam  means the eternal position
of bliss. Prema-mayé sevä to the lotus feet of Çré Bhagavän is
the only eternal position. To obtain service to the lotus feetof Çré Bhagavän in any one of the rasas  in His dhäma , it is
first compulsory to surrender to His lotus feet. But it is noteasy to surrender to Him. As long as a jéva remains intoxi-
cated by the false ego related to the subtle and gross body, hethinks himself to be the controller of prakåti . In such a state,
he disregards Çré Bhagavän and His bhaktas , and does not
accept their instructions. But when, by the mercy of
Bhagavän or His bhakta , the jéva is punished by material
nature in the form of various miseries, he begins to realisethat Parameçvara is the master of prakåti  and that he him-
self is completely powerless and helpless. Birth and death,loss and gain, fame and infamy are all under the control ofParameçvara alone, and the jéva is just like a puppet in His
hands. Realizing this fact, he surrenders to the feet of5! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 890
Bhagavän. At that time, his path of bhakti  becomes blessed
and excellent. The present day non-devoted person thinksthat this land, country and earth belong to him, and thathuman society is their controller, but this is an illusory con-ception. Such an illusory conception is the root cause ofbondage and of all miseries. Çaraëägati  (surrender) alone is
the doorway to spiritual life, the realm of bhakti .

What is the nature of that supreme realm? In response
to this, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the
words na tad . That place is free from miseries, such as heat
and cold, and is self-luminous. That supreme dhäma of Mine
is topmost, conscious and beyond the scope of the materialsenses. It is tejaù , all-illuminating. It is said in the Hari-vaàça
Puräëa  that parabrahma , who is superior to brahma , has
divided the universe and made it appear in various forms. OÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !891
Bhärata! You must know about that concentrated effulgence

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The svarüpa  of Bhagaväns dhäma is explained in the
present çloka . After reaching that abode, one does not have
to come back again to the material world. That abode is not
illuminated by the sun, moon, fire or lightning. It is self-
effulgent. That supreme abode is called Goloka, Kåñëa-loka,
Vraja, Gokula or Våndävana. Svayaà Bhagavän, Vrajendra-
nandana Çré Kåñëa, eternally performs blissful pastimes in
His supreme dhäma  along with His associates. One can only
obtain that dhäma  by the cultivation of prema-bhakti , that
is, rägänuga-bhakti  which specifically follows the footsteps
of the Vraja gopés . It is impossible to achieve it by any other
means. Çré Kåñëa has indicated that very dhäma  by the words
paramaà mama .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Sun,
moon or fire cannot illuminate that immutable dhäma  of
Mine. After reaching that dhäma , the jéva attains eternal bliss.
In reality, the jéva is either baddha (bound) or mukta (liber-
ated). Due to falsely identifying the body with the self, thejéva in his bound state desires to associate with matter. In the
liberated state, the pure jéva always tastes the nectar of My
blissful sevä. To attain this state, it is imperative for a person
situated within this world to cut the açvattha  tree in the form
of the material world with asaìga , the weapon of detachment.6! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 892
Attachment to mundane objects is called saìga . The nature
of those who are able to give up attachment, even while situ-
ated within this mundane world, is nirguëa , and only they
achieve nirguëa-bhakti . Sat-saìga  is also called asaìga .
Therefore, a jéva who is bound in this material world should
give up attachment to mundane objects and, with the help
of sat-saìga  (the association of bhaktas ), cut his bondage to
the material world at the very root. The mundane existence
of those who pretend to practise vairägya  (detachment) by
merely accepting the dress of a sannyäsé  does not cut their
material entanglement. When a jéva adopts My supremely bliss-
ful bhakti  and gives up all desires that are separate from Me, a
secondary result is that he attains mukti , or the destruction of
his bondage to the material world. Therefore, that bhakti  which
I have described (in the Twelfth Chapter) is the ultimate goal
of the jévas who desire eternal auspiciousness.
In the previous chapter, it was explained that all types of
empirical  jïäna  are saguëa , and that only pure jïäna  which
acts as an assistant to bhakti  is nirguëa . In this chapter, it is
shown that all types of vairägya  are saguëa , except for that
vairägya  which arises as a concomitant result of bhakti.  That
vairägya  is nirguëa .

What is the nature of the jévas who, by performing Your
bhakti , cross beyond this material world and obtain Your
dhäma ? In response to this question, Çré Bhagavän speaks
this çloka  beginning with the word mamaiväàçaù . In the
Varäha Puräëa  it is said, The aàças  of Bhagavän are of
two types, sväàça  (a personal expansion or part) and
vibhinnäàça  (a separated expansion or part). The jévas  are
vibhinnäàça , separated parts. The jévas  are eternal, but
while living in material bodies, they are bound by mundaneattraction through the mind and the five senses. Due to suchan ego whereby they think, All these things are mine, theybecome attracted to worldliness as if pulled by a chainbound to their feet.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the present çloka , Çré Bhagavän is explaining jéva-tattva .
The jéva is an aàça  (part) of Bhagavän, but what type of
aàça  should be understood. Çré Bhagaväns aàças  are of two
types: sväàça  and vibhinnäàça . Within the sväàça  category
is viñëu-tattva . Avatäras such as Matsya, Kürma, Nåsiàha
and Räma are sväàça-tattva . Jévas  are vibhinnäàça-tattva .
When sac-cid-änanda Bhagavän is parted from all other
energies and is only endowed with His taöastha-çakti , His
separated parts are called vibhinnäàça-tattva .
This is also explained in the following manner: The jévas7! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 894
who are generated from the jéva-çakti  or taöastha-çakti , which
is non-different from Bhagavän, are vibhinnäàça -tattva .
Some of their characteristics are qualitatively the same asBhagaväns, and other qualities are different. Hence, theirrelationship with Bhagavän is inconceivably and simulta-neously one and different, acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva .
Jévas  have two states: bound and liberated. In the liberated
state, the jéva is free from illusory designations and remains
engaged in service to Bhagavän, but in the bound state, heremains entangled in the material world, being covered bythe illusory designations of gross and subtle bodies. In Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.11.4), this has been explained in the follow-
ing way:
ekasyaiva mamäàçasya / jévasyaiva mahä-mate
bandho syävidyayänädir / vidyayä ca tathetaraù
O most intelligent Uddhava, the jévas are the separated parts of
Me, who am advitéya-svarüpa (one without a second, the non-
dual Absolute Reality). Due to  avidyä , they have become bound,
and by vidyä they attain mukti .
And moreover, it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.7.5): yayä
sammohito jévaù . Due to this external energy, the jéva, although
transcendental to the guëas , thinks himself a material prod-
uct and, thus, undergoes the reactions of material suffering.
By speaking this çloka , mamaiväàço jéva-loke , The jéva is
My separated part, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa herein refutes theillusory conception of those who say that the jéva himself is
brahma .
Besides this, by using the word sanätanaù (eternal), Çré
Bhagavän refutes the opinion of the mäyävädés. They say
that, when brahma  accepts the shelter of mäyä , brahma  is
known as the jéva, and when freed from mäyä , he again
becomes brahma . From this çloka , it is clear that the jéva isÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !895
an eternal entity, sanätana-tattva . He can never merge into
the existence of anything else, or be destroyed. The exist-ence of the jéva is eternal, both in his liberated and in his
bound state. The jéva always remains a jéva. He never be-
comes brahma . This fact has been established in Gétä  (2.23-
24). If the jéva had ever been brahma , or if he were non-
different from brahma  in all respects, he would not have
had to become bound in the material world. In other words,he would not have to suffer material miseries. Satyaà
jïänam anantam.  The Absolute Reality is truth, knowl-
edge and limitless. According to this statement of çästra ,
it is impossible for brahma  to be in illusion or ignorance.
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, therefore told the famousadvaita-vädé , Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya, Parameçvara is
the controller of mäyä , and the jévas  are under the control
of mäyä. This has been established in çästra.  But you are
saying that the jéva and Éçvara are the same, which is com-
pletely against the injunctions of çästra .
The çrutis  very clearly declare that the jéva is not brahma :
vasanti yatra puruñäù sarve vaikuëöha-mürtayaù (Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  3.15.14).  People who are free from mäyä  can
acquire a form suitable to reside in Vaikuëöha and serve
Çré Näräyaëa, the master of Vaikuëöha. In other words,
after obtaining särüpya-mukti  (a spiritual nature and form)
they serve Çré Näräyaëa. Çré Kåñëas words in the presentçloka  such as jéva-bhütaù , mamäàçah and sanätanaù  also
show the futility of the opinion of those who say that this
material world is false, and that the jéva and brahma  are
one.
Other mäyävädés (pratibimba-vädés ) accept the jéva and
inert matter to be a reflection of brahma , but this concep-
tion is also speculative and futile for the following reasons.
1) If brahma  is all-pervading, what possibility is there of His
having a reflection? 2) Who is the person who sees the re-7! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 896
flection, and where exactly is He reflected? If the jéva is con-
sidered to be the seer, and avidyä (ignorance) the place of
reflection, one has to accept the existence of two objects
which are separate from brahma , that is, the jéva and mäyä
in the form of ignorance. How, then, can brahma  be ekam
evädvitéyam , one without a second,  and how can He be all-
pervading? 3) Brahma  is not the object of perception, in other
words, He is without energy, transformation or qualities and
is nirguëa-tattva.  How can transcendental brahma  be divided
if even the material element sky, cannot be divided? There-
fore, the mäyäväda  philosophy, that brahma  has divided into
parts as the jéva (pariccheda-väda ), is also completely base-
less. Çästra says that brahma  is avikäré , without any trans-
formations. This means He cannot be transformed into a jéva
or into matter. We see, therefore, that both the concepts of
the mäyävädés : pratibimba-väda  (that the jéva and inert
matter are a reflection of brahma) and pariccheda-väda  (that
brahma has divided into parts as the jéva) are illusory. One
may argue that this assertion contradicts Vedic  statements
such as sarvaà khalv idam brahma , Everything is brahma ,
and tat tvam asi , You are that (meaning that the  jéva is
brahma ). However, all çästras , including the Upaniñads and
Vedänta , explain that it is Bhagaväns çakti , and not
Bhagavän Himself, which has transformed into the jévas and
the universe. Bhagavän ( brahma ) is non-different from His
çakti , so the jéva and this material world, which are trans-
formations of the çakti of brahma , are also non-different from
brahma . That there is a difference between the jéva, brahma
and Bhagavän has been established from the statements of
the çrutis , such as nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm , and
in various statements in Gétä. For example, Gétä (15.18) states:
I am puruñottama-tattva , the Supreme Person, beyond both
perishable and imperishable entities.
Thus, everything consists of brahma , but parabrahma  is ÇréÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !897
Kåñëa  Himself, and is indeed beyond everything. The
mäyävädés falsely assert that the statement tat tvam asi in
the Upaniñads means you are that, but this speculation is
against the injunctions of çästra . The real import of this
statement is, you belong  to Him; you are the servant of
Bhagavän. All Vedic statements have established this to be
the meaning of tat tvam asi.
Çaìkaräcärya explains the following two statements:
åtaà pibanto sukåtasya loke guhäà
praviñöau parame parärdhe
Kaöha Upaniñad  1.3.1
Having entered within the cave of the heart, both Paramätmä
and the vijïänätmä  (self-realised soul) drink the nectar of the
truth for a very long time.
And:
guhäm praviñöäv ätmänau hi tad-darçanät
Brahma-sütra  1.2.113
Certainly the two souls have entered the cave so that the Su-
preme Lord may reveal His glories to the jévätmä .
Çaìkaräcärya, what to speak of others, has accepted the
existence of two separate puruñas  due to the grammatical
construction of the word ätmänau . These two puruñas are
vijïänätmä  (the jéva) and Paramätmä. In various places in
the çrutis , the difference between the jéva and brahma  has
been shown by explaining that Parameçvara is vibhu (all-
pervading), and the jéva is aëu (atomic). Some examples of
this are as follows:
(i) yathägneù kñudrä visphulingä  (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad
2.1.20). ...just as tiny sparks from a fire fly in all directions.
(ii) bälägra-çata-bhägasya çatadhä kalpitasya ca  (Çvetäçvatara

of a hair and again divided by one hundred is considered to be
the size of the jéva, and such  jévas are declared to be eternal.
(iii) eño ëur ätmä cetasä veditavyo  (Muëòaka Upaniñad  3.1.9).
This tiny ätmä , who reposes on the five kinds of vital airs,
should be understood through the mind. The entire conscious-ness of the living beings is extended throughout by those lifeairs, and in the fully pure state of consciousness, that  ätmä
becomes manifest.
(iv) yathä samudre vahavaç taraìgä  (T attva-muktävali  10). ...
as in the ocean there are many waves.
(v) aëu hi jévaà prati-deha-bhinnam  (Daça-çloké  by Nimbarka).
The jévätmäs  are certainly of atomic dimensions and are
situated in every body.
(vi) hlädinyä saàvidäçliñöah sac-cid-änanda éçvaraù / svävidyä-
samvåto jévaù saìkleça nikaräkaraù  (Çréla Çrédhara Svämé).
The Supreme Lord, who is the embodiment of eternity, cog-
nisance and bliss, is embraced by full cognisance of His plea-
sure potency.
(vii) yah sarveñu bhuteñu tiñöhan sarvebhyo bhütebhyontaro
(Båhad-Äraëyaka Upaniñad 3.7.15). The jévätmä , being im-
mersed in ignorance of his true nature, experiences helpless-ness amidst a multitude of sufferings.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, If you
doubt how the jévas attain these two states, then listen. I am
Bhagavän, the complete sac-cid-änanda . I have two types of
aàça : sväàça  and vibhinnäàça . As sväàça , I perform léläs in
forms such as Räma and Nåsiàha. As My vibhinnäàça , I have
manifested jévas, who are My eternal servants. In sväàça-tattva
the ego of My Supreme Lordship fully exists ( ahaà-tattva ).
In My vibhinnäàça , however, I do not have ahaà-tattva , the
ego of being Parameçvara, and therefore a separate, individual
ahaà-tattva ego appears. This jéva, vibhinnäàça-tattva , hasÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !899
two states: mukta (liberated) and baddha (bound). In both
states, the jéva is eternal. In the liberated state, the jéva is
completely dependent upon Me and has no relationship with

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
What does he do when he is attracted by the senses?
Expecting this question, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  be-
ginning with the words çaréraà yad aväpnoti . Whatever gross
body is attained by the jéva, the master of the body and senses,
is controlled by karma.  From whichever body he leaves, he
carries these senses along with the subtle elements from hisprevious body. He then enters a new body, just as the wind8! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 900
carries an aroma along with subtle elements from its source,
such as a flower garland or sandalwood, to another place.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çré Bhagavän is explaining how a baddha-jéva  achieves
another body. After death, his bound state does not cease.Until a jéva becomes free from the material world by per-
forming bhagavad-bhajana , he has to take repeated births
according to the impressions of his previous actions. By us-
ing an example, Çré Bhagavän is explaining how he gets a
new body. Väyu  (the wind) carries the aroma from flowers
but does not carry the flower, which remains where it is.Similarly, the jéva gives up his gross body at the time of death
and accepts the shelter of another gross body, carrying themind with its desires and the senses along with him. In thisway, he repeatedly accepts different bodies according to theactions he performs, based on his desires. This is also de-
scribed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.22.36):
tan mamäkhyähi govinda / durvibhävyam anätmabhiù
na hy etat präyaço loke / vidväàsaù santi vaïcitäù
It is only the mind which has the impressions of karma , and along
with the five senses, travels from one body to another. The ätmä
is different from that, but he follows the mind because ofahaìkära , the false ego.
 This is also stated by Kapiladeva in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(3.31.43):
dehena jéva-bhütena / lokäl lokam anuvrajan
bhuïjäna eva karmäëi / karoty avirataà pumän
Due to his particular type of body, the conditioned jéva wanders
from one planet to another, following his material desires. In
this way, he involves himself in fruitive activities and enjoys the
result incessantly.ÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !901
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, It is not that ones
bound state of life ends after death. The jéva gets another
gross body according to his past actions, and in due course
of time, he will also give that up. While going from one
body to another, he carries with him desires for activitiesrelated to the body. Just as the wind travels to anotherplace carrying the aroma from its source, such as flowersor sandalwood, the jéva travels from one gross body to
another gross body along with the subtle elements and thesenses.

Parameçvara is the original cause behind the existence or
manifestation of all entities, feelings, elements, actions and
qualities of this world. He thinks that the root cause of all
existence is earth, water, fire, air, sky, moon, sun, electricity
and so on. Here Çré Kåñëa clearly says that the sun, moon,
fire and electricity manifest from Him alone. Bhagavän alone
is the bestower of enjoyment and liberation upon the jéva.
He creates seen and unseen varieties of enjoyment for the
jévas by making His partial splendour enter the sun, moon,
etc.
A jéva can easily comprehend the above tattva  by practis-
ing bhakti-yoga. In this way, He can understand this aspect
of Çré Bhagaväns splendour ( vibhüti-yoga ) that He is ex-
plaining. However, a jéva who is bewildered by mäyä  can never
realise this reality. Being overpowered by the mundane false
ego, he endeavours in vain to establish his control over all
things, such as water, air, sun, moon and wind, in order to
exploit them for his own material enjoyment. It is best for
him to give up these futile endeavours and follow the pro-
cess of bhakti  by surrendering to Bhagavän. By this simple
and easy process, he can attain eternal peace and happiness,
otherwise not.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, If you
say, A jéva situated in this material world is unable to delib-
erate on anything except matter, so how is it possible for him
to deliberate on conscious reality? then the answer is that
the splendour of My spiritual existence is also in this mate-
rial world. By taking support from it, it is possible to gradu-
ally attain a pure spiritual state which results in the destruc-
tion of the material state. The splendour in the sun, moon
and fire which illuminates the whole world is indeed only
Mine.12! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 906

this, Çré Bhagavän speaks this and the next two çlokas  be-
ginning here with the words dväv imau . In this universe con-
sisting of the fourteen planetary systems, there are two con-scious puruñas  (beings). Who are they? In answer to this, Çré
Bhagavän says, One who fails to act according to his con-
stitutional identity is kñara  (the fallible) jéva, and He who
never falls from His own svarüpa  is akñara  (the imperish-
able) brahma . Çruti  says,  Brähmaëas , the knowers of
brahma , call Him akñara . Also in småti , only brahma  is called
akñara : akñaraà  brahma paramam . Again, to specifically
explain the meanings of the words kñara  and akñara , Çré
Bhagavän says: sarväëi bhütäni . Only the jéva fails to act
according to his original, spiritual identity due to ignorance
since time immemorial. Being bound by his karma , he wan-
ders throughout all species of life beginning from Brahmä,
the aggregate self, down to the non-moving beings. However,
the second puruña  is akñara (infallible), and is küöa-stha , that
is, in His same infallible svarüpa , He is all-pervasive. Accord-
ing to the Amara-koña dictionary, küöa-stha  means one who
is all-pervading, who does not change His eternal svarüpa
and who remains in one form.

(2) The partial manifestation of transcendence, the ref-
uge and indwelling witness of the conscious jéva in the uni-
verse, is Paramätmä. He is also a tattva  relative only to the
universe, and is thus not an absolute tattva .

distinctly different from the previously described akñara-17! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 912

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
After explaining Paramätmä, the worshipable object of the
yogés , Çré Bhagavän describes bhagavat-tattva , the worshipable
Deity of the bhaktas.  Of the bhagavat-tattva forms,  only His
own Kåñëa svarüpa  is renowned as Puruñottama. Çré Bhagavän
speaks this çloka  beginning with the word yasmät  to explain
the term Puruñottama and His supremacy. This svarüpa -tattva ,
the reality of His form, is transcendental to the kñara  (fallible)
puruña , the jévätmä.  He is also superior to akñara-brahma , and
to the immutable,  nirvikära  Paramätmä. According to Gétä
(6.47):  yoginäm api sarveñäà / mad-gatenäntarätmanä.  He who
constantly performs My bhajana  with full faith, always think-
ing exclusively of Me within himself is, in My opinion, thetopmost of all yogés . The advancement of the sädhakas wor-
ship is established by the superiority and speciality of hisworshipable Deity. Since Çré Kåñëa is the supreme manifesta-tion of Absolute Reality, one who worships Him is the top-most yogé.  Among all supermost worshipable realities
(bhagavat -tattva ), the superiority of Svayaà Bhagavän Çré
Kåñëa is established over Vaikuëöha-nätha Näräyaëa by theword ca. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.3.28) Çré Süta Gosvämé says:
Some personalities are His portions and parts of His portions,
but Kåñëa alone is Svayaà Bhagavän. According to this state-ment of Süta Gosvämé, Kåñëa is the Supreme Reality.
Although the three words brahma , Paramätmä and
Bhagavän explain the one Transcendental Reality, who issat, cit and änanda , there is no difference in Their svarüpa ,
true constitutional nature. Also, in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(6.9.35), it is said: svarüpa-dvayäbhävät , You do not have
two svarüpas . Yet, due to the differences in sädhana and
in the results obtained by those who worship brahma ,
Paramätmä and Bhagavän, there seems to be a difference
in that one transcendental reality. Jïäna , yoga  and bhakti
are the respective means for the jïänés , yogés and bhaktas18! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 914
to attain their particular goals of brahma , Paramätmä and
Bhagavän. In fact, the result of jïäna  and yoga  is only
mokña , whereas the result of bhakti  is to become a loving
associate of Bhagavän. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.12), it is
said:  Brahma-jïäna  in the form of naiñkarmya  (freedom
from material affinity) does not appear very beautiful or
auspicious when it is bereft of bhakti  to Bhagavän. And
in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.14.5), it is said: O great person-
ality, in the past there were many yogés  in this world who
offered all their activities to Your lotus feet when they
could not achieve You by the processes of yoga and so forth.
Only then could they achieve bhakti  to You, by which they
realised Your svarüpa , and very easily attained Your supreme
abode.
From these statements, it is understood that without bhakti
one cannot attain mokña by the processes of jïäna  and yoga.
It is imperative for the worshippers of brahma  and
Paramätmä to perform bhagavad-bhakti  in order for them to
achieve perfection in the results of their respective practices .
There is no need, however, for the worshippers of Bhagavän
to worship brahma  or Paramätmä to attain perfection in their
goal. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.20.31), it is said: The pro-
cesses of jïäna  and vairägya  in this world are not considered
as the means to attain the highest perfection for a person
who is engaged in bhakti-yoga to Me. Furthermore, Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.20.32-33) states: Whatever results one at-
tains by the performance of such processes as karma , tapasyä ,
jïäna and vairägya , My bhaktas can easily attain by the
process of bhakti , be it Svarga, mokña , My Vaikuëöha-dhäma,
or whatever. A person who takes shelter of Çré Näräyaëa
achieves the four goals of human life ( dharma , artha , karma
and mokña ) without performing separate sädhanas to achieve
them.ÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !915
It is seen that by the worship of Bhagavän, one can achieve
the results of Svarga, mukti  or prema , but one cannot attain
prema by the worship of brahma  and Paramätmä. Even
though brahma  and Paramätmä do not differ from Bhagavän
on the basis of tattva , only the supremacy of Bhagavän is
being glorified here.
A flame, a lamp and a big fire are all luminous objects and
thus, non-different in nature, yet the large fire is the mosteffective in removing the miseries of those suffering from cold.And superior to the big fire is the sun. Similarly, BhagavänÇré Kåñëa is the topmost Absolute Reality. Mokña , in the form
of nirväëa , attained by perfectly worshipping brahma , is
granted by Çré Kåñëa to even those people who are envious
of Him and who are highly sinful, such as Aghäsura, Bakäsuraand Jaräsandha. Therefore, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has appro-priately commented on the statement, I am the support ofnirviçeña-brahma . Çréla Madhusüdana Sarasvaté has also
established the supremacy of Çré Kåñëa through the follow-ing statements:  Sädhakas  who want to begin their eternal
good fortune should constantly perform the bhajana  of Çré
Kåñëacandra, whose form is described in the çrutis as sac-
cid-änanda , whose complexion is the hue of fresh rainclouds,
who is the very garland of the Vraja gopés , who is the means
for intelligent people to cross over the ocean of the materialworld, and whose avatäras  perform léläs to remove the bur-
den of the earth. I do not know any other reality superior tolotus-eyed Çré Kåñëa, who has a face like a full moon, who isadorned with a flute in His hands, who wears yellow gar-ments, and whose lips are reddish like the bimba  fruit. Vari-
ous çästras give evidence of the wonderful glories of Çré Kåñëa.
Those who cannot tolerate this are fools and destined forhell. By these statements, Çréla Madhusüdana Sarasvaté has18! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  15 916
established the excellence of Çré Kåñëa. Therefore, it is im-
proper to voice ones disagreement with this explanation ofthese three Gétä çlokas  beginning from dväv imu  (15.16).
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
This subject has been described more clearly in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaà / yaj jïänam advayam
brahmeti paramätmeti / bhagavän iti çabdyate
Those who are tattva-vit call the Absolute Reality advaya-jïäna ,
non-dual knowledge. Some know that very advaya-jïäna  as
brahma , some call Him Paramätmä, and some call Him Bhagavän.
Jïänés  experience that same para-tattva  as brahma  through
their practice of jïäna -yoga.  Yogés  realise the same reality as
Paramätmä, and by bhakti-yoga , bhaktas see Him as Bhagavän.
By aiçvarya-mayé bhakti  (majestic devotion), bhaktas realise
and render service unto that para-tattva as Vaikuëöha-nätha
Näräyaëa, and by mädhurya-mayé-prema bhakti , the process
of worship in the moods of Vraja ( vraja-bhäva ), they see Him
as Svayaà Bhagavän Vrajendra-nandana Çyämasundara.Realisation of brahma , Paramätmä, and Bhagavän is not the
same. There is a gradation. By constitutional nature, water,ice and mist are one (water), although water is not called iceor mist, nor is ice called mist or water. In the same way, SvayaàBhagavän Çré Kåñëa is the pinnacle of para-tattva . The first
realisation of that para-tattva  is brahma , the second realisa-
tion is Paramätmä, and the third realisation is SvayaàBhagavän. These three perceptions are not the same. There-fore, in çästra , parabrahma is described as superior to brahma .
This has been very clearly explained in Gétä (14.27): brahmaëo
hi pratiñöhäham . I alone am the basis of that nirviçeña-
brahma.  The adjective param  before brahma  and before ätmäÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !917
establishes the superiority of parabrahma and Paramätmä over
brahma  and the ätmä respectively. But the adjective param  is
never used before the word Bhagavän. Therefore, SvayaàBhagavän alone is the topmost limit of para-tattva ; Paramätmä
and brahma  are just His two manifestations. The bodily
effulgence of Kåñëa is called brahma , and the portion of His
portion is called Paramätmä.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, The
third and topmost akñara -puruña  is called Bhagavän. I am
that very bhagavat -tattva . I am transcendental to kñara -
puruña  (the jéva), and even superior to the two other akñara-
puruñas : brahma  and Paramätmä. I am, therefore celebrated
as Puruñottama, both in this world and in the Vedas . This
siddhänta should be understood: there are two puruñas , kñara
and akñara . Akñara-puruña  has three manifestations. The
general manifestation is brahma , a higher manifestation is
Paramätmä, and the supreme manifestation is Bhagavän.

After explaining paramätmä-tattva , the worshipable ob-
ject of the yogés , Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa Himself now explains
His Puruñottama-tattva and its glories. He is well-knownas Puruñottama, being transcendental to kñara-puruña  (the
jéva), and also superior to the other two akñara-puruñas ;
brahma  and Paramätmä. He is therefore the shelter of both
the jévätmä  and of Paramätmä. This has been established
in different places in the Gétä . The supremacy of the
worshipable Deity ( upäsya ) is established by the excellence
of the worshipper ( upäsaka ). Gétä  (6.47) also states:
çraddhävän bhajate yo mäà sa me yuktatamo mataù.  Those
bhakti-yogés who engage in the bhajana  of Bhagavän with
faith are said to be superior to all types of yogés . There-
fore, the supremacy of Bhagavän, the worshipable objectÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !919
of the bhaktas , is established over the others. In Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (1.3.28) also it is said: ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù
kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam. Kåñëa is the original Person-
ality of Godhead.
Also in Çré Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  it is said that, although
from the point of view of tattva  there is no difference be-
tween the svarüpa  of Çré Näräyaëa and that of Çré Kåñëa,
from the perspective of rasa, the svarüpa of Çré Kåñëa is su-
perior.

Although in siddhänta there is no difference between Çré Kåñëa
and Çré Näräyaëa, from the point of view of rasa the form of Çré
Kåñëa is superior. This is the glory of rasa.

Çré Bhagavän is concluding this chapter with this çloka
beginning with the word iti. Çré Bhagavän says, In these
twenty çlokas , I have fully expounded the most secret doc-
trine of çästra . This chapter establishes the distinction be-
tween spirit and matter, and shows that among the three-fold manifestations of the akñara puruñas , the svarüpa of
Puruñottama puruña  Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Reality.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä ,
by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura , on the Fifteenth Chapter of
Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä , which gives pleasure to the bhaktas
and is accepted by all saintly persons.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In concluding this subject, Çré Bhagavän has said that
Puruñottama-yoga as described in this chapter, is that partof çästra  which contains the most confidential knowledge.
The import of this statement  is that no one except the bhaktas
can comprehend knowledge of this tattva . Since Arjuna is a
very dear bhakta  of Bhagavän, Çré Bhagavän is revealing
knowledge of this most confidential reality only to him. Bythe mercy of the bhaktas , the lives of those who are able to
attain knowledge of this confidential tattva  are blessed.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
sinless one, this Puruñottama-yoga is, indeed, the most con-fidential instruction in çästra . After knowing this, an intel-
ligent jéva becomes enlightened and blessed. O Bhärata, all
impurities in connection with äçraya (the abode, the jéva) and
viñaya  (the object of bhakti ) are dispelled upon understand-
ing this yoga. Bhakti  is the blissful activity of the ätmä . To
correctly execute the process of bhakti , two factors are most
necessary: the purity of the jéva who is its äçraya , and theÇLOKA PURUÑOTTAMA -YOGA !921
complete manifestation of Bhagavän, who is its viñaya . As
long as the jéva has the conception that brahma  and
Paramätmä are equal to Bhagavän ( bhagavat-tattva ), he can-
not attain the process of viçuddha-bhakti (the function of
his unalloyed existence). The process of bhakti  is executed
in its purest form only when he realises Puruñottama-tattvaas para-tattva .
During the sädhana  stage of bhakti-yoga , three great
anarthas  (unwanted things) are to be removed by the power
of sädhu-saìga and by surrendering to the limbs of çuddha-
bhajana. The jévas first weakness of heart is the desire to
enjoy mäyä  by misusing the freedom which was bestowed
upon him in his pure stage by Bhagavän. Later on, whilewandering in the material world, he developed his secondweakness of heart, which is the attachment for sense objects.Among these weaknesses of the heart, hådaya-daurbalya ,
attachment to the material world is the third anartha . All
the other anarthas  are generated from these three weaknesses
of heart.
The first five çlokas explain that pure renunciation is the
symptom that destroys the above weaknesses. Deliberationon Puruñottama-tattva along with yukta-vairägya  generated
from bhakti  is given from the sixth çloka to the end of this
chapter. This chapter describes the difference between inertmatter and spirit, and the deliberation on different mani-festations of conscious reality.

S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In the Sixteenth Chapter, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa describes
daivika  (divine) and äsurika (demonic) qualities. He alsoÇLOKA DAIVÄSURA  SAMPADA -YOGA !925 1 - 3
describes the disposition of two sorts of created beings which
correspond to these two qualities, the deva and the asura .
The first çloka  of the Fifteenth Chapter, ürdhva-mülam
adhaù-çäkham,  describes the açvattha  tree of the material
world, but does not mention its fruits. Considering this, inthe present chapter Çré Bhagavän explains the trees two typesof fruits: one which liberates and one which binds. In thefirst three çlokas, Çré Bhagavän explains the fruit that gives
mokña.
How will I maintain my life alone in a solitary forest
without my wife and family? Being free from this type offear is called fearlessness. Happiness of the citta (heart) is
called sattva-saàçuddhiù . Jïäna-yoga-vyavasthitiù  means
being steadfast in the process of acquiring knowledge, notbeing proud, for example, of ones learned status. Dänam
means offering ones own foodstuffs to others after dividingit properly. Damaù  means to control the external and
internal senses. Yajïaù  means worship of the Deity and the
devas . Svädhyäyaù  means study of the Vedas . T yägaù  means
to give up possessiveness towards wife and family. Aloluptvam
means being free from greed. The meaning of the rest of thewords is clear.
These twenty-six qualities, beginning with fearlessness,
indicate a sättvika disposition. They are attained by a person
who takes birth at a time that illuminates that sättvika nature.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The daivika  and äsurika  qualities and propensities that
were described briefly in the previous chapter are now beingexplained in detail. Being trapped in the network of mäyä,
persons of an äsurika nature take birth in various äsurika
species of life which results in misery and pain. On the other
hand, those of a daivika  nature, being endowed with divine! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  16 926
qualities, cross over the miserable ocean of birth and death,
and gradually advance on the most auspicious path throughthe process of bhagavad-bhakti. Finally they taste the bliss
of service to Bhagavän in His dhäma . Such liberated persons
never again become bound by this material world. The hostof divine qualities mentioned herein can only manifest inexalted persons who take birth at an auspicious time fromparents who have auspicious qualities, and who underwentthe garbhädhäna-saàskära, the process of conceiving progeny
according to Vedic  injunctions. This is the secret meaning
of the word abhijätasya  in the above çloka . Parents should
at least not produce children as cats and dogs do. Çré KåñëaHimself has said in the Gétä  that He is that sex life which
gives rise to good children. Therefore, sex life is not forbidden,but when it is only for sense enjoyment like that of theanimals, it is of a hellish nature.
In the varëäçrama  system, a sannyäsé  is considered to be
the foremost guru of societys four varëas  and äçramas . The
brähmaëa  is the guru of the other three varëas : kñatriya ,
vaiçya , and çüdra . Only a real sannyäsé  who possesses all divine
qualities is the guru  of the brähmaëa.
All such good qualities are visible in çuddha-bhaktas . A
surrendered sädhaka  of bhakti must be fearless and have the
firm conviction, Bhagavän is my protector and He is al-ways with me. He sees and knows everything and He sus-tains me. When a devotee develops faith like this, he re-mains completely fearless wherever he may live, in the homeor in the forest. Prahläda Mahäräja, Draupadé, the fivePäëòavas and Haridäsa Öhäkura are examples of this. ÇréHaridäsa Öhäkura remained fearless, even while beingbeaten by low-class, cruel persons in twenty-two marketplaces in Navadvépa, which was under the strict rule offanatical Muslims. After beating him, they threw him inthe Gaìgä, but he emerged from there with a healthy bodyÇLOKA DAIVÄSURA  SAMPADA -YOGA !927 1 - 3
and returned to his bhajana-kuöéra . Seeing this, the Käzé
and others became amazed. Therefore, the bhakti-sädhaka
should always be fearless.
Sattva-saàçuddhi  means the purity of the ätmä . The
conduct of the bhakti-sädhaka  is pure. The sannyäsés  and
brahmacärés  in particular, who have given up home, wife and
family, should not keep intimate relationships with women.It is forbidden for them to joke with or even talk with awoman in a solitary place. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu wasvery strict in this regard. This does not mean that He feltmalice towards women in general; He made this restrictionfor sannyäsés  and brahmacärés  who have renounced their
family lives. For men, the association of women is forbidden,and for women, the association of men is forbidden. ÇréCaitanya Mahäprabhu gave up His dear Choöa Haridäsaforever because he associated with a woman. In one sense,to look at any object with the desire to enjoy it is considered
associating with women ( stré-saìga ). Kåñëa is the Supreme
Enjoyer of everyone, and everyone is meant for Hisenjoyment. A sädhaka should always remain pure and
consider himself to be Kåñëa däsa.
To remain engaged in the cultivation of tattva-jïäna is
called jïäna-yoga -vyavasthitiù . Saìkértana-yajïa  has been
accepted as the foremost of all yajïas . Hiàsä  means vio-
lence to the jéva. To not cause pain to any jéva, either by
body, mind or words is ahiàsä. Specifically, one should not
be violent to animals. It is violence to block any jévas
progress to the higher levels of consciousness. When anembodied being experiences an untimely death, he has totake birth again in the same species of life and, after com-pleting his remaining period in that body, he enters anotherspecies. One should not stop the progress of any living en-tity for the satisfacton of the tongue or any other selfishpurpose. This is non-violence.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  16 928
The twenty-six qualities described above are called daivika .
By developing these qualities, one can gradually reach thehighest platform of self-realisation.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura writes, Now, Arjuna may
doubt the validity of various statements of çästra that one
should attain jïäna  while cultivating sättvika qualities. To
dispel this doubt Çré Bhagavän says, The açvattha  tree in the
form of the material world has two fruits. One fruit stronglybinds the jéva to the material world, and the other gives
liberation from it. Sattva-saàçuddhi,  the purification of ones
existence, is the only fearless path for the jéva. The jévas  very
existence is composed of çuddha-sattva , but in the bound state
his çuddha-sättvika nature is dominated by the three guëas.
All çästras indicate that the cultivation of jïäna-yoga puri-
fies ones existence. Sattva-guëa is conducive for the culti-
vation of knowledge which leads to liberation. All thesequalities are a divine opulence ( daivé-sampad ) and assist the
jéva in realizing his pure existence. That which blocks the
jévas sattva-saàçuddhi  is called äsuré-sampad  (demonic
qualities). Fearlessness, purity of existence ( sattva-saàçuddhi ),
jïäna-yoga, charity, control of the senses, yajïa , penance,
simplicity, study of the Vedas , non-violence, truthfulness, lack
of anger, renunciation, peacefulness, giving up criticism ofothers, kindness, absence of greed, gentility, shyness, lack offickleness, vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness and lackof envy and pride are the twenty-six qualities called daivé-
sampad . If one takes birth at an auspicious moment, he

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Now Çré Bhagavän is explaining the fruits that bind one
to material existence. To pose as a religious person while beingirreligious is called dambha,  hypocritical. Pride in wealth and
education is called darpaù, or arrogance. Desire to be respected
by others and attachment to wife and family is calledabhimänaù, conceit. The meaning of the word krodha ( anger)
is clear. Päruñyam  means being hard-hearted. Ajïänam
means lack of discrimination. Äsuré-sampad also indicates
räkñasé-sampad.  One who takes birth at a time that gives rise
to räjasika  and tämasika  qualities receives such qualities
accordingly.

Those who are born at an extremely inauspicious time,
having not undergone auspicious purificatory rites(saàskäras ), have an äsurika  nature. It is people of such a
nature who make a show of religion and advancement inspiritual life. Thus, they cheat simple and innocent people.They consider that acquiring wealth, women and prestige isthe perfection of life. They do not follow the instructions of! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  16 930
çästra , yet they have great pride. They become angry over
petty matters. There is not a scent of humility in them. Theyare hard-hearted and devoid of discrimination. All thesequalities are äsurika.  One should always remain at a distance
from such qualities.

ones existence). You are blessed with daivé-sampad  (divine

Çré Bhagavän is describing the philosophy of the asuras .
They say that the material world is asatyam, unreal, and a
result of illusion. That which has no basis is called apratiñöha .
They say that just as a flower in the sky has no basis, in thesame way this material world has no basis. Anéçvaram  means
that since the world is unreal, it has not been created byÉçvara; rather, it has come about accidentally without anymutual union, like living entities born from perspiration. Not! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  16 934
only this, they say that this world is only the result of käma ,
the selfish desire of the creator, if there is one. Since theyclaim that this world is unreal, they feel that they have li-cence to give speculative explanations about it. Furthermore,some say that the evidence given in the Vedas  and Puräëas
is false. The asuras say: trayo vedasya karttäro muni-bhaëòa-
niçäcaräù. Thinkers, jesters and demons who are selfish and
whose views differ, have composed the Vedas .
Apratiñöha  means that dharma  and adharma are not
defined in the Vedas  and that they are the result of illusion.
Anéçvaram  means that even Éçvara has been concocted as a
result of illusion. If somebody says that this material worldseems to manifest from the union of male and female, thenin response the asuras say, aparaspara-sambütam , there is no
such cause and effect behind it, and that the birth of a childfrom parents is also an illusion. They say that when a pottermakes a pot from mud, he knows what he is doing, but when
parents procreate a child, they do not know how it happens,
therefore, the process of begetting a child is also illusion. OArjuna, what more can I say? Asuras  say that the only cause
of the universe is selfish desire. According to their logic, atoms,mäyä,  Éçvara, or whatever are the cause behind the creation
of the world.

In the present çloka,  Çré Bhagavän is explaining the
philosophy of those who possess an äsurika  nature. The
essence of Çré Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëas commentary on thisçloka  is as follows:
1) According to the opinion of the mäyävädés, this material
world is asatya , apratiñöhita  and anéçvara . They say it is asatya
because it is an illusion, just as a rope can be taken for a snake;
apratiñöhita  because it has no basis, like a flower in the sky,ÇLOKA DAIVÄSURA  SAMPADA -YOGA !935 8
and anéçvara,  because Éçvara is not the cause behind creation.
2) According to the svabhäva-vädé Buddhists, the material
world is aparaspara-sambütam , that is, not born of mutual
union between male and female, but comes from svabhäva,
and that the natural and necessary action of substancesaccording to their inherent properties produce and sustainthe universe.
3) According to Cärväka, this material world is käma-
haitukam , born from the flow of lust between male and
female.
4) According to the Jains, käma  (selfish desire) is the cause
of this world. On the basis of their speculative logic, theydisregard the authoritative Vedic  literatures and engage in
useless endeavour to ascertain the cause of this materialworld.
Çré Kåñëas statement, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-
caräcaram  (Gétä  9.10), very clearly explains that this entire
material world, consisting of moving and non-moving beings,
has been created by prakåti  under His supervision. Since this
world has been created by the will of satya-saìkalpa
Bhagavän (He whose desires must come to pass), this worldis also real, but changeable and perishable. The asuras
imagine various types of temporary atheistic conclusionsbecause they are bereft of pure and perfect wisdom.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, Those of an äsurika
temperament call this world asatya , apratiñöhita  and anéçvara .
Their philosophy is that there is no purpose in accepting theexistence of Éçvara, since the relationship of cause and ef-fect is not the basis of the creation of the universe. Some saythat Éçvara does exist, but, when He created the world, Hewas influenced by His selfish desires, therefore He is notqualified to be the object of our worship.!

compassion, bestow that rare mukti  attained in the matured stage
of bhakti-miçra-jïäna  (jïäna  mixed with  bhakti ), even to sin-
ners such as Kaàsa. It is said in the prayers of the Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (10.87.23): O Prabhu! Simply by constantly thinking
of You, even Your enemies have attained the same SupremeAbsolute Reality as the munis  who are fixed in yoga and who
worship You by controlling their breath, mind and senses. There-fore, My supremacy, as described earlier, is established. This isalso found in a çloka  from the Laghu-Bhägavatämåta, which
states that, as long as those who envy Kåñëa do not attain Him,they remain in a degraded species of life. This is very clear.

In the nineteenth çloka,  Çré Kåñëa said that He throws
people who are envious of sädhus , who are cruel and the most
degraded of human beings, into a miserable äsurika  species
of life. From this statement, someone may question suchbehaviour of Bhagavän, saying that it is not equanimous butan indication of partiality. However, although Ésvara is ableto do anything and everything, karttum akarttum anyathä
karttum samarthaù  (The Lord is able to do or undo anything
He wishes), usually the jéva only gets the result of his own
karma (action). Therefore, in order to undergo the result of
their own karma , sinful people who are opposed to the Vedas ,
bhaktas and Bhagavän again and again enter the äsurika
species of life. Due to repeated demonic births, they do notget a chance to become free from their offences. If theoffences and sins that are committed in human life are notatoned for in human life, a person does not get the chanceto clear them when he goes to lower species, such as birdsand beasts. A birth in all species, except the human species,
is only meant for reaping the results of past karma  (bhoga-
yoni). In this regard, Çréla Madhusüdana Sarasvaté writes:! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  16 946
ihaiva naraka-vyädheç cikitsäà na karoti yaù

If a person cannot cure the disease of sinking to hellish life while
living in this human body, what will he do when he goes wherethere is no remedy, namely, a lower species of life?
Éçvara is never partial. This was explained in detail ear-
lier. Here, one should note that those such as Hiraëyakaçipu,Hiraëyäkña, Rävaëa, Kumbhakarëa, Çiçupäla andDantavakra took birth in kñatriya  dynasties because they were
cursed to do so, and directly opposed Bhagaväns avatäras  such
as Çré Nåsiàha, Çré Varäha, Çré Räma and Çré Kåñëa, con-sidering Them to be their enemies. But because they werekilled by these avatäras, they attained a virtuous destination
and gave up their äsurika  life. Those who were killed by Çré
Kåñëa specifically attained the highest destination.Furthermore, it should be noted that they all had faith inthe Vedas  and Vedic  activities, and had performed Vedic
yajïas.  They indirectly believed in a supreme controller, käla-
çakti  (the potency of time), and in the Supreme Lord.
The supremacy of Çré Kåñëa, the glory of His supreme
tattva  and His specific quality of bestowing mukti  upon those
whom He kills is  established by studying these avatäras .
When the asuras who are envious of Bhagavän are killed
by avatäras other than Kåñëa Himself, they attain immense
enjoyment in Svarga and other places, or birth in a highfamily. But when they are killed by Çré Kåñëa Himself, whois the source of all avatäras , they attain mukti : särüpya ,
sälokya , särñöi or sämépya.  They may even attain service to
Bhagavän as one of His associates. Therefore, Çré Kåñëaalone is said to be the fountainhead of all avatäras : ete cäàça-
kalä puàsaù kåñëas tu bhagavän svayaà  (Çrémad-
Bhägavatam 1.3.28). All the avatäras mentioned are eitherÇLOKA DAIVÄSURA  SAMPADA -YOGA !947 21
plenary portions, or portions of the plenary portions of
Svayam Bhagavän, the original Personality of Godhead.Kåñëa even gave Pütanä the position of acting as a nurseto Him. When He descended in the form of Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu, He even bestowed bhagavat-prema  on Jagäi,
Madhäi and the Chänd Käzé.
In the phrase  mäm apräpyaiva,  Kåñëa Himself is express-
ing this deep secret by the word eva, which means certainly.
It is certain that as long as a person does not attain Me,Kåñëa (or the path which leads to Me), there is no chanceof him being completely liberated from miserable  material
life.

The äsurika  qualities described above are both self-destruc-
tive and the gateways to hell. Three of these qualitieslust,anger and greedare the root of all other äsurika  qualities.
Therefore, every human being who desires his own welfareshould give them up completely. Despite their variousendeavours, it is not even possible for the karmés , jïänés  or
yogés to control these tendencies, but a çuddha-bhakta,  by the
influence of sädhu-saìga , easily engages these three enemies
in the service of Çré Hari, and displays an extraordinary ex-ample of controlling them.

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, Becoming free from

purification , one attains kåñëa-bhakti,  the supreme desti-
nation. The jéva can only attain a fearless position as a
result of his purified existence (freedom from material bond-age) when there is a proper relationship between pure work(karma ) and pure knowledge as a means and an end, as
described in çästra.  This is how mukti functions as a maid-

Having learned the injunctions of çästra,  it is proper for those
who desire eternal auspiciousness to cultivate bhakti  to Çré Hari
under the guidance of the guru-varga , according to their respec-
tive adhikära . It is not spiritually favourable for an intelligent
person to act against the codes of çästra , and consider as au-
thoritative the imaginary ideas of so-called instructors who areglorified by non-devotees. Only the çrutis  are authoritative in
verifying what is correct or incorrect behaviour, because theyare apauruñeyä  (not composed by any human being), and are
free from the four defects such as bhrama  (illusion) and pramäda
(negligence). The instructions of a person who has the fourdefects, of illusion, negligence, imperfect senses and the desireto cheat others are not authoritative.
Special Instruction: The root offence of the jéva is the
misuse of his free will, and his subsequent aversion to theservice of Çré Bhagavän. Therefore, mäyä , who is like a
maidservant of Bhagavän, causes the  jévas  bondage. Being
bound by mäyä,  the jéva gives up that sättvika nature which
enables him to understand Bhagavän. Thus, by acceptingtämasika  qualities, the jéva becomes äsurika . At that time,
many offences manifest, such as criticising sädhus ; main-
taining the conception that there are many gods, or thatthere is no God; disobeying the guru ; disregarding the çästra ;
thinking that the glory of bhakti as described in çästra  is
false; proposing that karma  and jïäna  are bhakti ; not hav-
ing faith in  bhakti ; and instructing  bhakti  to unqualified
people.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  16 952
This chapter teaches that, after giving up this äsurika
nature, it is obligatory to engage in the practice of the ninetypes of  bhakti  with faith, following the principles described
in çästra .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Therefore, only çästra is authoritative in determining cor-
rect and incorrect behaviour. The conclusion of çästra  is that
one should perform bhakti . Knowing this, you will become
qualified to lead an active devotional life. Theists attain thesupreme destination by having faith in Bhagavän, and thefaithless atheist goes to hell. This is the meaning of thischapter.

A jévas  inherent asset is the çraddhä  or rati he has in his
çuddha-svarüpa  (constitutional position). That inherent
çraddhä  in his svarüpa  is related to Bhagavän only, and is
unquestionably nirguëa.  However, in the bound state, the
constitutional nature of the jéva becomes distorted. When the
jéva associates with prakåti , the result is that he performs
either auspicious or inauspicious activities. That distortedfaith, known as sättvika , räjasika  or tämasika , corresponds
to whichever worshipable deity his faith is directed toward.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O
Bhärata, everyone has faith. A person expresses his faithaccording to the disposition of his mind, and his nature de-velops according to the nature of the deity he has placed hisfaith in. The reality is that because the jéva is constitution-
ally My aàça  (part), he is therefore, nirguëa.  That jéva who
has forgotten his relationship with Me has become saguëa
(bound by the  guëas ). He has acquired that saguëa nature
as a result of his aversion to Me since time immemorial. It isthis aversion which forms the nature or disposition of his citta

fearlessness results. The faith of the purified citta is the seed
of nirguëa-bhakti.  The faith of the impure heart is saguëa ,

räjasika and tämasika . Those who have sättvika çraddhä
worship devas such as Brahmä, Çiva, Indra, Candra and
Sürya. Similarly, those whose çraddhä  is räjasika worship
Durgä, yakñas , räkñasas  and so on, and those who possess
tämasika çraddhä  worship ghosts and spirits. Sometimes it
is seen that the three types of people in the three differentmodes worship the same deva . For example, Märkaëòeya
Åñis worship of Lord Çiva at the time of devastation wassättvika.  Kägabhuñuëòijés worship of Çiva was also sättvika.
As a result of their sättvika  worship, Märkaëòeya Åñi re-
mained alive for one kalpa  and acquired knowledge of the
creation of the universe, etc., and Kägabhuñuëòi attainedbhakti  unto Bhagavän Çré Rämacandra. The worship of
Lord Çiva performed by Bäëäsura and Rävaëa, etc., isräjasika , and the worship by Bhasmäsura,  etc., is tämasika .
Durgä devé is also worshipped by those with sättvika , räjasika
or tämasika çraddhä . However, by the influence of saintly
association,  tämasika çraddhä  can be transformed into
räjasika çraddhä , räjasika  into sättvika  and sättvika  into
nirguëa çraddhä .
The çraddhä  of nirviçeña-vädés  is also sättvika . They con-
sider brahma  to be formless and featureless. Therefore, they
accept the forms of five devatas  to be imaginary and wor-
ship them. In this way, they endeavour to purify their citta
and attain jïäna .

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Kåñëa said, O Arjuna! You have asked about the status of
those who discard the injunctions of çästra , yet perform
worship endowed with çraddhä ; are they sättvika , räjasika  or
tämasika ? Now hear My reply in the two çlokas  beginning
with the word açästra . Faith and the  renunciation of selfish
desires are visible in those who perform severe, tortuous aus-terities, which create fear within all living beings, and other
acts such as unauthorised japa-yajïa , but such people areÇLOKA ÇRADDHÄ -TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !961 5 - 6
bereft of tattva-jïäna . Those who are proud and egotistical
will surely violate the rules of çästra . Käma  refers to desires
such as remaining young forever, being immortal and desir-ing a kingdom. Räga  means attachment to ones austerities,
and bala means the capacity to perform austerities like
Hiraëyakaçipu. From the very beginning of their austerities,such persons torture the bhüta-grämaà  (group of elements
such as earth) which are situated in the body, and causeunnecessary pain to Me as well as to My aàça , the jéva. Such
persons have äsurika  dispositions.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Here Çré Kåñëa is telling Arjuna that those who disregard
çästra  and perform severe austerities, such as fasting to ful-
fil their material desires, are not included amongst thosewho perform the sättvika , räjasika  and tämasika  activities
explained previously. Such people are very unfortunate.Being influenced by the association of pretenders, theyperform severe austerities which intimidate common people,and which are not recommended in the çästra.  Austerities
such as worthless, painful fasts, offering ones body or fleshin yajïa , offering a human being in yajïa  (nara-bali ), of-
fering animals in yajïa (paçu-bali ) and other such violent
acts cause pain to ones self ( ätmä) and also to Paramätmä.
Such people who possess a cruel nature should be consid-ered äsurika . At the present time, some people observe fasts
which are not recommended in çästra  out of selfish or po-
litical interests. The provision for fasts given in the çästra
is only for the purpose of attaining the transcendental goal,and not for political or social purposes. On ekädaçé , there
is a provision to fast from everything, even from water
(nirjala-vrata) , and to remain awake performing hari-
kértana  throughout the night ( rätri-jägaraëa ). Nowadays,
people perform rätri-jägaraëa by eating flesh, drinking wine! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  17 962
and singing vulgar and contemptible songs. In this way, they
violate the rules of çästra . Such rätri-jägaraëa  is not in-
cluded within the three types of çraddhä , and is miserable.
These fasts and jägaraëas  do not benefit anyone. In fact,
such activities are performed out of the pride and ego bornfrom excessive attachment to material desires and senseenjoyment. They also cause unnecessary pain to the bodyand disturb ones inner peace as well as the peace of others.Sometimes persons even die from performing these fanati-cal austerities and fasts. While wandering repeatedly in theäsurika  species of life, they receive only misery. But, if  by
the will of providence, they receive the association of açuddha-bhakta , they can receive some benefit. Examples of
this are Nalaküvera and Maëigréva.

Those who discard the injunctions of çästra  and act whim-
sically enter the äsurika  species of life. This was mentioned
in the previous chapter. Those of an äsurika  nature who
worship yakñas , räkñasas and spirits, also enter the äsurika
species of life as stated in this chapter. One can categorisepeople as divine or demoniac according to the type of foodthey eat. This will be explained in thirteen consecutive çlokas
beginning here with the words ähäras tu.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Having explained the three categories of çraddhä ,
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa describes specific food, yajïas  and so
forth corresponding to each of them. Those who are of aparticular mode are inclined to food, sacrifices, austeritiesand charities in the same mode. Nowadays, some peopleimagine that food has no relationship with dharma , while
others think  that protecting and maintaining the body is
the basis of all dharma : çaréram ädyaà khalu dharma
sädhanam.  Hence, one should note that those who accept
sense enjoyment as the only purpose of human life feel greatsatisfaction in drinking wine and eating meat, eggs and evencow-flesh. Fortunately, some people have understood thatthe tendency for sense enjoyment has caused the  jévas
bondage to mäyä , and because of it they are undergoing so
much misery, life after life. For those who want to becomefree from all miseries, it is imperative that they give up theirdesire to indulge in sense enjoyment. Only people who havedeveloped such awareness in this human life understand theneed to accept pure, sättvika  food. In order to cross beyond
the three guëas of mäyä , they first try to overcome tamo-
guëa  with rajo-guëa , then rajo-guëa  with sattva-guëa , and
finally mundane sattva-guëa  with nirguëa  (çuddha-sattva ).! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  17 964
Sädhu  and çästra  state that control of the mind is indeed
the root of all  dharma . The bodys nearest relative is the
mind, and thus ones inclination of mind becomes good orbad depending on the type of food one takes. This is visibleeverywhere. Most people in the world today consume ined-ible and äsurika foodstuffs and indulge in acts of illicit sex,
cheating, duplicity and violence. At present, proper moralconduct ( sad-äcära ) is rarely seen. Therefore, after careful
consideration, those who are wise should only accept suchfoodstuffs which nourish the body and the function of thepure intelligence. For this reason, Çré Bhagavän has de-scribed the three types of foodstuffs which represent thethree modes. Those who aim to adopt sattva-guëa , are seen
to become disinterested in räjasika  and tämasika  food and
interested in sättvika  foods only.
While commenting on this çloka , Çré Rämänujäcärya has
cited two evidences from çruti.  1) Annamayam hi saumya-
manaù.  One who eats grains will have a peaceful mind. 2)
Ähära-çuddhau sattva-çuddhiù . If ones food is pure, then
ones existence becomes purified. The çrutis  have also cau-
tioned us that the purity of the mind depends upon the pu-rity of the food. This can be easily understood by these proofs.We must, therefore, give up all food which çästra  prohibits.
Çré Kåñëa Himself has explained this very clearly in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.25.28):
pathyaà pütam anäyas tam / ähäryaà sättvikaà småtam
räjasaà cendriya-preñöhaà / tämasaà cärtti-däçuci
Food which is wholesome, pure and obtained without difficulty
is sättvika . That which is very pungent, sour and salty and meant
only for the gratification of the senses is räjasika , and food which
is impure is tämasika. But that food which is approved of by çästra
and offered to Me is nirguëa .ÇLOKA ÇRADDHÄ -TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !965 8
From the word ca in this çloka  (11.25.28), both Çréla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura and Çréla Çrédhara Sväméhave concluded that food which is offered to Bhagavän isnirguëa.  Those who violate these instructions and accept any
type of impure food based on their fancy must be in theäsurika  class.

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
In this world, it is a well-known fact that by eating sättvika
food, ones duration of life increases. The word sattvam  means
enthusiasm. Rasyä refers to substances like guòa  (gur) which
although tasty ( rasyä ) are dry. Çré Bhagavän then refers to
foods like milk and cream, which are both tasty  (rasyä ) and! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  17 966
fatty  (snigdhä ) but not solid ( sthiräù ). He then refers to foods
that are rasyä , snigdhä  and sthiräù , such as jackfruit. Although
jackfruit fits into the above categories, it is not good for theheart and stomach; therefore, Çré Bhagavän specificallymentions food that is beneficial for the heart as well as thebelly. Cow products like milk and yogurt, as well as wheat,sugar and rice have the characteristics of sattva  and are liked
by sättvika  people. This should be understood. Sättvika  people
do not like impure food, even if it has the above-mentionedcharacteristics, so the adjective pavitra  (pure) applies to this
çloka.  In Gétä (17.10), the adjective amedhya  (impure) is used
for people who like food in tamo-guëa .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the present çloka , Çré Bhagavän is informing Arjuna
that according to the grade of foodstuffs consumed, thereis a corresponding guëa . Generally, a person who desires his
own welfare accepts only sättvika  food. Sättvika  food is
favourable for the execution of dharma  because it is pure.
It is not only good for the health but it increases the dura-tion of life. Such pure food is auspicious in every respect asit purifies the body and mind. It is easy to distinguish thedifference between the effect on the mind of drinking milkand that of drinking wine. People are giving up takingsättvika  food due to bad association, improper knowledge
and lack of proper saàskäras.

very spicy and very pungent (like radish), spices such as black

burning (like roasted black gram ) are the cause of pain, dis-
ease and grief. Here, the word duùkha  (pain) refers to the in-
stant misery caused to the eyes, throat and so forth whileeating, and the word çoka (grief) refers to the anxiety about
reactions to come. The word ämaya  means disease.

One immediately gets a burning sensation in the tongue,

indigestion follow. Later, the mind becomes restless due tounpleasant thoughts and anxiety, and various types of diseasesdevelop. In this way, life becomes miserable. Aside from this,the mind becomes distracted from  dharmika activities and
disinterested in them as a result of eating these räjasika food-
stuffs. People of a sättvika  nature, therefore, do not accept

Amedhya  means that which is not fit to be consumed, like
meat or tobacco. Therefore, those who are concerned abouttheir own welfare should eat only sättvika  food. Vaiñëavas,
however, should not even accept sättvika  food if it is not
offered to Bhagavän. It is understood from Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  that food which is offered to Bhagavän is
nirguëa.  This alone is dear to the bhaktas .ÇLOKA ÇRADDHÄ -TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !969 10
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The purpose of food is to keep the body healthy and strong,
make the mind pure, increase the lifespan and engage a per-
son in his spiritual welfare. In ancient times, those who were
learned and wise would accept only food that kept themhealthy and increased their life span. Milk, yogurt, sugar, rice,wheat, fruit and vegetables are dear to sättvika  people.
Many people think that there is no harm in eating foods
such as meat and wine that they have offered in their wor-ship of the devatäs . Although çästra  makes provision for such
acts, people do not perform them in accordance with theseprovisions.  The provision in çästra for killing animals or
drinking wine in yajïa  is actually for extremely tämasika
people who are completely attached to sense indulgence. Itis a temporary arrangement to expertly bring them to theplatform of abstention from such acts. This is also confirmedin Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.5.11):
loke vyaväyämiña-madya-sevä
nityä hi jantor na hi tatra codanä
vyavasthitis teñu viväha-yajïa
surä-grahair äsu nivåttir iñöä
It is seen that people in the material world have a natural incli-
nation towards drinking wine, eating meat and having sex. Yetçästra  never encourages these activities. To some extent, provi-
sion has been granted for sex-life within a sanctified marriage,and for eating meat and drinking wine in a yajïa called
çauträmaëi . The purpose is to control such peoples unrestrained
natures, and fix them within the boundary of morality. The ac-tual, deep import of the Vedas  is to encourage people to com-
pletely give up these activities.
Furthermore, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.5.13) says:
yad ghräëa-bhakño vihitaù suräyäs! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  17 970
tathä paçor älabhanaà na hiàsä
Çästra  ordains the smelling of wine at the time of a yajïa , but not
the drinking of it, and only for the above-mentioned purpose ofgradually attaining complete renunciation. In the same way, çästra
does not authorise anyone to kill an animal and eat meat. It per-mits one to touch the animal only and then release it.
 Some people think that, although it is sinful to eat meat,
no sin is incurred in eating fish because fish are like the flowersor fruits of the water. However, Manu-saàhitä  completely
forbids the eating of fish:
yo yasya mäàsam açnäti / sa tan-mäàsäd ucyate
matsyädaù sarva-mäàsädas / tasmän matsyän vivarjayet
Those who eat the meat of a particular animal are known as
eaters of that particular animal, but those who eat fish eat themeat of everything, because a fish eats the meat of all livingentities such as cows and pigs. It even consumes rotten things.Those who eat fish actually eat the meat of all beings.
 Eating fish should, therefore, be abandoned entirely.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.5.14) further states:
ye tv anevaà-vido santaù / stabdhäù sad-abhimäninaù
paçün druhyanti visrabdhäù / pretya khädanti te ca tän
Intoxicated by their false ego, those who are ignorant of dharmika
principles are not perceptive. Such tämasika  people who fear-
lessly eat animals after killing them will be eaten by those sameanimals in their next life.
Regarding the meaning of the word mäàsa  (meat), Manu-
saàhitä  says:
mäà sa bhakñayitämutra / yasya mäàsam ihädmy aham
etan mäàsasya mäàsatvaà / pravadanti manéñiëaù
The word mäàsa means:  That which I am eating here, will eatÇLOKA ÇRADDHÄ -TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !971 11
me in my next life. For this reason, the learned say that meat is
called mäàsa (a repeated act: I eat him; he eats me).
Here it should also be understood that eating sättvika  food
enhances ones sattva , goodness. But even this mode is not com-
pletely free from sin, because there is also life in creepers, veg-etables, plants and trees. A touch of sin also remains in the prepa-ration of vegetarian food because, to some degree, it involves vio-lence. For this reason, çuddha-bhaktas accept only food which
has been offered to Bhagavän ( mahäprasäda ). Mahäprasäda  is
the only food fit to be eaten, because it is nirguëa  and completely
free from sin. Food that has not been offered should be shunnedtotally. This is also written in the Brahma-vaivarta  and the Padma
Puräëa : annaà viñtùä jalaà mütraà yad viñëor anivedanam.
Taking food and water which is not offered to Çré Viñëu is com-pared to eating stool and drinking urine.

duty and without expectation of any reward to a person who
is selfless and who never performs activities for his ownwelfare, or who does not have the ability to perform welfarefor others. In this regard, it is also necessary to consider theproper time, place, and person.

It is said that oà, tat and sat are the three words
used to indicate brahma , the Supreme Absolute Real-
ity. Brähmaëas , the Vedas  and yajïas were originally
created from these three words. Therefore, dedicatedfollowers of the 
Vedas  always commence the perfor-
mance of sacrifices, charities, austerities and activi-ties prescribed in 
çästra  by uttering the sacred syl-
lable oà.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
It is generally explained that every human being can per-
form one of the three types of yajïa , tapasyä , etc., according
to his adhikära . Those who are sättvika and those who are
brahma-vädés , begin their performance of yajïa with an
invocation to brahma . Therefore, Çré Bhagavän says that the
sädhus  remember and honour Him by the threefold invoca-
tion of brahma : oà, tat, sat. The renowned sacred syllable
oà is prominent amongst these invocations in all the Vedas ,ÇLOKA ÇRADDHÄ -TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !981 24
and is certainly the name of brahma . Ta t (brahma ) is well
known as the cause of the universe and it also removes atat
(mäyä ). Sat is described in the çruti (Chändogya Upaniñad
6.2.1) as follows: O gentle one, in the beginning there wasonly sat (The Supreme Absolute Eternal Reality). The
brähmaëas , Vedas  and a host of yajïas  were created solely
from brahma  who is represented by the names oà, tat and
sat. Consequently, the current followers of the Vedas  per-
form yajïas by uttering the sacred syllable oà.
S

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, Please
listen as I explain the import of these çlokas . T apasyä , yajïa ,
däna and food are each of three types: sättvika , räjasika  and
tämasika.  The faith with which the conditioned jévas per-
form these activities may be first, second or third class, butit remains contaminated by the modes and is worthless. Theseactivities only become purposeful in attaining the stage offearlessness (the purification of sattva , existence) when they
are performed with nirguëa -çraddhä , that is, with that
çraddhä  which gives rise to bhakti.  It is ordained throughout
çästra  that prescribed duties should be performed with such
transcendental çraddhä . In çästra  there are three principles
which indicate brahma : oà, tat and sat. These three names,
which are indicative of brahma , also describe the brähmaëas ,
the Vedas  and yajïas . Çraddhä  in which one neglects the codes
of çästra  is saguëa (contaminated by the modes). It does not
aim at nirguëa-brahma in any way and will only give a mate-
rial result. Therefore, the essence of çästra  is transcen dental
çraddhä . Your doubt about çästra  and çraddhä  is born of ig-
norance. Followers of the Vedas  perform all their activities
as prescribed in çästra , such as yajïa , tapasyä  and däna , by
chanting the sacred syllable oà which indicates brahma .! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  17 982

O Pärtha! The word sat (eternality) refers to the

brahma. In the same way, the word sat is also used in
connection with auspicious acts.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
The word sat represents brahma , and is used in auspicious
or praiseworthy acts. It can also be used in all auspicious actswhich are material as well as transcendental. Çré Bhagavänis speaking these two çlokas , the first beginning with the word
sad-bhäve to explain this. Sad-bhäve (having the nature of
eternal reality) is an appropriate meaning for brahmatva
(spiritual quality) and brahmaväditva  (worshippers of
brahma ).
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The sacred syllable  oà is the name of para-tattva brahma .
He is also called tat. In the same way, the word sat indicates
that He exists eternally and that He is the cause of every-thing. He alone is sad-vastu , or the real entity. This is also
stated in the Vedas : sad eva saumya idam agra äséta. O gentle
one, previously this material world existed in the form of sat,
one without a second, and before the creation there was onlysat (Chändogya Upaniñad  6.2.1). Sädhus  are those in whose25-26! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  17 984
hearts only this sat exists. It is also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(3.25.25): satäà prasaìgän . Here also the word sat is used for
those bhaktas  of Çré Bhagavän who have realised the Absolute
Truth. In general, auspicious acts in this material world are alsoknown as sat-kärya , blessed acts. In Sat-kriyä-sära-dépikä , Çréla
Gopäla Bhaööa Gosvämé, a prominent Gauòéya VaiñëavaÄcärya  and the protector of Gauòéya Vaiñëava conceptions,
defines sat as follows: The one-pointed bhaktas  of Çré Govinda
are devoted to sat thoughts. Since all their activities are per-
formed for the pleasure of Bhagavän, their activities are calledsat. All other activities are asat, and are forbidden.
In this regard, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa is explaining the mean-
ing of the word sat in these two çlokas , the first beginning
with the word sad-bhäve.  O Pärtha, the word sat is used for
sad-bhäva  (that which aims at brahma ) and sädhu-bhäva
(the supremely virtuous nature and activities of the one-pointed surrendered bhaktas  of Kåñëa). In the same way, the
word sat is also used for auspicious acts.
The word sat is used for brahma . Vrajendra-nandana Çré
Kåñëa who is omnipotent, the cause of all causes and thesupport and basis of all rasa, is Himself the complete sat
entity. The word sat is also used for His associates, His dhämas ,
all His avatäras , the dhämas  of those avatäras , His aikäntika-
bhaktas , the presiding Deity of the gäyatré-mantra ,
brähmaëas , bhakti  and so forth. It is also used for Çré
Bhagaväns näma , guëa , rüpa , lélä, etc. Oà tat sat  is uttered
while giving dékñä  to a faithful person, or while giving him
the sacred thread. Çré Gurudeva who bestows the gäyatré-man-
tra and hari-näma  is also called sat (sad-guru ). The disciple
who accepts these mantras  is called sat-çiñya , and the pro-
cess of dékñä  is called sat (sad-anuñöhäna) , meaning spiritual
rite or ceremony. In this way, çästra  approves the use of the
word sat in all objects, services, activities and manifestationsÇLOKA ÇRADDHÄ -TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !985

I have heard about sat-karma , but what is asat-karma ?
Expecting this question from Arjuna, Çré Bhagavän is speak-ing this çloka  beginning with the word açraddhayä . All fire
yajïas (hutam ), charity ( dattam ), penances ( tapaù) , and any-
thing else which is done without çraddhä , is asat. This means
that although yajïa  may be performed, it is not actually a
yajïa ; charity may be given, but it is not charity; tapasyä may
be performed, but it is not tapasyä , and whatever else may be
done is in fact useless, if performed without faith. It does noteven give good results in this world, what to speak of it fruc-tifying in the other world:  tat na pretya no iha .ÇLOKA ÇRADDHÄ -TRAYA -VIBHÄGA -YOGA !987
Various types of prescribed activities that are performed
with sättvika çraddhä  lead to mokña . This is explained in the
present chapter.
Thus ends the Bhävänuväda of the Särärtha-Varñiëé Öékä ,
by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura , on the Seventeenth Chapter
of Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä , which gives pleasure to the bhaktas

Bhagavän, guru and Vaiñëavas, such as collecting alms, dig-

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, O

performed without nirguëa -çraddhä  are asat (temporary and

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
This chapter describes the following subjects: the three
types of sannyäsa , jïäna  and karma , the conclusive under-
standing of mukti ,  and the most confidential essence of
bhakti.
In the previous chapter, Çré Bhagavän said, After becom-
ing free from all material desires, those who seek mokña  per-
form various types of yajïa , give in charity and engage in
penances while uttering the word tat (Gétä  17.25). Çré
Bhagavän uses the word mokña-käìkñé  (a seeker of mokña )
in this statement to indicate the sannyäsé  only. But, if this
word refers to someone other than the sannyäsé , then who
is that person? Çré Bhagavän says in Gétä  (12.11): sarva-
karma-phala-tyägaà  tataù  kuru  yatätmavän. Being situated
in the self, you should engage in your prescribed duties, re-nouncing the fruits of action. Arjuna is now inquiring, Thewords sarva-karma-phala-tyägam  (in Gétä  12.11), refer to
tyäga (renunciation) . I wish to know about the symptoms
of a tyägé (renunciant). I also want to know about the symp-
toms of sannyäsa (the renounced order of life) that are found
in sannyäsés (those who have formally taken the renounced
order) . Arjuna is inquisitive and intelligent, and he spoke
this çloka  beginning with sannyäsasya  in order to under-
stand these topics clearly. Arjuna has used the word påthak
to mean, If sannyäsa  and tyäga  have different meanings,
then I wish to know their true separate natures. Even if theyhave the same meaning in Your opinion, or in the opinionof others, I still wish to understand the difference betweenthe two. O Håñékeça, You alone are the prompter of my in-telligence, therefore, this doubt has arisen only by Yourinspiration. O Keçi-niñüdana, k iller of the asura  Keçi! Kindly
destroy this doubt of mine in the same way that You killedthe asura  Keçi. O Mahä-bäho! You are supremely powerful,ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !991 1
whereas I have a minute amount of power. I have a friendly
relationship with You because we have some similar quali-ties, but my qualities cannot equal Your qualities, such asomniscience. I am only able to ask You this question with-out hesitation because You have bestowed upon me a littleof Your sakhya-bhäva .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In some parts of the Gétä , Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa has given
instructions pertaining to karma-sannyäsa  (the renuncia-
tion of activities), and in other parts He has instructedArjuna not to completely abandon karma (action), but to
renounce the desire for the fruits of all types of karma . From
a superficial perspective, there seems to be a contradictionbetween these two instructions. Arjuna wants Kåñëa toremove the doubts of people whose intelligence is mundane,so he is asking these questions about the real meaning oftyäga  and sannyäsa , about the difference between them, and
about their unique characteristics. The names Keçi-niñüdana, Håñékeça and Mahä-bäho used by Arjuna in thisçloka have specific meanings. Kåñëa killed an asura  called
Keçi who had a furious äsurika  nature; therefore, He is called
Mahä-bäho, supremely powerful. For this reason, Arjunasays, O Çré Bhagavän, You are fully capable of annihilat-ing the asura  of my doubts. This doubt has arisen in my
heart only by Your inspiration because You, Håñékeça, arethe prompter and master of all my senses. Only You cancompletely remove all my doubts and illuminate ätma-
tattva , bhagavat-tattva  and bhakti-tattva  within my heart.
This is the hidden meaning behind these three terms ofaddress. If, like Arjuna, a person surrenders to Bhagavän and
prays to Him for transcendental knowledge ( prema-bhakti ),
then Çré Bhagavän will sur ely fulfil his desire.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 992

ties; prähuù they declare; (to be) tyägam renunciation.
Çré Bhagavän said: According to expert paëòitas ,
complete renunciation of kämya-karma  (fruitive ac-
tivities) is called sannyäsa , whereas the renunciation
of the results of all activities is called tyäga .
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
This explanation is based on the opinion presented by Çré
Bhagavän to Arjuna in previous chapters. He begins by ex-plaining the different meanings of the two words sannyäsa
and tyäga  in this çloka  beginning with kämyänäm . The term
sannyäsa  applies to one who completely gives up all kämya-
karma , such as performing a yajïa  to fulfil the desire of hav-
ing a son or attaining Svarga, but who does not give up nitya-
karma  (obligatory activities), such as sandhyä-upäsanä (re-
membering gäyatré mantras ,  etc.) . The term tyäga  applies to
one who dutifully performs all kämya-karma  (fruitive activi-
ties) and nitya-karma  (obligatory activities) while renounc-
ing the fruits of these activities, but who does not abandonÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !993 2
the activities themselves. The results of performing nitya-
karma  are expounded throughout the çrutis . For example, it
is stated therein that one attains pitå-loka  (the planet of the
forefathers) by performing prescribed karma ,  and one be-
comes free from sins by performing particular dharmika  ac-
tivities. Therefore, tyäga  means to perform all activities with-
out desiring the fruits. The word sannyäsa  refers to one who
performs all nitya-karma  without desiring the results and gives
up kämya-karma  altogether. This is the difference between
these two terms.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çré Bhagavän gives the opinion of the tattva-vit  mahä-
puruñas  on the above subject matter. Sannyäsa  refers to one
who does not abandon nitya-karma  (obligatory duties) or
naimittika-karma  (occasional dharmika  duties incurred by
specific circumstances), but who completely gives up sakäma-
karma . And tyäga  is performed when one does not abandon
sakäma-karma  and nitya-naimittika-karma ,  but gives up
their fruits. Various places in çästra  describe both these un-
derstandings. This chapter reveals the opinion of ÇréBhagavän and His tattva-vit  bhaktas  regarding this subject.
One will only be able to perfectly reconcile these conceptsafter properly understanding their opinion.
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam ,  Çré Kåñëa instructs Uddhava, who
is the instrument for His teachings. He describes the threetypes of yoga, namely karma , jïäna  and bhakti , according to
the eligibility  (adhikära ) of different individuals. He instructs
karma-yoga  for those who are attached to karma  and its
results, and He instructs jïäna-yoga  for those who have com-
pletely renounced the results of karma . But He gives instruc-
tions on bhakti-yoga  for those moderate persons who are not
overly attached to the results of karma , nor are they dry
renunciants.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 994
Generally, in the initial stage of yoga practice, a baddha-
jéva only has sufficient adhikära  to perform karma . Çré
Bhagavän then gives instructions about giving up the resultsof karma  (tyäga ) and about the renunciation of karma
(sannyäsa ), in order to bestow upon him the adhikära  to enter
into the path of jïäna . In the early stages, while practising
to completely give up sakäma-karma , he should renounce the
fruits of nitya  and naimittika-karma . A persons heart is
purified after performing this practice for some time and hebecomes situated on the higher platform of jïäna . His
adhikära  to only perform karma  ceases at this stage. In other
words, he rises above karma . In that state, it is possible for
him to give up all karma  completely. According to the state-
ment, jïänam  ca mayi  sannyaset  (Çrémad-Bhägavatam 11.19.1),
even jïäna  should be renounced upon achieving perfection
in it. When they attain perfection in these practices, thekarmés  have to renounce karma  and the jïänés have to re-
nounce jïäna.  The sädhakas  of bhakti  however, do not need
to renounce bhakti  upon attaining perfection in it. Rather,
it is then that they start to execute bhakti  in its purest, most
developed manner. Therefore, Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa Himselfhas made the following statements: tävat  karmäëi  kurvéta ,
As long as one has not satiated his fruitive desires, or awak-ened his taste for bhajana ,  one has to follow the Vedic in-
junctions ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.20.9), jïäna-niñöho  virakto
vä,  The conduct of those dedicated to cultivating transcen-
dental jïäna ,  as well as My liberated bhaktas , is beyond the
range of rules and regulations ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.18.28);
yas tv ätma-ratir  eva syäd,  A person who delights in the self,
however, who remains contented and satisfied in the self, hasno duties to perform ( Gétä  3.17), and: sarva-dharmän
parityajya ,  Completely abandoning all bodily and mental
dharma , such as varëa  and äçrama , take exclusive shelter of
Me alone ( Gétä  18.66). The Yoga-väçiñöha  also states: naÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !995 2
karmäëi  tyajeta  yogé karmabhist yajyate  hy asäv iti. A yogé
should not give up karma  because the karma  itself will re-
nounce the yogé when he has attained an elevated level .
Generally, çästra  does not instruct baddha-jévas to give up
karma ; rather, it suggests that they give up kämya-karma  or
the results of karma . This is because generally the jéva in his
bound state is very much attached to performing sakäma-
karma . If he is instructed to give up karma  completely in the
beginning stage of his practice, he will not be able to do it.Therefore, such instructions are given to gradually bring thejéva to a higher platform.
The heart becomes purified by following this gradual pro-
cess in which one initially practises renouncing the fruits ofkarma . It is only possible to give up karma  completely when
one achieves ätma-rati  (the happiness of the self). For this
reason, Bhagavän gives the instruction: na buddhi-bhedaà
janayet  (Gétä  3.26). One should not instruct less intelligent
people, who are attached to karma , to give it up . Due to their
immature intelligence, they will become confused and devi-ate from the spiritual path. But it should be noted that onlya person who develops the adhikära  to engage in kevala-bhakti
can give up all karma nitya , naimittika  and kämya.  The
çloka , sarva-dharmän  parityajya ,  is spoken at the end of this
chapter for this reason only. In his commentary on this çloka ,
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura writes, When a per-son acquires the qualification to perform ananya-bhakti ,
there is no possibility of sin or fault if he does not performany nitya-karma.  This is the result of his good fortune which
has come about through the mercy of the great saints. How-ever, in that state, if he continues to engage in nitya  and
naimittika-karma , he incurs sin because he is not following
My instruction. In other words, the performance of nitya-
naimittika-karma  is unfavourable to the execution of kevala-
bhakti . Here, nitya-karma  refers to daily obligatory activities! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 996
such as the worship of various devas  and devés , as described
in the karma-märga  section of the Vedas . Naimittika -karma
means occasional religious activities such as the worship ofthe forefathers and devas  in the çräddha  ceremony. A person
enters into the realm of ananya-bhakti  to Çré Kåñëa only when
one completely abandons these activities. By studying Sat-
kriyä-sära-dépikä , by Çrémad Gopäla Bhaööa Gosvämé, the
great Gauòéya Vaiñëava äcärya  and protector of Gauòéya
Vaiñëava conceptions, we can understand that there are noinjunctions in any authoritative çästra  for the aikäntika-
bhaktas  of Çré Kåñëa to worship the forefathers and devas ,
regardless of which varëa  or äçrama  these bhaktas  belong to.
Rather, if the ananya-bhaktas  of Çré Kåñëa engage in the
worship of the forefathers or devas , it becomes seväparädha
and nämäparädha . Çrémad Gopäla Bhaööa Gosvämé uses
evidence from çästra to prove that, when Kåñëa is pleased by
a persons ananya-bhakti , that bhakta  does not incur any sin-
ful reaction, even if he gives up all other karma . Such
aikäntika-bhaktas  attain an auspicious position, whether they
are situated in this universe or beyond it.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Çré Kåñëa as saying,
Sannyäsa  means to give up all kämya-karma  completely
and perform nitya  and naimittika-karma  without desiring
the fruits. T yäga  means to give up the fruits of all types of
karma nitya , naimittika  and kämya -karma.  Learned people
explain this to be the difference between sannyäsa  and
tyäga .

Now Çré Bhagavän is stating His opinion in this çloka  be-

sättvika , räjasika  and tämasika . Çré Bhagavän says in Gétä
(18.7) that it is not appropriate  to renounce nitya-karma . The
tyäga  of those who give up nitya -karma  due to bewilderment
is described as tämasika . In Gétä  (18.7), tyäga  is referred to as
sannyäsa . Therefore, according to the opinion of Çré

Of the three types of tyäga , tämasika tyäga  is being ex-
plained here in relation to this subject. Mohät  refers to the
performance of tyäga  without knowing the purport of çästra.
Such tyäga  is called tämasika  tyäga . A sannyäsé  can give up
kämya -karma  (fruitive activities), thinking them to be un-
necessary, but it is not proper for him to give up nitya-karma .
This is implied by the word tu. Mohät  means out of igno-
rance. The result of tämasika tyäga  is also ignorance, and the
desired jïäna  is not achieved.

Those who do not perform tyäga  as previously de-
scribed attain three types of destinations after giv-ing up the body: a hellish existence (hell), a placewhere the 
devas  reside (celestial planets), or as hu-
mans in this world. Sannyäsés , however, never attain
such results.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
When a person does not perform tyäga  like this, he incurs
fault. It is due to the lack of such tyäga  that one receives
misery in hell ( aniñöam ), temporary happiness in the higher
planets ( iñöam ), or the combined happiness and misery of
human life ( miçram ). This happens only to those who are
not tyägés . It does not happen to the tyägés  (renunciants).
Pretya  means the next world.

How can a person who performs karma not receive the re-
sult of that karma ? Expecting this question, Çré Bhagavän is
now speaking five çlokas  to establish that people who are free
from ahaìkära , the false ego of being the doer, do not become
implicated in the results of karma . The first of these çlokas
begins with the word païcaitäni.  Hear from Me about the
five causes of action which are responsible for the completionof all activities. That which fully explains Paramätmä is calledsäìkhya . Säìkhya  (saì completely; khyä describes) is also
known as Vedänta-çästra , which explains how to nullify the
reactions of actions that have already been performed.

It is impossible for the embodied baddha-jévas  to give up all
work. Furthermore, it is detrimental for those who are unquali-fied to give up all types of work out of obstinacy. Therefore, those
in the initial stage of yoga practice, who only have the adhikära
to engage in karma , are instructed to give up akarma  and vikarma
and perform nitya  and naimittika -karma . When a persons at-
tachment to the fruits of karma  has gradually ceased, it is benefi-
cial and auspicious for him to perform the karma  prescribed in
çästra  as a matter of duty, without desiring the results. According
to Kåñëa, the symptom of a sannyäsé  and a yogé is that they per-
form karma  only as a duty, without desiring to enjoy the results.
Such persons are real sannyäsés  and yogés. Upon obtaining the
association of Vaiñëavas, such individuals can enter the realm ofbhakti  very quickly and attain the supreme destination.

the senses such as the eyes and ears, påthag-vidham  means
various types of endeavours, that is, the function of the life-airs such as präëa  and apäna , and daivam  means Antaryämé,
the indwelling prompter of everyone. These are the five causesof action.
S

The five causes of action mentioned in the previous çloka
are explained here in detail. It should be understood thatthe word adhiñöhänam  in this çloka  means this body, be-
cause action can only be performed when a baddha-jéva
becomes situated in this body. The ätmä  situated in this
body is called the doer, because it is he who performs theÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1007 14
action ( karma ). The pure ätmä  has nothing to do with this
karma , but he becomes the enjoyer of the results of karma
due to his false ego of being the doer. Therefore, the ätmä
itself is called both the knower and the doer. This is alsomentioned in the çrutis : eña hi drañöä  srañöä ,  It is actually
the soul who sees and is the doer ( Praçna-Upaniñad  4). The
Vedänta-sütra  also states, jïo ta eva. It is truly the soul
who is the knower ( Brahma-sütra  2.3.17), and: karttä
çästrärthavattvät  The jévätmä is understood as the doer
because this fact is confirmed in the çästra  (Brahma-sütra
2.3.31) and so on. All these statements substantiate theabove conclusion. The senses are the instruments used toperform karma.  The ätmä  accomplishes various types of
work only with the help of these senses. There is a sepa-rate endeavour for each activity, but every activity dependson the sanction of Parameçvara, who is situated withineveryones heart as a witness, friend and controller. Thus,
Parameçvara alone is the supreme cause. Those persons who
are inspired by a çästrä-vit , tattva-vit  mahä-puruña , and also
by Parameçvara, who is situated within their hearts, are ableto ascertain what is obligatory for them and what is not.Thus, they engage in the performance of bhakti  and very
quickly attain the supreme destination. They are not boundby the reactions of their good or bad karma .

An ignorant person cannot understand that a separate,
individual entity, known as Paramätmä, is situated in hisheart as a witness, controller and friend, and is regulatingall his activities. The body, the doer, the various endeavoursand the senses are all material causes of action. The promi-nent cause, however, is Paramätmä. Thus, one should see thatParamätmä, who is situated within the heart, is the supremecause of action; one should not just consider that these four
material causes accomplish an action. Those who are unable
to see in this way think of themselves as the only doers; thus,they always remain agitated.

Hence, in the opinion of Çré Bhagavän, sannyäsa  in the
form of renunciation ( tyäga ) in sattva-guëa  is instructed for
the jïänés , but for bhaktas ,  complete renunciation of karma-
yoga is recommended. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.11.32), Çré
Bhagavän says, O Uddhava, those who have carefullyanalysed the positive and negative aspects of dharma  and
adharma , but give up their sva-dharma  prescribed by Me in
the Vedas  to engage in bhajana  to Me, are indeed sattamaù ,
the best among men. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has explainedthe meaning of this çloka  as follows: Those who perform
bhajana to Me, completely giving up their sva-dharma  as
instructed by Me in the Vedas , are sattamaù , the best. Here
a question arises. If someone gives up his prescribed  sva-
dharma  out of ignorance or an atheistic propensity, will he
still be considered sattamaù ? In response, Çré Bhagavän says,! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1012
No. Those who are sattamaù  understand that favourable
qualities such as purity of existence resulting from the per-formance of dharmika  activities (prescribed duties according
to varëa  and äçrama ), and discrepancies caused by the ne-
glect of such activities, distract one from meditating uponMe. Those who understand this are sattamaù.  They possess
the firm determination that everything can be achieved byperforming bhakti  to Me, and they solely engage in bhajana
to Me, giving up all other dharmika  activities.
The words, dharmaà  santyajya  in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam
çloka quoted above (11.11.32), does not mean to give up the
results of dharma , but to give up dharma  itself. One should
understand that there is no discrepancy involved in givingup the results of dharma . This opinion is given in the state-
ments of Çré Bhagavän and is supported by those who haveexplained those statements. Jïäna  certainly requires purifi-
cation of the heart. The performance of niñkäma-karma
enables  one to achieve different levels of such purification,
and jïäna  rises in proportion to the degree that the heart is
purified. There is no other way for jïäna  to appear. There-
fore, it is imperative for even the sannyäsés  to practise
niñkäma-karma  for complete jïäna to appear in their hearts.
When the performance of karma  has completely purified the
heart, at that time karma  is no longer required. As it is also
said in Gétä  (6.3),  Karma  is the sädhana  for those who de-
sire jïäna-yoga , but for those who are already situated on
the stage of jïäna , the means is renunciation of this karma ,
as it causes a distraction. However Gétä  (3.17) says, There
is no prescribed karma  for those who derive pleasure from
the self and who are satisfied and happy in the self alone.But bhakti  is supremely independent and extremely powerful.
It does not depend upon purity of heart. Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(10.33.39) states: Those who with transcenden tal faith hearÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1013 18
Çré Kåñëas pastimes with the gopés  of Vraja, attain parä
bhakti  to Him, and thus very quickly become free from the
disease of the heart, which is mundane lust. How can thishappen? First parä bhakti  enters into the heart of a person
who is suffering from material lust and purifies it; conse-quently, the lust and anarthas  of such a qualified person are
destroyed. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.8.5) further states: Kåñëa
enters into the lotus-like hearts of the bhaktas  through the
ear, and removes all their impurities, just as the autumn sea-son purifies the rivers.
Why then, should the bhaktas  engage in karma  if the heart
becomes purified by performing bhakti  alone? To clarify this
point, the present çloka  is now spoken. Simply knowing that
the ätmä  is separate from the body does not comprise jïäna.
Rather, one is to understand ätma-tattva , the truth of the
ätmä. The only real jïänés  are those who have taken shelter
of such knowledge. But the three constituents of jïäna ,
namely knowledge ( jïäna ), the knowable ( jïeya ), and the
knower ( jïätä ) also have a relationship with karma . To un-
derstand this is the duty of the sannyäsés . For this purpose,
Çré Bhagavän is speaking this çloka  beginning with the word
jïänam . Here the word codanä  means injunction or process.
Çréla Gopala Bhaööa Gosvämé says that the words codanä ,
upadeça  (instruction) and vidhi  (rules and regulations) are
synonymous.
Now Bhagavän Himself is explaining the second half of
this çloka , starting with the words karaëaà  karma . Jïäna  is
that which helps us to know something . According to this
definition: jïäna  is the instrument, jïeya , the knowable
(jévätma-tattva ) is the object, and one who knows this truth
about the jévätmä  is jïätä , the subject . The instrument
(karaëa ), the object ( karma ) and the subject ( karttä ) are the
three factors known as karma -saìgrahaù  that are related to! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1014
niñkäma-karma.  This is the explanation of the compound
word karma -codanä . In other words, the performance of
niñkäma -karma-yoga  is based on these three: the principle
of knowledge ( jïäna ), the knowable ( jïeya ) and the knower
(jïätä ).
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The ätmä  is a nirguëa  entity, devoid of any material quali-
ties. The inspiration for karma  (karma-preraëä ), the basis
of karma  (karma-äçraya ) and the result of karma  (karma-
phala ) are all products of the three guëas . Therefore, they
have no constitutional relationship with the ätmä .
Aikäntika-bhaktas  of Çré Bhagavän, who are completely sur-
rendered to Him, know the ätmä perfectly. Although they
perform all activities either by the will of Kåñëa or for Hispleasure, they are never called karmés  (materialists). The only
designation which adorns them is that of bhakta ; thus, they
do not get entangled in the web of karma .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Knowledge ( jïäna ), the knowable ( jïeya ) and the knower
(jïätä ) are the three impulses of action known as karma -
codanä . The instrument ( karaëa ), the object ( karma ) and the
doer ( karttä ) are the three-fold basis of karma  known as
karma -saìgrahaù . Whatever action a person performs has
two states: codanä  (inspiration) and saìgrahaù  (basis). The
process which precedes karma  is called codanä . Inspiration
is the subtle existence of action, and it is the faith that ex-ists in the mind before the gross state of action manifests.The stage which precedes action is divided into three parts: 1)knowledge of the instrument of action; 2) the knowable ob-ject of action and; 3) the performer of action. The execution
of action has three divisions: 1) karaëatva  (the instrument),
2) karmatva  (the object), and 3) karttåtva  (the subject) .ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1015 19 - 20

the midst of that which is perishable, he is not perishable.Although the various jévätmäs  are different ( vibhakteñu ), they

This çloka  has a very deep meaning. The cause of all causes,
the controller of all controllers, and the source of everyoneis the primeval Svayaà Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa. Although Heis one, He manifests in this universe as various avatäras . They
are all one in Their essence ( svarüpa ) and in Their tattva .
There is some gradation of vaiçiñöya  (unique characteristics)
amongst Them based on rasa and viläsa  (pastimes). Yet They
are one. The jévas manifest from Him as vibhinnäàça  (sepa-
rated parts) and are very subtle entities. They are unlimitedin number. Çvetäçvatara  Upaniñad  (5.9) states:
bälägra-çata-bhägasya / çatadhä kalpitasya ca
bhägo jévaù sa vijïeyaù / sa cänantyäya kalpate
It is said that the size of the jéva is one-hundredth the tip of a
hair which is again divided into a hundred parts. Such  jévas are
declared to be eternal.ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1017 21
As explained earlier, these jévas are of two types: baddha
(bound) and mukta  (liberated). Although they are unlimited
in number, they are all one in tattva  in regard to their con-
scious nature ( cit-tattva ). They are all Kåñëa däsa by consti-
tutional nature, although they take birth in various speciessuch as devas , humans, animals and birds. To establish this
siddhänta , Çré Kåñëa is explaining that through sättvika jïäna
one sees that unlimited jévas exist in various bodies such as
devas , asuras , humans, animals and birds in order to experi-
ence the various fruits of their karma. From the perspective
of cit-tattva  (conscious reality), by sättvika jïäna ,  one also
perceives them as indivisible, immutable and without anydifference in nature.

that there are separate types of ätmäs  in different bodies. By
the influence of räjasika  jïäna ,  one may conclude that the
soul is the cause of happiness and distress, or that happinessand misery are without any basis. In other words, one seesthat their occurence is merely accidental. The jïäna  by which
one sees the oneness of all conceptions of existence, such asthe inert, the conscious, the all-pervading, or the atomicparticles, is known as räjasika  jïäna .
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Räjasika jïäna  determines different understandings. This
means that those who do not believe in the existence of a tran-
scendental world say that the body itself is the ätmä.  The Jains
say that although the ätmä  is different from the body, it is lim-
ited by the body, that is, it has no existence separate from it.The Buddhists say that the ätmä  is conscious for a limited
period of time. The logicians say that the ätmä  is the basis of
nine types of special qualities, that is, it is different from thebody, and is not inert. The jïäna  by which these various un-
derstandings arise in relation to the ätmä  is räjasika jïäna .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, Those who have räjasika
jïäna  say that the jévätmäs  which exist in different species,
such as humans, animals and birds, belong to different classesand that their constitutional natures are also different.

And tämasika jïäna  is that knowledge which causes
one to be absorbed in activities related to the tempo-rary body, such as bathing and eating, considering themto be the ultimate perfection. This is irrational, de-void of any spiritual substance or reality, and meagrelike that of the animals.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Now Çré Bhagavän is explaining tämasika  jïäna . Tämasika
jïäna  is that knowledge which is devoid of any spiritual basis,
and which only fosters attachment to the natural acts of thebody, such as bathing, eating, drinking, and enjoying women,as well as to the various ways of attaining such enjoyment.Nor does it foster attachment to Vedic activities such as yajïa
and däna.  Tämasika jïäna also lacks any essential meaning
in relation to tattva  and is insubstantial and unimportant like
the knowledge or instincts of animals. In brief, knowledgeof the Absolute Reality, which is beyond the body ( tat-
padärtha ), is sättvika ; knowledge of nyäya-çästras , for example,
which are full of various arguments and counter-arguments,is räjasika ; and materialistic knowledge, which is simply re-
lated to the demands of the body, such as bathing and eat-ing, is tämasika .! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1020

Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, The jïäna  of those
who consider bodily activities such as bathing and eating
to be most important, and which encourages attachment
to such activities, is inferior and is called tämasika jïäna.
Although this jïäna  is improper and does not contain any
essential tattva ,  it appears to be natural and of value. The
conclusion is that knowledge of tat-padärtha  (the Absolute
Reality), which is separate from the body, is called sättvika
jïäna.  Knowledge of various çästras  such as nyäya , which
establish different argumentative philosophies, is calledräjasika  jïäna.  And the knowledge which deals with bodily
activities, such as bathing and eating, is called tämasika
jïäna.

nature, who is obstinate, deceptive, insulting to oth-ers, lazy, despondent and procrastinating, is said tobe

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Ayuktaù  means one who performs improper acts. Präkåtaù
means one who is situated in his own acquired nature. Suchpersons act according to the dictates of their minds. Theydo not even follow the orders of their guru . Naiñkåtikaù
means one who insults others.  Jïänés ,  therefore, should per-
form sättvika  tyäga  which possesses the characteristics de-
scribed earlier. One should only take shelter of the jïäna  that
arises when one is fixed in sättvika  karma . Indeed, sättvika
karma  is obligatory. One should be a sättvika  karttä.  This is
the sannyäsa  of the jïänés.  This is the jïäna  of the jïänés.
It is related to the self, and is the essence of this subjectmatter.
However, the jïäna  of the bhaktas  is tri-guëätéta , beyond
the three guëas . The karma  which is performed for Me is tri-
guëätéta  and is called bhakti , and its doer ( karttä ) is also tri-
guëätéta . As Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.24) states,  Kaivalya-
jïäna , knowledge of the self, is sättvika ; jïäna  which is based
on duality or manifold variety is räjasika ; mundane jïäna
which is related to the body is tämasika ; and that jïäna  which
is fixed in Me is nirguëa . This nirguëa-jïäna  is said to be
the characteristic of nirguëa -bhakti-yoga  as stated in Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (3.29.12). Pure bhajana is exhibited by one whose
mind is at once attracted to hearing an uninterupted flow of! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1026
hari-kathä , just as the Gaìgä flows to the ocean. Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.25.26) states: That karttä  who is unattached
is sättvika , he who is attached is räjasika , and he who has
lost his sense of discrimination is tämasika , but that karttä
who is surrendered to Me is nirguëa . Furthermore, not only
the jïäna , karma  and karttä related to  bhakti are nirguëa ,
but, from the perspective of bhakti , anything related to bhakti
is nirguëa . In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.27), there is also a
statement concerning çraddhä : Çraddhä  related to ätma-
jïäna is sättvika , çraddhä  which is based on karma  is räjasika ,
and çraddhä  based on adharma  is tämasika , but çraddhä  in
service to Me is nirguëa . Concerning residence, Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.25.25) states: To live in the forest is sättvika ,
to live in the village is räjasika , and to live in the gambling
house (the city, which is the centre of various deceitful ac-tivities) is tämasika , but My residence (the place of My wor-
ship) and the association of My bhaktas  is nirguëa . Con-
cerning happiness, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.29) states: The
happiness arising from the self is sättvika , that arising from
sense objects is räjasika , that arising from delusion and mean-
spiritedness is tämasika , while the happiness that results from
surrendering unto Me is nirguëa .
Therefore, the personal happiness that My guëätéta-
bhaktas  derive from that jïäna , karma  and çraddhä  which
are related to bhakti  is guëätéta.  Everything related to the
jïäna  of sättvika jïänés  is sättvika.  Everything related to
räjasika  karmés  is räjasika , and everything related to unre-
strained tämasika  people is tämasika . This is discerned from
the statements of Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam .
The Fourteenth Chapter also states that the jïänés  ulti-
mately attain freedom from the material guëas  by the per-
formance of kevala-bhakti ,  which manifests only after jïäna
has been relinquished.ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1027 29

tämasaù småti-vibhrañöo / nirguëo mad-apäçrayaù

Çré Bhagavän is concluding this subject by explaining what
He has not yet described. Ta t sattvam  means that no living
being or object in the creation is free from the three guëas ,
which are born of material nature. Therefore, everything is
composed of the three guëas  of material nature, and only
that which is sättvika  is useful; that which is räjasika  or
tämasika  is not. This is the purport of this topic.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çré Bhagavän is concluding this subject by stating, Every-
thing that is related to this material world is composed ofthe three guëas  of material nature. The superiority of that
which is sättvika  has been established. One is instructed to
ardently take shelter of and accept only what is sättvika .
However, in order to become free from the bondage of thismaterial world, it is necessary to take shelter of that whichis nirguëa . Bhagavän, bhakta , bhakti , and all the instruments,
bhävas  and so forth, for sevä, are nirguëa . Without adopting
them, a jéva cannot achieve his ultimate benefit. Therefore,
it is the supreme duty of all intelligent individuals to endeav-our to rise above the three guëas  of material nature by the
influence of sädhu-saìga.  Being thus situated in their nirguëa! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1036
nature, they should enter into the nirguëa-prema-mayé  sevä
of Bhagavän. A table of subjects and their guëas is given on
the next page by which the sädhaka  will be able to easily
understand the guëas and, thus, comprehend nirguëa-tattva .
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.30-31) describes the above-men-
tioned subjects that are within the three guëas  and beyond
them. Çré Bhagavän says to Uddhava:
dravyaà deçaù phalaà kälo / jïänaà karma ca kärakaù
çraddhävasthäkåtir niñöhä / trai-guëyaù sarva eva hi
sarve guëa-mayä bhäväù / puruñävyakta-dhiñöhitäù
dåñöaà çrutam anudhyätaà / buddhyä vä puruñarñabha
Various objects, places, results of activities, käla (time), jïäna ,
karma , the performers of action, çraddhä , form and allegiance,
all consist of the three guëas  of material nature. O best among
men, all that is seen, heard or conceived of within the mind issituated within prakåti  and puruña ,  and is, therefore, composed
of the three guëas .
How can one conquer the three guëas ? In this regard, Çré
Bhagavän says in Ç rémad-Bhägavatam  (11.25.32):
etäù saàsåtayaù puàso / guëa-karma-nibandhanäù
yeneme nirjitäù saumya / guëä jévena citta-jäù
bhakti-yogena man-niñtùo / mad bhäväya prapadyate
O gentle one, because the jéva mistakes the body for the self, he is
bound by the guëas  and by karma.  Thus, he wanders throughout
the various species of life. Those who are influenced by the asso-ciation of bhaktas ,  practise bhakti-yoga.  Consequently, they con-
quer the material modes that manifest in the mind as the falseego (considering the body to be the self) and they become firmlydevoted to Me. Thus, they attain bhagavat-sevä  to Me in My dhäma.
Çré Bhagavän is nirguëa-tattva . The bhaktas  who take
shelter of Him are also nirguëa . Ananya-bhakti  and itsÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1037 41
associated limbs are also nirguëa . The various objects and
moods that the bhaktas  accept as useful instruments in
bhakti , and with which they engage in the service of
Bhagavän, become nirguëa  by His inconceivable power.
This principle has been established in various placesthroughout çästras ,  such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam .

In order to elevate humans beyond the three guëas  of ma-
terial nature and gradually raise them to a higher adhikära ,
Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa establishes varëa-dharma  by dividing their
prescribed duties according to their respective guëas  (qualities)
and karma  (actions). The arrangement of the pure varëa  sys-
tem is very beneficial, auspicious and scientific for human life.With the passing of time, however, the common man has lostfaith in this system, having witnessed various defects in its so-called followers. This faith is lost to such an extent that, now,even common people in Indian society blame the varëäçrama
system for the divisions and hostility created by its castes. Theyalso assert that varëa-dharma  is the main cause of Indias
social, political and economic collapse. They say that Indianpeople are less advanced than those of other countries becauseof varëäçrama-dharma . The majority of Indias population is
becoming determined to completely destroy the varëa-dharma
and establish an atheistic society without any varëa . It is easy
to destroy a useful thing, but it is extremely difficult to ini-tiate and propagate, in this case, an ideal system. May ÇréBhagavän bestow good intelligence upon such people. Are theytaking this stance after careful deliberation? Or are they sim-ply being carried away by their sentiments, thus developing firmresolve to completely destroy the individual, as well as societyas a whole, at the roots? In this regard, we are quoting some
meaningful portions from Çré Caitanya-Çikñämåta  by Çréla
Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura. We humbly request the faithful readerto carefully examine and understand it.ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1039 41
Ones inclinations or qualities depend only upon ones
nature, sva-bhäva . A person should work according to that
individual nature. Work which is not executed in accor-dance with his nature is not fruitful. The English wordgenius is used to refer to a particular part of ones na-ture. It is not easy for a person to change his maturednature, therefore, he should endeavour for his livelihoodand spiritual perfection by working in accordance with hisnature. People in India are divided into four varëas  in
accordance with four types of nature. As a result of peoplebeing properly situated in society, having followed theinjunctions of the varëa  system, all social activities natu-
rally become fruitful and humanity attains all auspicious-ness. The varëa  system is based on solid scientific under-
standing. A society which has such a foundation is wor-thy of respect by all of humanity.
Some people may doubt the varëäçrama  system, saying,
No one in Europe and America follows these injunctions
which are based on varëa  divisions, yet the people of those
lands are more advanced and respected than the Indianpeople in economy, science and other ways. They concludethat it is useless to accept such a system. But such doubtsare baseless, because the European societies are quite new.People of such modern societies are generally stronger andmore courageous. With that courage and strength, theyperform various activities in the world and accept portionsof the knowledge, science and arts which have been pre-served by the older societies. But all these new societieswill gradually become extinct because their social arrange-ment has no scientific foundation. However, symptoms ofthe original varëa  system that existed in ancient Indias
Äryan society can still be observed in current Indian so-ciety, even though it is now so old and weak.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1040
Previously, the Roman and Greek societies were more
powerful and advanced than those of modern Europeancountries, but what is their present plight? They have losttheir own ancient caste system, and have embraced the reli-gions and systems of modern societies to such an extent thatthe people of those castes do not even boast the glory of theirnoble ancestors. Although the Äryan society of India is mucholder than the Roman and Greek societies, the present Äryansfeel proud of their great heroic forefathers. What is the rea-son for this? It is because the foundation of Äryan societywas so strongly based on the varëäçrama  system that their
social or caste traits still remain. The descendants of Räma,who were defeated by the mlecchas , still consider themselves
to be the heroic descendants of Çré Rämacandra. As long asthe varëa  arrangement is existing in India, people will un-
doubtedly remain Äryan; they can never become non-Äryan,no matter how fallen they become due to the time-worn and
antiquated condition of the society.
The European Äryan descendants, such as the Romans,
have intermingled and become integrated with the lowest castessuch as the Häna and Bhäëòäla. By studying the structure ofthe present European societies, we will find that whatevercharm exists in them is due to the fact that they have in someway embraced the principles of the varëa  system, which has
manifested through their own natural propensities. In Europe,those people who have a vaiçya  nature consider it beneficial
to engage in business, and because of that alone, they aremaking economic progress. Those who have the nature of akñatriya  will voluntarily become soldiers, and those who have
the nature of a çüdra  generally prefer to perform menial ser-
vices. In fact, no society can exist without accepting the varëa-
dharma  in some form or other. Even when a marriage is ar-
ranged, the higher or lower state of the bride and grooms varëa
and nature are examined and considered.ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1041 41
Although varëa-dharma  is partially accepted in Europe,
it has not been established in its full, scientifically-basedform. Wherever knowledge and civilization make progress,varëa -dharma  will proportionately manifest in a more com-
plete form. Two types of methods are effective in every ac-tivity: the unscientific and the scientific. An activity is per-formed unscientifically until the scientific process is accepted.For example, before the invention of power driven ships,people used to travel in boats designed to depend on the winds.But, when scientifically manufactured ships were introduced,all voyages were made on them. The same principle can alsobe applied to society. Until the varëa  system becomes prop-
erly established in a country, its society will be run by someunscientific, rudimentary system. Such an elementary andprimitive arrangement of varëa  is currently operating and
controlling societies in all countries of the world, save andexcept for India. India has therefore been called karma -
kñetra , the land for the proper execution of karma.
At this point in our discussion, the question may be raised
as to whether or not the varëa  system is actually function-
ing properly in India today. The answer is that it is mostdefinitely not. Although previously this varëa  system was
fully established, in course of time it became diseased. Con-sequently, degradation of this system is now visible in India.What, we may ask, is that disease? The answer is given inthe following explanation.
At the beginning of Tretä-yuga, the Äryan society had
reached the pinnacle of its progressive development. At thattime, the varëäçrama  system was established. An arrange-
ment was made to determine the varëa  of every person ac-
cording to his nature. Upon acquiring the requisite qualifi-cations set forth, he would perform his prescribed work inthat varëa  only. The activities of the world were thus very
comfortably managed with the labour divided according to! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1042
the qualification and nature of the individual. A person
whose father had no varëa  was accommodated by being
placed in the appropriate varëa  after his nature was exam-
ined. The Vedic histories about Jäbälé and Gautama, Jänaçrutiand Citraratha, etc., give evidence of this. A persons varëa
was ascertained on the basis of his own nature and on thebasis of his family lineage in cases where his fathers varëa
was known. In the dynasty of Nariñyanta, Agniveça himselfbecame the great sage known as Jätukarëa. It is from himthat the famous brähmaëa  dynasty known as Agniveçyäyana
originated. In the Aila dynasty, Jahnu, the son of Hotra,attained the status of a brähmaëa . In the dynasty of
Bharadväja, who was born in the dynasty of Bharata andwho was known as King Vitatha, there came two progenies,the one from Nara became kñatriyas ,  and the progeny of
Garga became brähmaëas . In the dynasty of King Bharyasva,
maudgalya  gotra  brähmaëas ,  such as Çatänanda and
Kåpäcärya were born. There are many such examples in
çästra , of which only a few have been cited.
When the varëa  system was functioning in a cultured
manner, Indias fame spread all over the world like the pow-erful glow of the midday sun. People from all countries of theworld paid homage to India and accepted their rulers, con-trollers and spiritual masters as their own. People of coun-tries such as Egypt and China would hear and receive in-structions from the Indians with great faith and reverence.
The above-mentioned varëäçrama-dharma  continued in
its pure form in India for a long time. Later, through theinfluence of time, Jamadagni and his son Paraçuräma, whohad the nature of kñatriyas ,  were unlawfully accepted as
brähmaëas ,  but they gave up their caste as brähmaëas , as it
was opposed to their nature. This caused a disturbance to thepeace of the world order by creating a dispute between thebrähmaëas  and the kñatriyas . The unfavourable result of thisÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1043 41
quarrel was that within the varëa  system more emphasis was
placed on birth. In course of time, this perverted varëa  sys-
tem was covertly introduced, even infiltrating çästras  such
as the Manu-småti.  The kñatriyas  lost all hope of attaining a
higher varëa  and they revolted. They supported the Buddhist
dharma  and focused all their energy on destroying the
brähmaëas . The degree to which a new activity or opinion
is propagated, is opposed to in a proportionate degree. Whenthe Buddhist dharma , which was opposed to the Vedas , arose
to confront the brähmaëas , the varëa  arrangement based
upon birth became even more deeply rooted. A disagreementensued between this ill-conceived system and a spirit of na-tionalism, which gradually led to a virtual disintegration ofthe Äryan civilization in India.
Driven by selfish motives, the so-called brähmaëas ,  who
were bereft of any brähmiëical qualities, composed their ownreligious scriptures and began to cheat the other varëas . The
so-called kñatriyas  who had lost their true kñatriya  spirit and
qualities, became averse to engaging in battle and, thus be-gan to lose their kingdoms. Finally, they started to preachthe comparatively insignificant and inferior Buddhistdharma . The vaiçyas ,  who did not possess any real business
qualities and acumen, began propogating religions such asJainism. Under these circumstances, the world-wide businessventures of India gradually declined, and the çüdras  who had
no real çüdra  qualities, became almost like dacoits, being
unable to find work befitting their nature. As a result, thecultivation of knowledge of and discussions on sat-çästras
such as the Vedas  gradually came to a halt. The rulers of
the mleccha countries then attacked India at an opportune
time and established their control. Indias shipping industrysuffered and finally ceased due to improper management. Inthis way, the influence of Kali intensified. Alas! The Äryanrace of India, which once was the ruler and guru  of all other! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1044
societies on earth, deteriorated to the pitiable condition we
see today. The reason for this unfortunate development is notthe aging of Indian civilization, but the numerous defects thathave permeated the varëa  system.
Parameçvara is the original controller of all systems and
living entities. He has the ability to remove all inauspiciouselements and bestow all auspiciousness. If He so desires, Hemay send His empowered representative to re-establishvarëäçrama -dharma . Even the writers of the Puräëas  assert
that Çré Kalki-deva will make His advent and reinstate thepristine glory of varëäçrama-dharma . The story of King Maru
and Deväpi describes a similar expectancy. We will now dis-cuss the vidhis (rites) within varëäçrama-dharma .
Dharma-çästra  gives a detailed explanation about the
karma (duties) that a person in each varëa  has the right to
perform. It is not possible to present the full details of thatsubject in the context of this book. Activities such as serving
food to guests, bathing thrice a day for purity, worshipping
devatäs  and devés , studying the Vedas , giving instructions,
performing püjä, observing vratas  such as upanayana  (accept-
ing the sacred thread), brahmacarya  and sannyäsa  are the
activities prescribed for brähmaëas.  Kñatriyas  have the right
to perform activities such as fighting for dharma , ruling a
kingdom, protecting the subjects and generously distributingcharity. Vaiçyas have the right to perform such activities as
protecting animals and executing business endeavours. Theright of the çüdras  is to perform service to the devatäs  with-
out the utterance of mantras ,  and to render various services
to the above-mentioned three varëas .
Apart from the activities that are exclusive to their own
varëas , all men and women have the common right to per-
form activities such as marriage, éçvara-bhakti , welfare ac-
tivities, general charity, service to the guru, honouring guests,ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1045 42
purificatory rites, celebrating festivals, serving the cows, pro-
ducing progeny and following prescribed codes of conduct.Women have the special right to engage in the service of theirhusbands. The basic principle is that a person has the rightto perform duties which are conducive to his or her ownnature. With simple intelligence, everyone can ascertain hisor her particular right to perform work. If a person does nothave the ability to do that, then he should approach a bonafide guru  to ascertain his nature and rights. Those Vaiñëavas

the brähmaëas .
In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (5.5.24), Rñabhadeva says:

Who can be superior to the brähmaëas ? By their study they are
sustaining My very beautiful and primeval form of the Vedas ,
which are the avatära of transcendental sound, and they areÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1047 42
endowed with the eight supremely pure qualities of sattva-guëa :
control of the mind, control of the senses, truthfulness, mercy,penance, tolerance, knowledge and realisation ( bhakti ).
Here, it should be understood that a real brähmaëa  who is
endowed with such qualities cannot be the cause of harm orviolence to any person, society, community or nation. Un-doubtedly, such individuals are the well-wishing friends ofevery living being. This statement is most definititely true.But those who are bereft of brähmiëical qualities will onlycause great harm to society although pretentiously proclaim-ing themselves to be brähmaëas ; of this there is no doubt. At
the same time, it is not correct to envy the whole varëa  sys-
tem because of this defect and make efforts to destroy it com-pletely. The proper course of action to correct the defects thathave crept into this system is for society to honour those who
truly possess such good qualities.
According to the Gétä , a person should be appropriately
honoured after ascertaining his varëa  based on his quali-
ties, actions, nature and his impressions from previous lives.This will make it possible for brähmaëas  like Vasiñöha,
Närada and Vyäsa to make their appearance in our soci-ety. Peace and happiness will be established throughout theworld if such elevated brähmaëas  and great kñatriya  heroes
like Çré Räma, Arjuna, Bhéma and Mahäräja Bharata takebirth here.
The atheistic society that is taking shape today is without
any concern for caste or divisions. It is simply giving rise tomurder, looting, dacoitry, cheating and other sinful activi-ties. Agitation and fear are all-pervading. The world has neverbefore seen such a miserable condition. It is said in Çrémad-

A persons varëa can be ascertained by noting in him particular
symptoms that have been described for establishing the varëas
of humans. A person should be assigned to a varëa according to
these particular symptoms. Varëa  cannot be decided merely by
birth.

It is more beneficial to perform ones own occupational duty
(sva-dharma ), even though inferior or imperfectly performed,
than to perfectly execute the higher duty of another ( para-
dharma ). By performing his sva-dharma , a man incurs no sin.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
It is not proper to engage in sättvika  acts, having lost in-
terest in ones own dharma , considering it to be räjasika .
Thus, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the word
çreyän . Even though one is unable to perform ones lowly,
inferior sva-dharma  properly, it is better than properly per-
forming para-dharma ,  which may appear to be superior.
Therefore, O Arjuna, it is improper for you to renounce yoursva-dharma  of fighting just because you see the killing of
relatives as detrimental, in order to perform para-dharma , the
occupation of others who wander and beg.

Here it should be understood that one can accept the con-
clusion of the present çloka  only when the word sva-dharma
implies varëäçrama-dharma.  But when the word sva-dharma
is used to imply ätma-dharma , bhakti  to Çré Hari, then one
must accept the conclusions of the çlokas  such as sarva-
dharmän  parityajya . Where sva-dharma  means ätma-
dharma , the word para-dharma  means activities related to
the body and mind. Until a person develops faith in ätma-
dharma , it is beneficial to perform prescribed duties accord-
ing to his innate nature. As it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.20.9):
tävat karmäëi kurvéta / na nirvidyeta yävatä
mat-kathä-çravaëädau vä / çraddhä yävan na jäyate
As long as one is not satiated by fruitive activity and has notÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1053 48
awakened his taste for bhajana by çravaëam ,  kértanam ,  etc., one
has to follow the principles of çästra .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura says, It is better to perform sva-
dharma  even improperly than to engage in para-dharma  ex-
pertly. Sva-dharma  means the duties prescribed according to
ones natural aptitude and innate qualities. Therefore, even ifsva-dharma  is sometimes not executed expertly, it is always
beneficial. There is no possibility of incurring sin by perform-ing duties which are prescribed according to ones own nature.

It is not proper to think that there is only fault in ones
sva-dharma ,  as there is certainly some fault in para-dharma
also. To clarify this point, Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka
beginning with the word saha-jam.  One should perform the! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1054
duty that is in accordance with ones nature, because all work
(karma ), be it seen (manifest) or unseen (unmanifest) is
tinged with some defect, just as fire is covered by smoke. Aperson overlooks the defect of a fires smoke while utilisingits light and heat to dispel darkness and cold. In the sameway, one must accept the positive aspect of ones prescribedduty for the purification of ones existence, and neglect thedefective aspect.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Generally, duties that are prescribed according to ones
nature are called sva-dharma . By performing such duties a
person can maintain his life very easily, and he may alsopossibly gradually enter spiritual life. If a person accepts theprescribed duties of others, having observed some fault inhis own sva-dharma , there is a possibility that he may in-
cur even more sin. If one gives up ones kñatriya-dharma ,
considering it to be violent, and accepts the duty of abrähmaëa , thinking that it is free from such faults, then
there is the possibility of impropriety, because even theduties that are prescribed according to the nature of thebrähmaëas  are subject to the three guëas . Since the instru-
ments for performing brähmiëical acts are material, therealways remains some fault or other in activities performedwith them. For example, there is always the possibility ofkilling living entities while performing a fire yajïa . For this
reason, the example of fire is given here. Fire remains cov-ered by smoke. This is a defect of fire, but the fire is stillaccepted in order to dispel cold, to cook and serve otherpurposes. According to this same reasoning, it is beneficialto engage only in ones prescribed activities. A person utilises
the fire he lights after removing some portion of the smoke.
In the same way, after overcoming the defects of his karmaÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1055 49
by offering that karma  to Çré Bhagavän, one should accept
that aspect of it which gives rise to jïäna  for the purpose of
self-realisation.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Çri Kåñëa as saying, O
Kaunteya, even if the duties that are prescribed according toones nature are defective, they should by no means be relin-quished. Every endeavour is covered by some defect. Just asfire is always covered by smoke, defects cover and contami-nate every action. A man should accept the positive part ofthe karma  which is prescribed according to his nature for the
purpose of purifying his existence, and should discard thedefective part.

Action ( karma ) becomes defective when, due to false ego,
a person considers himself to be the doer and desires the fruit
of that activity. The first stage of sannyäsa  is to give up these
defects and remain engaged in karma . Gradually, however,
when the sädhana  of such a sannyäsé  matures and he becomes
firmly situated in yoga (yogärüòha ), he may completely re-
nounce all karma.  This is the second stage of sannyäsa .
Asakta-buddhiù  refers to one whose intelligence is free from
all attachment to material objects. Jitätmä  means one whose
mind is under control and vigata-spåhaù  means one who does
not even desire the happiness of Brahma-loka. Such personsattain supreme perfection in the form of naiñkarmya  by giv-
ing up all karma  completely. In the yogärüòha  stage, their
naiñkarmya  (reaction-free or desireless action) attains per-
fection in the highest sense.

A sädhaka-jéva  attains the nature of brahma  (brahma-

of sattva-guëa , rajo-guëa  and tamo-guëa.  That means he
attains a state of pure consciousness, free from any covering,and thus becomes prasannätmä  (fully joyful). Having
achieved this higher state, he neither laments for what hehas lost, nor hankers for what he does not have. In such astate, he is free from the false ego of considering the body tobe the self. Sarveñu  bhüteñu  means in all beings, good or bad.
Samaù  means that he develops equal vision like that of a child,
thereby becoming free from any external identification. Hisdesire for jïäna  becomes satiated, just like a fire that has been
extinguished due to lack of fuel. He then attains My imper-ishable bhakti  in the form of çravaëam  and kértanam  (which
is vested in jïäna ). Bhakti  is a function of My svarüpa-çakti
and even continues to exist when ajïäna  and jïäna cease,
because it is separate from My illusory potency. Therefore,the word paräm  means separate, or superior to jïäna.  In other
words, paräm  means kevala-bhakti , which is devoid ofÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1061 54
niñkäma-karma , jïäna , etc. The word labhate  means that
previously, bhakti , which was partially situated in jïäna  and
vairägya  and practised for the purpose of achieving mokña ,
was not intelligibly realised, just as Antaryämé, situated inall beings, cannot be realised very easily. Therefore, the wordlabhate  (obtain) has been used instead of the word kurute
(does). A golden gem which has become mixed with grainssuch as müng  or urad  däl can be retrieved even when the
grains are destroyed by grinding. This is because the gem iscomparatively imperishable. In the same way, bhakti ,  which
is partially situated in jïäna  and vairägya ,  can be achieved
independently when jïäna  and vairägya  are dispelled. This
is the most opportune time to attain pure prema-bhakti.  The
result of such bhakti  is never säyujya-mukti . Therefore, the
word paräm  here must mean prema-lakñaëä  bhakti , or bhakti
endowed with the symptoms of prema .

ment and it is the svarüpa  of brahma . T attvam  asi actually
means, You belong to Him, or you are His servant. Thiswas also clarified earlier. The mäyävädés , however, explain
it to mean, You are also that (Him). This explanation iscompletely distorted and misleading. Also, in regard to the
statement ahaà  brahmäsmi , the jéva is designated as brahma
simply because he has some qualitative similarity withbrahma. Because the jéva is the separated part of brahma ,  he
is also cit-svarüpa  (conscious by nature), but he can be con-
trolled by mäyä because he is only a separated part.
Parabrahma ,  however, is the controller of mäyä . The jéva is
atomic and parabrahma  is an infinite entity, therefore, these
two can never become one.
The entire creation containing both conscious and inert
energies has manifested from parabrahma . Inert matter and
consciousness are the transformations of brahmas  potency,
and are partially one with Him; they are not completely onewith Him. A person can thus understand the true import ofthe Vedas  only after he first considers the precise meaning
of each and every Upaniñad  mantra  individually, after which
he deliberates upon them collectively to comprehend theirÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1063 54
meaning as a whole. If a person unnecessarily speculates and
interprets the peripheral statements of the Vedas , he will only
arrive at false conclusions. One must, therefore, properlyunderstand Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhus definitive instruc-tions on acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva  in order to avoid any
misinterpretation.
There are abundant mantras  in the Vedas  which establish
the difference between the jéva and brahma . Some of those
mantras  are cited below:
1) pradhäna-kñetra-jïa-patir  guëeçaù  (Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  6.16). He is the controller of the guëas  and mas-
ter of the kñetra-jïa  living entities.
2) tam ähur  agryam  puruñaà  mahäntam  (Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  3.19). Sages declare Him to be the foremost and
greatest of persons.
3) yäthätathyato  rthän  vyadadhät  (Éçopaniñad  8). It is He
who awards the many jévas necessities.
4) tenedaà  pürëaà  puruñeëa  sarvam  (Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  3.9). By that Persons arrangement, this universe
is complete in every respect.
5) nityo  nityänäà  (Kaöha  Upaniñad  5.13, Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  6.13). He is supreme among all eternal beings.
It can be clearly understood from the above quotations that
the jéva can never merge with brahma  and become one with
Him. Therefore, brahma-bhüta  actually means that the jéva
becomes situated in his eternal constitutional position. Thesymptoms of jévas who have achieved the brahma-bhüta  stage
are explained as follows:
a) prasannätmä : The first characteristic is that they remain
always joyful due to being freed from the effects of the subtlebody, which is composed of the three material guëas .
b) na çocati : They never lament for that which has been
lost.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1064
c) na käìkçati : They do not hanker for what they do not
have.
d) samaù sarveñu bhüteñu : Like a child, they possess equal
vision towards all beings, good or bad.
e) mad bhaktià paräm : They have an intense desire to
attain My parä bhakti .
Mahätmäs  who have attained the brahma-bhüta  stage,
which is endowed with the above mentioned symptoms, inthe association of sädhus ,  attain parä premä bhakti  unto Çré
Bhagavän. It is also appropriate at this point to understandthe true meaning of the word parä bhakti.
anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam
änukülyena kåñëänuçélanaà bhaktir uttamä
Uttamä -bhakti  means the cultivation of activities which are
meant exclusively for the pleasure of Çri Kåñëa or, in other words,the uninterrupted flow of service to Çré Kåñëa performed in allendeavours of the body, mind and speech and through the ex-pression of various spiritual sentiments ( bhävas ), which is not
covered by jïäna , knowledge of oneness with brahma or nitya and
naimittika-karma , yoga , tapasyä and so forth, and which is devoid
of all desires other than the aspiration to bring happiness toÇré Kåñëa.
This uttamä -bhakti  is certainly the very essence of all
çästras . Famous kevalä  advaita-vädé  commentators, such as
Äcärya Çaìkara, Änandagiri and Madhusüdana Sarasvaté,have stated in their commentaries on this present çloka  that
parä bhakti is bhakti  characterised by jïäna.  But it is worth
noting that the parä bhakti  described in this çloka  is only
achieved after attaining the brahma-bhüta  stage. In other
words, it is achieved by a person who has become situatedon the brahma-bhüta  platform. Parä bhakti  is therefore su-
perior even to the brahma-bhüta  state. It can be easilyÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1065 54
understood that it does not refer to bhakti  which is mixed
with jïäna  and aimed at achieving brahma-jïäna . A person
still needs to acquire tattva-jïäna  of parabrahma Çré Kåñëa,
even after he has attained brahma-jïäna . Thus, a brahma-
jïäné  will achieve tattva-jïäna  of Çré Kåñëa if he has the good
fortune to perform parä bhakti  in the association of bhaktas .
It should be clearly understood here that there is a differ-ence between the parä bhakti ,  which gives knowledge of
kåñëa-tattva ,  and the bhakti  which is used to achieve brahma-
jïäna . The word parä  has been used to clarify this point.
There is a confidential meaning also behind the use of theword labhate  (obtains), instead of the word kurute  (does) .
There is a possibility of achieving parä bhakti  only when a
person has realised the insignificance and inferior nature ofthe brahma-jïäna  attained by a brahma-jïäné.  This takes
place by the causeless mercy of Bhagavän or His bhaktas.  The
word labhate has therefore been used because parä bhakti is
achieved only by the mercy of Bhagavän or His bhaktas . The
word kurute  (does or makes) would have been used if it were
achievable by ones own endeavour; but Çré Bhagavän hasnot used the word kurute . This observation clarifies that the
word parä bhakti  only aims at çuddhä ,  kevalä or ananya-
bhakti  and not at jïäna-miçra-bhakti.
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said that even this brahma-bhüta
stage is external, because one who is situated in that stagecannot realise or attain Goloka or Vaikuëöha although he hasbecome free from the guëas . Goloka or Vaikuëöha can only
be realised when one acquires parä bhakti . Therefore, the
brahma-bhüta  platform is not the highest step. Rather, it is
the initial stage in the process of acquiring that supreme level.
Here it should also be understood that those who acquire
the brahma-bhüta  stage are of two types.  The first type
endeavour for säyujya-mukti , even after they have attained! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1066
the brahma-bhüta  stage. They disregard the bhaktas  of
Bhagavän and Çré Bhagaväns näma , rüpa , guëa  and lélä and
do not listen to hari-kathä . They are offenders and never
achieve mukti  but continue to wander in the bodies of äsurika
species in this material world. The second type respect thebhaktas  as well as Bhagaväns näma , rüpa , guëa  and lélä.
Taking shelter of the bhaktas ,  they easily achieve parä bhakti
due to their non-offensive attitude .

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
What is the result of attaining bhakti to You? Çré
Bhagavän answers this with the çloka beginning with
bhaktyä . Jïänés  and various types of bhaktas  who have at-
tained bhakti understand the tattva  of My opulences and
svarüpa  (tat-padärtha ), and thus enter My nitya-lélä . As I have
also said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.14.21): I am attainableÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1067 55
only by kevala-bhakti.  Thus, the vidyä  of the jïänés  can cease
on the strength of that bhakti  alone. They can enter into
Me and realise the bliss of säyujya  when they come to know
Me in tattva . Because I am beyond mäyä  and since avidyä  is
mäyä , I am known only by vidyä .
The five divisions of vidyä  are stated in the Närada-
païcarätra.  They are: jïäna , yoga, vairägya , tapa and bhakti
to Keçava. Bhakti  is a special function of vidyä . Furthermore,
only a portion of bhakti , which is a function of Çré
Bhagaväns hlädiné-çakti , enters into vidyä  to enable its suc-
cess. Sometimes, a portion of bhakti enters karma  to facili-
tate the success of karma-yoga . The practice of karma , yoga
and jïäna , etc. is simply unnecessary labour without bhakti ,
and does not bear fruit. In truth, bhakti  is nirguëa ,  so it can-
not manifest from vidyä , which is in sattva-guëa.  Ignorance
is removed by vidyä , whereas Çré Bhagavän ( tat-padärtha ) is
known by bhakti . Furthermore, it is said in Gétä (14.17):  Jïäna
arises from sattva-guëa . Therefore, the jïäna  which comes
from sattva-guëa  is also in sattva-guëa . Vidyä refers to  sattva-
jïäna , but the jïäna  arising from bhakti  is bhakti  Herself.
That bhakti  is denoted in some places by the word bhakti ,
and in other places by the word jïäna . In this way, it is nec-
essary to understand that jïäna  is also of two types.
One achieves brahma-säyujya  only after giving up the first
type of jïäna  which manifests from sattva-guëa , and adopt-
ing the second type of jïäna  arising from bhakti . This can
be clearly seen in the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam ,
Chapter Twenty-Five . Some people, who are bereft of bhakti ,
try to attain säyujya  through jïäna . Such persons, who are
proud of their jïäna , unfortunately only become distressed
and are condemned. There are those who understand thatmukti cannot be achieved solely through jïäna. Thus they
engage in some practices of bhakti with their jïäna (jïäna! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1068
miçra-bhakti ). Such persons think that the existence of
Bhagavän is material and temporary, and that His body con-sists of the material guëas . Even after attaining the platform
of yoga called yogärüòha , such persons, who falsely think that
they are liberated, are only worthy of being condemned. Asit is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.5.2): According to their
respective guëas , the four äçramas along with the four varëas ,
originated separately from the mouth, arms, thighs, and feetof the puruña , Bhagavän. Those who disrespect this self-born
puruña , Bhagavän Himself, and do not render service to Him,
fall from their position. This means that those who do notperform bhajana  to Him as well as those who disrespect Him,
even while worshipping Him, fall down after losing theirvidyä ,  even though they are sannyäsés.  Çrémad-Bhägavatam
also states (10.2.32):
ye nye aravindäkña vimukta-mäninas
tvayy asta-bhäväd aviçuddha-buddhayaù
äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù
patanty adho nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù
O Kamala-nayana (lotus-eyed Lord)! One who is falsely proud
of being liberated, and does not perform bhakti  to You due to his
polluted intelligence, falls down because he disrespects Yourlotus feet, even after he has taken great trouble to attain thehighest position of renunciation.
 The word anye  in the above Bhägavatam  çloka refers to a
person other than a bhakta  of Çré Mädhava, and the word
aìghri  refers to bhakti . To disrespect Çré Bhagaväns lotus feet,
therefore, means to disrespect bhakti.
Anädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù means that it is disrespectful
to consider that Çré Bhagaväns body is composed of the threeguëas . This was also stated earlier in Gétä  (9.11): Foolish
people deride Me when I appear in My human form. InÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1069 55
reality, that human form is sac-cid-änanda-maya , composed
of eternality, knowledge and bliss. Only by the influence ofÇré Bhagaväns inconceivable kåpä çakti  does that body be-
come visible. It is said in Näräyaëa-ädhyätma-vacana , Al-
though the svarüpa  of Çré Bhagavän is ever unmanifest, He
becomes visible only by the influence of His own çakti . Who
can see His supremely blissful svarüpa  without the help of
that potency? Thus, the sac-cid-änanda  nature of
Bhagaväns body is established.
Even though hundreds of çruti and småti  statements such
as kliptaà  sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaà  çré våndävana  sura-
bhüruha-taläsénam ,  The Lord is described as He who has a
transcendental form of eternality, cognisance and bliss, andis seated at the base of a desire-tree  (Gopäla-täpini
Upaniñad ), and çäbdaà  brahma  dadhad vapuù ,  The Lord
displayed His transcendental form, which can only be un-derstood through the Vedas . Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.21.8)
further establishes the sac-cid-änanda  nature of Bhagaväns
body, still some conclude that His name, form, qualities, etc.,are materially designated on the basis of one solitary state-ment in the Çvetäçvatara  Upaniñad  (4.10): mäyäà  tu prakåtià
vidyän  mäyinaà  tu maheçvaram.  The phenomema of ma-
terial nature is mäyä  (a temporary illusion),  and Parameçvara
is mayé , made up of mäyä. However, there is a çruti state-
ment quoted in Çré Madhva-bhäñya , ato mäyämayaà  viñëuà
pravadanti  sanätanam ,  Therefore, they declare Çré Viñëu,
the eternal supreme Lord to be mäyämaya , constituted of
mäyä.  According to this statement, Bhagavän is eternally
endowed with an internal potency called svarüpa-bhüta-
mäyä ,  which is part of His own svarüpa . In the word mäyäà
tu, in this çloka from Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad ,  mäyä  refers to
His svarüpa-bhüta ,  cit or conscious potency,  which originates
from His svarüpa . It does not refer to the material energy! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1070
consist ing of the guëas ,  which is not part of His svarüpa.  How-
ever, they do not accept this meaning. They do not even acceptthe interpretation that mäyä  is the prakåti  and Maheçvara or
Çambhu Çiva is the master of that mäyä . Therefore, they fall
down due to their offensive attitude to Bhagavän, even afterattaining the state of jévan  mukta , liberation while living within
this material body. It is also said in the supplementary state-ment of Väsanä-bhäñya , that even a person who is jévan  mukta
becomes entrenched in material lusty desires and again has toenter saàsära  if he somehow offends the inconceivable, su-
premely powerful Bhagavän. When he has attained the resultof his practice, he thinks that the means are of no further use;hence he falls down. Therefore, in the stage of jïäna -sannyäsa ,
he abandons not only jïäna , but guëébhütä bhakti  (bhakti  which
is present in jïäna  to some degree). Thus he maintains the false
conception that he is experiencing direct realisation of brahma .
Because he commits offenses to the çré-vigraha  of Bhagavän,
bhakti  also disappears along with jïäna ,  and he is not able to
attain bhakti  again. Without bhakti , the Supreme Absolute Truth
cannot be realised . It should be understood that the meditation
such a person performs at that time is useless, and his pride inbeing jévan  mukta , liberated while in this body, should also be
recognised as baseless.
Supporting this view, Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.2.32) states:
ye nye aravindäkña  vimukta-mäninaù.  There are two types
of jévan  muktas  who properly engage in the practice of
bhakti-miçra-jïäna  (jïäna  mixed with bhakti ). Both of them
recognise the çré-mürti  of Bhagavän to be sac-cid-änanda-
mayé ,  and they achieve parä bhakti  after gradually giving
up vidyä  and avidyä.  The first perform bhakti  with the aim
of attaining säyujya , becoming one with Him. With the as-
sistance of this bhakti ,  they achieve tat-padärtha , direct re-
alisation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, thus attaining one-ness with Him. Those individuals are worthy of honour. InÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1071 55
the second group are highly fortunate persons who give up
the desire for mukti  and remain absorbed in tasting the
sweetness of bhakti-rasa  by the influence of the associa-
tion of calm and composed mahä-bhägavatas  like Çukadeva
Gosvämé . Such personalities are to be most highly honoured.
As it is said in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.7.10): The qualities
of Çré Hari are so wonderful that even the great munis  who
are ätmäräma , and who have completely cut the knot of
avidyä , are attracted by His attracting potency. Hence, they
perform selfless bhakti  to Urukrama Çré Kåñëa, who per-
forms wonderful feats.
Therefore, out of these four types of jïänés , the first two are
worthy of reproach and they remain bound, while the othertwo are respectable and cross beyond the material world.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the present çloka ,  Çré Bhagavän is explaining the result
of parä bhakti  (kevala-bhakti  characterised by prema ). By
some good fortune, by the mercy of a great personality, aperson who has achieved the stage of brahma-bhüta  attains
parä bhakti.  At that time, he loses his desire for mokña.  Hav-
ing become free from jïäna ,  he achieves nirguëä bhakti  and
realises kåñëa-tattva.  This takes place when he realises his
svarüpa-siddhi. Then, at the time of attaining vastu-siddhi ,
he enters into the pastimes of Bhagavän. It is stated inÇrémad-Bhägavatam (1.7.10):
ätmärämäç ca munayo / nirgranthä apy urukrame
kurvanty ahaitukém bhaktim/ itthaà-bhüta-guëo hariù
Those ätmärämas  who are very fortunate can become attracted
by the qualities of Çré Bhagavän if they receive the causelessmercy of Çré Bhagavän and His bhaktas.  They can then become
absorbed in relishing the sweetness of bhakti-rasa  by engaging
in ahaituké bhakti to Him.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1072
 The examples are the four Kumäras, who received the
mercy of Bhagavän, and Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé, who receivedthe mercy of Çré Vyäsadeva.
In Gétä çlokas , such as 11.54, 8.14 and 9.22, it is stated that
Çré Bhagavän can only be attained by bhakti . Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.14.21) also states: bhaktyäham  ekayä  grähyaù.
Only by pure devotional service am I to be known. Whileanswering the questions of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, RäyaRämänanda said that bhakti  which is free from jïäna ,  is
the essence of all perfection. But Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhudid not even accept this as the highest goal of life, and re-quested him to explain further. At this point, Çré RäyaRämänanda prabhu presented a Bhägavatam  çloka  as evi-
dence: jïäne  prayäsam  udapäsya . This çloka  states that not
all perfected and liberated persons can realise kåñëa-tattva .
This has been discussed in the çlokas , manuñyäëäà  sahasreñu ,
Only an extremely rare person comes to know Me in truth
(Gétä  7.3), muktänäm  api siddhänäm ,  Among millions of
liberated souls, only one knows Me in truth ( Çrémad-
Bhägavatam : 6.14.5), and koöi-mukta-madhye  durlabha  eka
kåñëa-bhakta ,  Among millions of souls who are actually
liberated, it is very difficult to find one who is My pure bhakta 
(Caitanya-caritämåta  Madhya-lélä  19.148).
Çästras  such as the çrutis , småtis , Vedänta-sütra , Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  and the Gétä give numerous proofs to show that
even after a jéva has achieved mukti ,  he can become situ-
ated in his own pure constitutional svarüpa  and taste the bliss
of service to Çré Bhagavän. In Çréla Çrédhara Svämés Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  commentary called Dhåta-sarvajïa-bhäñya-kära ,
he has commented on çloka 10.87.21 as follows: muktä  api
lélayä  vigrahaà  kåtvä  bhagavantaà  bhajante.  Even the lib-
erated beings constantly render voluntary service toBhagavän with their transcendental ( apräkåta ) bodies. InÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1073 55
the çrutis ,  we find references such as äpräyaëät  taträpi  hi
òåñöam ,  What one does throughout ones life is evident at
the time of death ( Brahma-sütra  4.1.12), and mokñe  ca bhaktir
anuvarttate , that describe the presence of bhakti , even in the
state of mokña .
Viçate  tad anantaram  (Gétä 18.55) has a deeper, more con-
fidential meaning. Having known and realised Bhagavän,one does not enter into Him and become one with Him, butrather one enters into His lélä. For example, when a person
enters a city, or a bird enters its nest, it does not mean thatthe person becomes the city, or that the bird becomes thenest. The actual meaning is that they enjoy great happi-ness in meeting with their family members. The nirviçeña-
vädés  normally use the example of rivers flowing into the
ocean to express the oneness of the jéva with brahma. They
say that, just as the rivers lose their name and form whenthey merge into the ocean (having given up their separate
existence), in the same way, the jéva merges with brahma
and becomes one with Him. However, the saviçeña-vädé
bhaktas  say that, even after mukti , a pure jéva maintains
his own individual existence, just as the aquatics living inthe ocean have their separate existence from the ocean.Living beings live happily in the ocean with their familymembers. To know the ocean, mere knowledge of theoceans surface is not adequate. It is necessary also to knowthe various aquatics that live deep down in the ocean, aswell as the pearls, jewels and various types of useful minesthere. Similarly, to know Svayaà Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, asHe who is complete with six opulences and full of bhakti-
rasa, is to know Him in tattva  and in full. Only when a
sädhaka  or bhäva-bhakta  has attained this knowledge can
he then enter into the lélä of Bhagavän in his state of vastu-
siddhi  and taste the bliss of rendering sevä to Him.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1074
If one deeply deliberates on the statements of çästra , it
becomes clear that one cannot attain mukti  merely by jïäna ,
without the help of bhakti : çreyaù  såtià  bhaktim  udasya ,  I
can be attained by bhakti alone, not by speculative knowl-
edge ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  10.14.4). The jïänés  are of two
types: the kevala-jïäné  (who cultivates jïäna  only) and the
bhakti-miçra-jïäné  (who mixes bhakti  with his cultivation
of jïäna ).
Bhakti-miçra-jïänés  are also of two types: those who con-
sider the form of Bhagavän as illusory, and those who ac-cept the form of Bhagavän as sac-cid-änanda . The first cat-
egory of jïänés  do not become mukta  (liberated) because of
their offence at the lotus feet of Bhagavän. They only main-tain a false ego of being liberated. Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(10.2.32) makes the following statement about such jïänés
who are falsely proud and think that they are liberated:
ye nye aravindäkña vimukta-mäninas
tvayy astabhäväd aviçuddha buddhayaù
äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù
patanty adho anädåta yuñmad-aìghrayaù
O Kamala-locana (lotus-eyed Bhagavän)! He who has cultivated
jïäna and who is falsely proud calls himself liberated. It should
be understood that he possesses a polluted intelligence becausehe has no conception that bhakti  is an eternal activity. In his
cultivation of jïäna , he has given up material objects ( atat)
through the process of negation and only reaches a supremeposition near tat, the Absolute Reality, where he remains stag-
nant. However, because he has failed to attain the shelter of Yourlotus feet, he eventually falls down.
 Gétä  (9.12) also states:
moghäçä mogha-karmäëo / mogha-jïänä vicetasaù
räkñasém äsuréà caiva / prakåtià mohiném çritäùÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1075 56
With frustrated hopes, futile actions, ineffectual knowledge and
a distracted mind, he only takes shelter of an illusory, tämasika
and äsurika  nature.
The second type of jïäné  who follows the path of bhakti-
miçra-jïäna  accepts the çré-mürti  of Bhagavän as sac-cid-
änanda-mayé.  Such a jïäné  attains säyujya-mukti  after his
vidyä  and avidyä  has been removed, but he does not attain
parä bhakti.  Some of these jïänés have the good fortune to
receive the mercy of a mahä-puruña.  They are able to give
up the desire for mukti ,  and thus attain parä bhakti . The

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
It was explained earlier that a jïäné  ultimately achieves
the result of My säyujya  by gradually giving up the results of
karma.  He then gives up the karma  itself and finally he aban-
dons jïäna . But how can My bhaktas  attain Me? To explain
this, Sri Bhagavan is speaking this çloka  beginning with sarva.
If even those who are specifically sakäma ,  and who main-
tain inferior desires can attain the supreme destination bytaking shelter of Me, then what to speak of those who areniñkäma-bhaktas ? And furthermore, what can be said about
the destinations of ananya-bhaktas  who give up their adher-
ence to karma , yoga, jïäna  and the worship of various devas ,
as well as all other material desires and worship Me exclu-sively, although engaged in all types of karma ,  such as nitya
and naimittika , as well as fruitive or social activities for the
maintenance of sons, daughters and so on?
Here the statement äçrayate  (takes shelter) means that he
performs sevä properly and wholeheartedly. The prefix äì to
the word çraya certainly implies the predominance of sevä.
The word api (also) in the phrase karmaëy  api indicates the
inferiority of karma , thereby implying that karma  is secondary
for such people. In other words, these people perform bhakti
which is mixed with karma , not karma  which is mixed with
bhakti. This means that they are not excessively engrossed
in the karma  which was described in the first six chapters.
The words çäçvataà  padam  mean, They attain My eternalÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1077 57
abodes such as Vaikuëöha, Mathurä, Dvärakä and Ayodhyä.
But how will these abodes survive the mahä-pralaya , total
annihilation? In response to this, Çré Bhagavän says avyayam.
My abodes are not destroyed during the complete annihila-tion; they remain unaffected. This is possible only by theinfluence of My inconceivable potency.
One may raise the following doubt: On the one hand, a
jïäné  attains säyujya  after achieving the state of
naiñkarmya , action without reaction. This occurs as a re-
sult of his giving up all sense enjoyments, as well as under-going great pains in the performance of austerities and soforth for many lifetimes. Your bhaktas , however, attain Your
eternal abode, even though they are engaged in karma  with
material desires. Does this occur merely by taking shelterof You? In response to this Çré Bhagavän says, This takesplace by My mercy. Know that the influence of My sweetwill is beyond reason.
S

This çloka  illustrates the speciality of bhakti  and of a
bhakta . The heart becomes progressively purified as a result
of performing niñkäma-karma  as an offering to Bhagavän,
and gradually one attains jïäna . Such jïänés  then become
qualified to attain bhakti to Me. By My causeless mercy,
however, My aikäntika-bhaktas  can attain My supreme abode
in any state, simply by taking shelter of ananya-bhakti . My
aikäntika-bhaktas  are not bound by the results of any karma ,
even while performing nitya  (obligatory), naimittika  (causal)
and kämya  (fruitive) activities. By My mercy, they quickly
attain My eternal abodes such as Vaikuëöha and Goloka.This indicates the supremely merciful nature of Bhagavän
in relation to His aikäntika-bhaktas.  Bhagavän Himself says
in Gétä  (9.30): api cet su-duräcäro  bhajate  mäm  ananya-bhäk.! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1078
Even if a mans conduct is most abominable, if he engages
in My ananya-bhakti , he should be accepted as a bhakta .
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, It
has been explained that the confidential path to attain Meis by the Vedic process of first performing niñkäma-karma-
yoga  by which one attains jïäna.  Bhakti  is then attained
through that jïäna . This is the first of the three processes
I am lucidly describing. Now, please listen as I explain howI am attained by the second process, namely worship of Me.It is by My mercy that a person finally attains nirguëa-
bhakti , the imperishable and eternal position. This occurs
when he takes exclusive shelter of Me, even in anunfavourable manner because of his material desires. He stilloffers all of his activities to Me however, considering Meto be Éçvara.

So what are You finally ordering me to do? Do you want
me to become an ananya-bhakta ,  or a sakäma-bhakta ,  pos-

Bhagavän responds to Arjunas question as follows: You willnot be able to become the topmost bhakta ,  nor should you
become the inferior type of sakäma-bhakta . Rather, you
should become a madhyama-bhakta (a bhakta situated in the
intermediate stage). Çré Bhagavän speaks this çloka  begin-

karmäëi  indicates, You should become a niñkäma-bhakta  by
offering all your activites to Me, whether they are related toäçrama -dharma  or to varëa-dharma . I am the only goal of

Here, Arjuna wants to clearly understand the obligations of
a bhakta  whose adhikära  is to practise bhakti  on the interme-

O Arjuna, Sarväntaryämé Paramätmä is situated in the heart

SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän is now giving His own conclusion, having
explained the opinion of the svabhäva-vädés  (those who
worship the tendencies born of their natures) in the previ-ous two çlokas . Çré Näräyaëa is Antaryämé, who dwells
within all jévas. Båhad-äraëyaka  Upaniñad  (3.6.3) states that
He resides within the earth but the earth does not know Him.The earth is His body and by residing within the earth, Hecontrols and moves it. The çrutis also state: Çré Näräyaëa
pervades whatever is seen or heard in this universe, what-ever is within or beyond it. From these Vedic statements, itis established that Éçvara is situated within the heart asAntaryämé. What does He do there? In response to this, ÇréBhagavän says, He makes all the jévas wander within this
material world by His mäyä-çakti , engaging them in various
activities. Just as a puppeteer manoeuvres puppets that aremounted on a platform by a device which controls thethreads, similarly, mäyä  controls all the jévas in a particular
way. Yanträrüòhäni  also means the jévas who are situated in
various bodies.

Parameçvara is the Supersoul of the entire moving and non-
moving world. He has already stated this earlier in Gétä (15.15):
sarvasya  cähaà  hådi sanniviñöo . I am seated within everyones
heart; all remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness comefrom Me alone.
The çrutis also say:

He is omnipresent and omnipotent. Under His control the jéva,
influenced by mäyä , is wandering throughout this material
world, riding the machine of the subtle and gross body.
Some think that Éçvara controls all beings and prompts their
actions. Therefore, all of our good and bad actions are performedby His inspiration. They presume that the jéva is just like a pup-
pet. Therefore, they think, instead of the jéva getting the results
of all his good and bad works, Éçvara alone should and, in fact,does receive the results. But such understanding is completely
illusory. One should properly appreciate the meaning of the word
yanträrüòhäni . Those jévas who are averse to Bhagavän are given
a subtle and a gross body by mäyä  according to the impressions
of their karma , which have accumulated since time immemo-
rial. The jéva wanders throughout the cycle of karma , riding on
the body given to him according to his previous actions. Thistakes place on the inspiration of Éçvara, under the control ofmäyä.  Éçvara does not directly engage the bound jévas in their
karma . The baddha-jéva  does not want to give up his indepen-
dence completely and be controlled by Bhagavän; therefore, hedoes not receive this good fortune. Thus, Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu clearly states in Caitanya-caritämåta , (Madhya-
lélä 20.117):
kåñëa bhüli sei jéva anädi-bahirmukha
ataeva mäyä täre deya saàsära-duùkha
Having forgotten Kåñëa, the jéva has been attracted by mäyä  since
time immemorial. Thus, mäyä  gives him all kinds of misery in
his material existence.
Parameçvara merely acts as a witness to such rebellious jévas,! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1086
and through mäyä  He makes them undergo the results of all
their good and bad activities. In the case of His bhaktas ,
however, He does not remain indifferent towards them likea witness, but rather He engages them in His service. This isHis great mercy.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, I
alone am situated in the heart of all jévas  as Paramätmä,
and Paramätmä is indeed, the controller and master of alljévas . Éçvara gives the jévas the fruit of whatever activi-
ties they perform. Just as an object that is situated on amachine rotates, similarly, the jévas  continue to wander
in the material world, as arranged by the all-controllingquality of Éçvara. According to your previous karma , your
nature will continue to function by the inspiration ofÉçvara.

who have acquired a duration of life equivalent to that ofBrahmä, and who blissfully remember You, always feel in-debted to You. This is because You illuminate the embodiedentities with the process of attaining You. You do this exter-nally as äcärya-guru  and internally as caitya-guru .

vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaà / yaj jïänam advayam
brahmeti paramätmeti / bhagavän iti çabdyate
Those who are tattva-vit  realise that non-dual Absolute Truth
in three aspects. Brahma  only has the characteristic of cit or
consciousness and is the first realisation (manifestation) of thattattva.  Paramätmä, the extension of that cit consciousness, is the
second manifestation, and Bhagavän, who manifests as cid-
viläsa-rüpa  (He who performs transcendental amorous pastimes),
is the third realisation of that tattva . That tattva  is known by
three names in these three states.
These three manifestations of Vrajendra-nandana Kåñëa
are brahma , Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Of these, realisation
of brahma  (the effulgence emanating from His body) is the
perverted reflection of the cid-aàça , the conscious part of
the para-tattva.  This is called incomplete realisation.
Paramätmä realisation is a partial realisation of sat and cit,
and Bhagavän realisation is the complete realisation of theAbsolute in the form of sat, cit and änanda . Here brahma-
jïäna  is called confidential ( guhya ), paramätma-jïäna  more
confidential ( guhyatara ) and bhagavat-jïäna  the most con-
fidential ( guhyatama ).
This most confidential bhagavat-jïäna  also has three di-
visions: Çré Kåñëa is complete in Dvärakä, more complete inMathurä and most complete in Våndävana or Gokula.Arjuna, who is a friend of Kåñëa in His pastimes in Dvärakä,only knows His complete feature.
There are eighteen chapters in the Gétä  and they are di-
vided into three divisions of six chapters. The first six chap-ters describe niñkäma-karma-yoga  which is offered to
Bhagavän. The second six chapters describe bhakti-yoga  and
the third six chapters describe jïäna-yoga . One should not
think that jïäna-yoga  is the highest and final conclusion justÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1091 64
because it comes at the end. Rather, the hidden meaning is
that bhakti-yoga , which is situated in between karma-yoga
and jïäna-yoga , gives strength to them both, thus making
karma and jïäna qualified to give their results. Karma-yoga
and jïäna-yoga  are useless without the shelter of bhakti . In
this way, the Gétä is like a box, its base is karma-yoga , its upper
lid is jïäna-yoga  and the great wealth of Bhakti-devé is situ-
ated like a precious gem within. In this way, people in gen-eral can understand that the first six chapters are confiden-tial, the last six chapters are more confidential and the middlesix chapters are the most confidential.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying,
Brahma-jïäna , which was explained to you earlier, is a se-
cret. Paramätma-jïäna , which is explained now, is more se-
cret. Reflect on this thoroughly and do as you wish. Thismeans that if you want to achieve brahma  by taking shelter
of jïäna  through niñkäma -karma-yoga  and gradually achieve
My nirguëa-bhakti , then perform your actions in this battle
as niñkäma-karma . And if you want to surrender to
Paramätmä, then engage in battle while offering your actionsto Éçvara, performing the occupation which is born of yourkñatriya  nature, as prompted by Him. Then Éçvara, who is
My avatära ,  will gradually bestow nirguëa-bhakti  upon you .
Whatever your conclusion, understand that to fight is cer-tainly beneficial for you.

When Çré Kåñëa saw that His dear friend Arjuna had
fallen silent while deliberating on the deep and grave mean-ings of this Gétä-çästra , His heart, which is as soft as but-

will speak the very essence of all çästra  to you in these con-
cluding eight çlokas . If Arjuna asks, Why will You take
further trouble to explain this? then in answer ÇréBhagavän speaks this çloka  beginning with the words sarva-
guhyatamam . I am again giving you the essence of the Ninth

Çré Gétä is called an Upaniñad . It is the essence of the Vedas
and of the Upaniñads . One can only understand its inner-
most intention by the mercy of Bhagavän and His bhaktas .
These confidential instructions cannot be understood merelyon the strength of ones intelligence, nor through the mediumof karmés , jïänés , or non-devotees who consider the form of
Bhagavän to be illusory and devoid of potency. Only theexclusive, fully surrendered bhaktas  of Kåñëa can, by His grace,
become aware of these most confidential instructions. Thisçloka  is spoken by Çré Bhagavän for the explicit purpose of
explaining this secret.
Arjuna is Çré Kåñëas full aikäntika-bhakta , and is very dear
to Him. He is, therefore, qualified to hear this most confi-dential instruction. In the same way, only aikäntika-kåñëa-
bhaktas  are capable of comprehending this most secret in-
struction of the Gétä , not others. The aikäntika-bhaktas  are
exclusively surrendered to Kåñëa, knowing Him to be sac-cid-
änanda-parabrahma , and are thus actively engaged in fol-
lowing His instructions and directions, being freed from anydoubt or controversy.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, I spoke
guhya  (confidential) brahma-jïäna  to you, and guhyatara
(more confidential) éçvara-jïäna . Now, I am instructing
guhyatama  (most confidential) bhagavat-jïäna . Please listen.
This is superior to all the other instructions I have given inthis Gétä-çästra . I am imparting it to you for your eternal

Man-manä  bhava  means that you should meditate on

Man-manä  bhava means to absorb ones mind in Kåñëa
exclusively. Çré Kåñëa Himself has accepted the gopés  as the
highest ideal of man-manä  bhava devotees and expresses
this to Uddhava in sweet words ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam
10.46.4-6):

Dear Uddhava, the minds of the gopés  are always absorbed in Me.
I am their very life and their all-in-all. It is for My sake alonethat they have relinquished everything, including their homes,husbands, sons, relatives, shyness, dharmika  principles and so
forth. They constantly remain absorbed in thoughts of Mealone. It is by their trust in My statement, I will come, that theyare maintaining their lives somehow or other, with great diffi-culty, and are waiting for Me.
This description of the gopés  who are feeling anxiety in
separation from Kåñëa is the highest example of man-manä
bhava . Now hear about a  gopés absorption in Kåñëa while
she was in pürva-räga , that state prior to meeting with
Him.
Once, a newly married gopé came to live in Nandagäon.
This gopé had heard of Kåñëas name and His supremely
attractive and wonderful activities, yet she had never had
the good fortune to see Him directly. Every day, Kåñëa playedon His flute as He entered the forest to tend the cows withHis friends. Hearing the sound of His flute-playing, all theresidents of Vraja would gather on the royal path, being veryeager to see the unparalleled sweetness of His beauty. Somestood on the balconies and some climbed trees. Some stoodnear the path and some peeped through windows. Thatnewly-married gopé also longed to go there and see Kåñëa,
but her mother-in-law forbade her, saying, That black snakeout there will bite you, so it is not proper for you to go.
The newly-wedded bride argued, Your daughter has gone
there, so why are you not allowing me to go? But the mother-in-law still did not give her permission.
Despite this restriction, the gopé went to a bush near the
royal path and stood behind it. In this way, she could seeKåñëa. Understanding her mind, Kåñëa slightly twisted thetail of a calf who started running and jumping over to thatÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1097 65
new gopé and stood near her. Kåñëa ran after the calf and
arrived at the same spot. Standing there for a moment in Hisbeautiful tribhaìga-lalita  form, He touched the chin of that
gopé with His flute, and then ran off to rejoin His friends.
The new gopé, now absorbed in the sweetness of Kåñëas
beautiful form, lost her external consciousness and remainedstanding there, motionless, as Kåñëa entered the forest.
A considerable amount of time passed by. Her mother-
in-law came searching for her when she did not return home.Shaking the gopés body, her mother-in-law cried, What I
feared has happened! You have been bitten by that blacksnake. She brought the gopi back to the house and ordered
her to make buttermilk from yogurt kept in a clay pot. Thebride still had not regained her external consciousness, soshe took a pot full of mustard seeds instead and began tochurn them, mistaking it for the pot of yogurt. Because shehad not returned to her external consciousness, she would
sometimes churn the mustard seeds and sometimes not, so
sometimes there was a harsh sound and sometimes nosound. When the mother-in-law noticed this, she stoppedher from churning and instead ordered her to bring waterfrom the well. Placing three pots on her head, one on topof the other and giving her a rope to hold in one hand anda little baby to hold in the other, she sent her for water.The bride went to the well and prepared the rope to haulwater, but because she was not in her natural state of mind,she began to tie the rope around the neck of the baby. Theother gopés ,  who had come there to fetch water, stopped
her, crying out, Alas, alas! What has happened to her? Itseems that she is possessed by a ghost! Some gopés  who
knew the reality of the situation said, No, she is not pos-sessed by a ghost, but by the son of Nanda Mahäräja. Thisis an example of man-manä  bhava .! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1098
The instruction, mad-bhakto  bhava , is given for those
who cannot become as absorbed in Kåñëa as the gopés can.
Mad-bhakto  bhava  means to offer oneself in all respects
unto the lotus feet of Bhagavän. How can a bhakta ren-
der service continuously? In this regard, the story ofPrahläda has been described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(7.5.23-24):
çré-prahläda uväca
çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù / smaraëaà päda-sevanam
arcanaà vandanaà däsyaà / sakhyam ätma-nivedanam
iti puàsärpitä viñëau / bhaktiç cen nava-lakñaëä
kriyeta bhagavaty addhä / tan manye dhétam uttamam
Prahläda Mahäräja said, O my dear father, bhakti  to Çré Viñëu
is performed in nine ways: hearing, chanting and remember-ing His name, form, qualities, pastimes, etc., rendering serviceto His lotus feet, worshipping Him, praying to Him, servingHim, making friendship with Him and surrendering ones selfto Him . If these nine types of bhakti  are performed to Bhagavän
in a mood of surrender, then I consider that to be the best ofall education.
Mahäräja Ambaréña is the illuminating example of com-
plete surrender. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (9.4.18-20) describes
how he performed bhakti  to Kåñëa.

He fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëacandra, his speech
in glorifying the qualities of Bhagavän, his hands in cleansingthe temple of Çré Hari and his ears in hearing the auspiciouspastimes of Bhagavän Acyuta. He engaged his eyes in seeing theçré mürti  and the temples of Mukunda, his body and limbs in
touching the bodies of His bhaktas , his nose in smelling the tran-
scendental fragrance of Tulasé offered at His feet, and his tonguein honouring the prasäda  which had been offered to Bhagavän.
He utilised his feet for walking to the holy abodes of Bhagavän,and his head in offering obeisances to the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa.He offered all paraphernalia, such as garlands and sandalwood,in the service of Bhagavän. He did all this, not to acquire mate-rial enjoyment, but to attain bhagavat-prema  which only resides
in the bhaktas  of Bhagavän, glorification of whom purifies ev-
eryone.
Bilvamaìgala is an example of a bhakta  belonging to this
class. He was born in a village on the bank of the Kåñëä-veëëä River in South India. He was a great scholar of theVedas  and Vedänta , yet he was very much attached to a pros-
titute named Cintämaëi. One evening it was raining heavily,but his desire to meet Cintämaëi made him so restless thathe set out to meet her, not caring for the bad weather. Onthe way, he had to cross a river, which on that terrifying nightwas flooded and looked like the very form of death. Becausethere were no means to cross that river, in desperationBilvamaìgala crossed it using a floating corpse. When hereached Cintämaëis home, her gate was closed. A snake washanging from her boundary wall and Bilvamaìgala used itto scale the wall mistaking it for a rope. While climbing down! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1100
the other side of the wall, however, he slipped and fell to the
ground, making a loud crash, and lost consciousness. Hear-ing that sound, Cintämaëi and her friends ran out to see whathad happened. Flashes of lightning illuminating the sceneenabled her to recognise Bilvamaìgala, and she understoodeverything. Reproaching herself, Cintämaëi chastisedBilvamaìgala severely. If only you were as attached to thelotus feet of Çré Kåñëa as you are to me, then certainly youwould become a supremely blessed man.
Bilvamaìgala heard the heart-piercing words of Cintämäëé
as he regained consciousness. At that very moment, he sawthe folly of his activities and immediately decided to end hissinful ways and journey on foot to Våndävana. As he pro-ceeded on his way, he felt thirsty, so when he passed a vil-lage where he saw a young woman hauling water from a well,he went there to quench his thirst. When he saw the beautyof that young woman, however, he became attracted to her.
He even followed the woman to her home.
The husband of the woman, assuming Bilvamaìgala to be
a saint by his dress and demeanor, showed him respect andinvited him to accept a seat inside his home. Bilvamaìgalarequested the man to call his wife. On the call of her husband,that woman came out, and Bilvamaìgala asked her for hertwo hairpins. Taking those hairpins, Bilvamaìgala immedi-ately pierced both his eyes with them. As he did this, he la-mented grievously, crying out, These eyes have become thecause of my degraded wretched condition, being attracted bytheir sense objects in the form of beautiful women. Where thereis no cause there can be no effect! Having thus lost his eye-sight, and with blood flowing profusely from his eyes, he againstarted for Våndävana. But now, his he art had become purified.
After only walking a short distance, a boy came to him and ina very sweet voice asked, O Bäbä ,  where are you going?ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1101 65
Bilvamaìgala replied, I am going to Våndävana.
The boy said, I am also going to Våndävana. Please hold
on to My stick. That boy was none other than Muralé-Manohara Çré Kåñëa Himself, who captivates the mind byplaying His muralé  flute.
Mad-yäjé  means to perform My arcana . The niñöhä (steady
practice) of arcana  is on a slightly lower level than that of
mad-bhakto.  Çré Bhagavän therefore, says that if you can-
not be a bhakta  (mad-bhakto ) like Bilvamaìgala, then perform
My arcana . What should be the niñöhä  of one who performs
arcana to Çré Bhagavän? To illustrate this, I will relate a story
from our own experience that took place here in Mathurä,India.
There used to be a bäbä  (saintly person) in Mathurä who
performed arcana  of his çälagräma-çilä  with great niñöhä . He
did not have complete knowledge of the various limbs ofarcana , but whatever arcana he performed, he did with niñöhä.
He had taken a vow to bathe in Yamunä every day during
brahma-muhürta , and to worship his çälagräma  with Yamunä
water only. Once, on the amävasyä  (new-moon day) in the
month of Mägha, the cold winter month from mid-Januaryto mid-February, it rained the entire night and a heavy coldwind blew. On that pitch-dark morning he had no idea ofthe time because no stars were visible in the sky. He wokelong before the brahma-muhürta  hour and set out to take his
bath. Although Yamunäs waters were as cold as ice and hewas shivering due to the extreme cold, he nevertheless tookbath just to maintain his vow. He then started back for hishome, carrying the Yamunä water for his worship. He facedsevere difficulty because of the dense darkness, heavy rainand the weak condition of his shivering body. He was anx-iously wondering how it would be possible to return home toworship his Deity when, suddenly, he saw somebody holding! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1102
a lantern coming towards him. As the person came closer,
he saw that it was a young boy carrying a blanket on Hishead to protect Him from the rain. Coming close to thebäbä the boy asked,  Bäbä , where are you going? When
the man told Him where he lived, the boy said, I am alsogoing that way. Come with Me and I will take you to yourhouse. He started walking with that boy and reached hishouse very quickly. Just as he was about to enter, he thought,Let me ask this boy His name. But what a wonder! Thebäbä could not see Him anywhere. He looked all around but
there was no trace of Him. Standing there like a stone, helamented, Alas! That chaliyä  (transcendental cheater)
Himself came to protect my vow, and upon cheating me,He has gone away.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (6.3.29) illustrates the meaning of
mäà  namaskuru with Yamaräjas instructions to the
Yamadütas:
jihvä na vakti bhagavad-guëa-nämadheyaà
cetaç ca na smarati tac-caraëäravindam
kåñëäya no namati yac-chira ekadäpi
tän änayadhvam asato kåta-viñëu-kåtyän
O Yamadütas, bring me only those sinful people whose tongues
do not chant the name of Kåñëa, whose minds do not rememberthe lotus feet of Kåñëa, and whose heads have not bowed evenonce before Çré Kåñëa, because they have never performed asingle act of bhakti .
Daçäçvamedhi  punar  eti janma  kåñëa-praëämé  na punar
bhaväya.  A person who performs ten açvamedha-yajïas  has
to take birth again, but those who offer obeisances to Kåñëaeven once never take birth again.
Sakåt praëämé  kåñëasya  mätuù stanyaà  piben  nahi.  One
who bows down to Kåñëa does not have to drink a mothersbreast-milk again.ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1103 66
While explaining the word namaù  in Bhakti-sandarbha
(169), Çréla Jéva Gosvämé writes vandanaà  namaskäram.
Akrüra attained bhakti  to Kåñëa by paying obeisances.
The Skanda-Puräëa  describes the glory of paying obeisances
in the following way:
çäöhyepi namaskäraà kurvataù çärìga-dhanvine
çata janmärjitaà päpaà tat-kñaëäd eva naçyati
Even if one deceitfully bows down to Çré Viñëu, who carries in
His hand the bow called çärìga , his sins accumulated from one
hundred lives are immediately destroyed.

Should I perform activities such as meditation ( dhyäna )
on You and fulfil my äçrama-dharma as well, or should I

Renouncing all types of varëäçrama-dharma , take exclusive

as sannyäsa  (complete renunciation of karma ) because, as a
kñatriya , Arjuna did not have the adhikära  to take sannyäsa .
Someone may ask that, if Kåñëa is making Arjuna an instru-ment in His teachings to show that Arjuna does not havethe adhikära  to take sannyäsa ,  is He, in fact, indicating that
this instruction regarding sannyäsa  is for common people who
may consider that they have that adhikära , and not for
Arjuna, who was a kñatriya ? In answer to this, it is said that,

Arjuna, who is the prime object of Kåñëas instructions, itwould be applicable to all others, and not otherwise. Further-more, it is also not proper to translate the word parityajya  to
mean renouncing the fruits of ones activities. Çrémad-
Bhägavatam  (11.5.41) states:
devarñi-bhütäpta-nåëäà pitåëäà
na kiìkaro näyam åëé ca räjan
sarvätmanä yaù çaraëaà çaraëyaà
gato mukundaà parihåtya kartam
One who gives up the false ego of being the doer, and accepts
the shelter of the supreme shelter Çré Mukunda within the coreof his being ( ätmä ), becomes free from any obligations to the
devas , åñis, living entities, family members and forefathers.
Çrémad -Bhägavatam  (11.29.34) also states:
martyo yadä tyakta-samasta-karmä
niveditätmä vicikérñito me
tadämåtatvaà pratipadyamäno
 mayätma-bhüyäya ca kalpate vai
When a person renounces all types of karma and completely
surrenders himself unto Me, by My will he becomes more opu-lent than a yogé or a jïäné . And in the course of time, when heÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1105 66
has attained immortality ( mukti ), he becomes qualified to attain
opulences like My own.
Another çloka from  Çrémad -Bhägavatam  (11.20.9) states:
tävat karmäëi kurvéta / na nirvidyeta yävatä
mat-kathä-çravaëädau vä / çraddhä yävan na jäyate
Until a person develops detachment from sense objects and attains
faith in hearing narrations about Me, he should continue to per-form his nitya  (obligatory) and naimittika  (incidental) duties.
Also, in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.11.32) it says:
äjïäyaivaà guëän doñän / mayädiñöän api svakän
dharmän santyajya yaù sarvän / mäà bhajeta sa tu sattamaù
Those who render service unto Me, having abandoned all types
of dharma , and having understood the inherent positive and
negative aspects of the prescribed duties instructed by Me inthe Vedas , are counted among the best of sädhus .
It is necessary to explain the meaning of this Gétä çloka  in
accordance with the above profound statements of ÇréBhagavän, and to reconcile their meanings. The word pari
(parityaja ) indicates that the highest objective of these in-
structions is not to renounce the fruits of karma.  Rather, it
means that you should take absolute shelter of Me, and notsurrender to dharma , jïäna , yoga or any of the devas . Previ-
ously, it was stated that you do not have the adhikära  to
perform My supreme ananya-bhakti . Therefore, I have de-
scribed that your adhikära  is to perform karma-miçrä bhakti
in statements such as yat karoñi  yad açnäsi  (Gétä 9.26) . Now,
however, by My boundless and causeless mercy, I am bestowingupon you the adhikära  to perform ananya-bhakti . This
ananya-bhakti  is attained by some great fortune, only by the
mercy of My aikäntika-bhaktas . This is My vow. But I am
breaking this vow to personally bestow upon you the adhikära! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1106
to perform ananya-bhakti . Now, if you give up your nitya  and
naimittika  duties in pursuance of My order, you will not have
to face any reaction. I alone, in the form of the Vedas , have
given the instruction to perform nitya-karma  and now I
Myself am ordering you to give it up. By accepting My order,where is the possibility of you incurring sin as a consequenceof abandoning your nitya-karma ? Rather, if you choose to
ignore My direct order and continue to perform nitya-karma ,
then the result will be that you will incur sin. This you shouldknow to be a fact. If a person surrenders to someone, he re-mains under that persons ownership and control, just likean animal who has been purchased. Whatever the mastercommands him do, he must do; wherever he keeps him, hestays; whatever food he gives him, he eats. This is the essenceof dharma  as understood by one who is fully surrendered,
çaraëägata . The Väyu-Puräëa  lists the six aspects of
çaraëägati :
änukülyasya saìkalpaù prätikülyasya varjanam
rakñiñyatéti viçväso goptåtve varaëaà tathä
ätmä-nikñepa-kärpaëye ñaò-vidhä çaraëägatiù
1) To accept with determination everything that is favourable
for bhakti , 2) to give up everything that is unfavourable for bhakti ,
3) to have the staunch faith that Bhagavän will protect me, 4)to accept Him as ones maintainer 5) to offer oneself completelyand 6) humility.
 To remain devotedly engaged for the pleasure of ones
worshipable Deity, as established in the bhakti-çästras ,  is
änukülya , favourable, and any acts contrary to this are
prätikülya , unfavourable. Varaëa , choosing Him as ones
maintainer, means to feel, He alone is my protector; I havenone other than Him. Rakñiñyati  refers to the faith seen in
those such as Gajendra and Draupadé: Whenever I amÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1107 66
threatened by some unfavourable situation, He will surely
protect me. Nikñepaëa  means to devote ones gross and subtle
body as well as ones own self for the purpose of serving ÇréKåñëa. kärpaëya  means to exclusively express ones humility
and submission to Çré Krñëa alone. When these six activitiesare performed with the intention of attaining prema  for
Bhagavän, it is called çaraëägati .
If I surrender unto You alone, beginning from today, my
only duty is to remain surrendered, whether I attain auspi-ciousness as described by You, or inauspiciousness. In this way,if You engage me in dharmika  activity, there is obviously no
cause for anxiety. But what will my destination be if You,the supremely independent Éçvara, engage me in an adharmika
act? In response to Arjunas doubt, Çré Bhagavän says, I willliberate you from all your accumulated sins, past and present,as well as from any sins I may cause you to perform. Unlikeother masters, I am capable of liberating you from sin. Hav-
ing made you My instrument, I am giving this instruction
from çästra  to you for the benefit of every human being.
Mä çucaù  means, Do not grieve for yourself or others. I
am bound by My vow to carry the burden of freeing anyperson like you from all his sins and deliver him from thecycle of birth and death. If such a person fixes his mind uponMe, completely giving up all his sva-dharma  or para-dharma
and remains happily situated having surrendered to Me, I amalso bound to carry the burden of providing him with themeans to achieve Me. What more can I say? I am even readyto accept the burden of maintaining his material life, as Istated when I spoke ananyäç  cintayanto  mäm  (Gétä  9.22).
Do not grieve by thinking, Alas! I have placed such a
heavy burden on my Lord and master! There is absolutelyno labour involved in accepting this burden for Me, who ambhakta-vatsala  and satya-saìkalpa , whose vows always hold! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1108
true. Having given this instruction, there is no need to give
any further instruction. I therefore conclude this çästra  here.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
Çré Kåñëa gave the most confidential instruction of
Bhagavad-Gétä  concerning çuddha-bhakti  in the previous
çloka.  Now, in this present çloka ,  He states that it is first
necessary to exclusively surrender to Him to become quali-fied to receive this çuddha-bhakti . Here the word sarva-
dharmän  means that varëäçrama-dharma  and its limbs
karma , jïäna , yoga , worship of other devas  and religious
faiths other than kåñëa-bhajana  are all based on the bodily
or mental platform. It is not correct to think that the wordparityajya  only means giving up the attachment to karma
and the fruits of karma . The innermost intention of
Bhagaväns statement is to completely give up karma-niñtùä
(adherence to karma ). This is the deeper meaning of the
prefix pari. Someone may think that there is a possibility
of incurring sin or reaction by giving up all other dharma
as described above, to exclusively surrender to Kåñëa. Toremove this doubt from the minds of common faithful per-sons, Çré Kåñëa has bestowed fearlessness upon them throughHis declaration: sarva-päpebhyo  mokñayiñyämi  mä çucaù .
Do not grieve, I will certainly free you from all types ofsins.
eta saba chäòi ära varëäçrama-dharma
akiïcana haéya laya kåñëaika-çaraëa
Caitanya-caritämåta , Madhya-lélä  22.93
One should give up the bad association of impersonalists who
are bereft of bhakti , as well as karmés , yogés , materialists,
womanisers and those who associate with such womanisers. Oneshould even give up varëäçrama-dharma  and take full shelter of
Kåñëa, becoming humble, meek and possessionless.ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1109
 One cannot embrace the bhävas  described in the previous
çloka  without doing this . However, as long as one falsely
identifies the body as his true self, he fears incurring sin as aresult of giving up dharma . Therefore, Çré Bhagavän has to
take the vow that He will free one from all sins incurred asa result of giving up all types of dharma.  Even after taking
this vow, He is again lifting His hand to bestow fearlessnessand telling Arjuna, Do not grieve. In this way, He reassureshim.
In the Räya Rämänanda-Saàväda , Çré Caitanya
Mahäprabhu has said that even the stage of sarva-dharmän
parityajya  is external. This is because it has no relationship
with ätma-rati , the constitutional loving function ( bhäva ) of
the self. It is merely the initial qualification required to un-derstand the bhäva  of the previous çloka (18.65). Unless a
person fully realises the purport of the present çloka  and
practises it in his life by becoming firmly fixed in the spirit
of it, it will be as impossible for him to understand the deeper
meaning of the previous çloka  as it is to catch an imaginary
flower in the sky. The pure ego, I am a servant of Kåñëa, isnatural in çuddha-bhaktas  and, therefore, varëäçrama-
dharma  is renounced of its own accord. At that time, no sin
or irregularity affects them because they are completely re-nounced. Such bhaktas  are uttama-adhikärés  and qualified for
the highest type of bhakti.
äjïäyaivaà guëän doñän / mayä diñöän api svakän
dharmän santyajya yaù sarvän / mäà bhajeta sa ca sattamaù
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.11.32
Those who render service unto Me, having abandoned all types
of dharma , and having understood the inherent positive and
negative aspects of the prescribed duties instructed by Me inthe Vedas , are counted among the best of sädhus .66! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1110
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura quotes Kåñëa as saying, I
have instructed you in the various types of religions suchas varëäçrama-dharma , yati-dharma  (the renounced order
of life), vairägya  (detachment), sense and mind control,
dhyäna-yoga  and the controlling opulences of Éçvara, so you
can attain brahma-jïäna  and éçvara-jïäna . Now, in His
conclusion, Çré Bhagavän is telling Arjuna to completelygive up all these dharmika  processes and exclusively surren-
der to Him. Only if you surrender in this way will I deliveryou from all types of sins, whether they are caused by yourmaterial conditioning or by renouncing these dharmika
processes. You should consider that you are not the per-former of these activities, and you should not grieve foranything. The true constitutional nature of the jévas is easily
awakened from its dormant state by the performance ofnirguëa-bhakti  to Me. At that time, it is not required that
one perform dharma , prescribed duties or atonements, etc.,
or to practise jïäna , yoga , dhyäna  or any other process. One
should perform bodily, mental and spiritual activities, evenin the bound stage, but he should give up brahma-niñöhä
(adherence to the impersonal feature), being attracted bythe beauty and sweetness of Bhagavän in an exclusivelysurrendered mood. The meaning is that whatever karma  an
embodied jéva performs for his livelihood should be performed
with these types of higher niñöhä : brahma-niñöhä , éçvara-
niñöhä , and bhagavad-niñöhä . Lower niñöhä  refers to akarma
and vikarma ,  which create anarthas . All processes, such as
varëäçrama  and vairägya ,  assume their respective natures
(bhävas ) by adopting one of these types of niñöhä . When
action is performed in subordination to brahma-niñöhä , the
bhäva  of karma  and jïäna  manifests. When action is per-
formed under éçvara-niñöhä ,  the bhäva of karma  offered to
Éçvara ( dhyäna-yoga , etc.,) manifests. And when it is performedÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1111
with bhagavad-niñöhä ,  it transforms into çuddhä  or kevala -
bhakti . Hence, this bhakti  alone is the most confidential
tattva  and prema  is the supreme aim of life. This is, indeed,
the principal teaching and innermost intention ofBhagavad-Gétä . The lifestyles of karmés , jïänés , yogés  and
bhaktas  appear to be the same, but when we observe their
respective types of niñöhä ,  it is clear that there is a vast
difference between their styles of worship in terms of theirsädhana  practice, as well as their ultimate goal.

Thus, having completed His instructions on Gétä-çästra , Çré
Bhagavän is explaining the principle of continuing thesampradäya.  In other words, He is giving the criteria by which
one can ascertain who is qualified to receive these instruc-tions. One whose senses are not under control is called67! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1112
atapaska.  Småti  also states: Tranquility, or control of the
mind and the senses, is the highest penance. These instruc-tions of the Gétä  should not be imparted to a non-devotee,
even if he has control over his senses. Nor should they begiven to a bhakta who is self-controlled but who is not in-
terested in submissive hearing ( açuçrüñu ). A further prohi-
bition is given for a person who fulfils the above three quali-fications (self-controlled, a bhakta ,  and interested in hear-

such a person, at any cost.
S
ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In the present çloka ,  Çré Kåñëa is establishing the neces-
sary qualifications to hear the instructions of the Gétä . The
tattvas  of the Gétä  should never be instructed to those who
are envious of Çré Kåñëa, who consider His transcendentalform to be illusory, who are devoid of bhakti  to the guru  and
the Vaiñëavas, who have no control over their senses, andwho do not render any service to Çré Hari, guru  or the
Vaiñëavas. None of them are qualified to receive the Gétäs
instructions. Because some people are unable to fully realisethe essence of Kåñëas instruction, they narrate the Gétä  in
an unauthorised manner to unqualified persons. They thinkthat this is a symptom of their magnanimous and compas-sionate nature. However, by performing such activities indisobedience to Kåñëas orders, they become offenders. ÇréKåñëa Himself knows most clearly the harmful effects of
giving this knowledge to an unqualified person. Ignorant
persons cannot understand nor retain this jïäna . Some peopleÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1113
may say that it shows a lack of compassion to con sider a
recipients qualification or disqualification in the matter ofgiving him dharmika  instructions. However, this is not correct
because the good results of having received dharmika  instruc-
tions are observed only in a qualified person. An unqualifiedperson however, disobeys such instructions after receiving themand, becoming an offender, falls down even further.
Once, the king of the devas , Indra, and the chief of the
asuras , Virocana, went to Lord Brahmä to receive instruc-
tion on ätma-tattva . Brahmä instructed Indra who was a
qualified recipient of this knowledge, and who was able tocomprehend tattva-jïäna . However, Virocana, who was un-
qualified, was not able to follow the instructions given byBrahmä. He understood the self to be his gross body only,and the maintenance of it to be the goal of life. In this way,Virocana remained bereft of true tattva-jïäna . Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  (6.23) also states:
yasya deve parä bhaktir / yathä deve tathä gurau
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäh / prakäçante mahätmänaù
The conclusive essence of the çrutis  is only revealed to those
great souls who have parä bhakti  unto Çré Bhagavän and who have
an equal amount of bhakti  for Çré Gurudeva.
 In Çrémad-Bhägavatam ,  Çré Kåñëa instructs Uddhava in
a similar way:
naitat tvayä dämbhikäya / nästikäya çaöhäya ca
açuçrüñor abhaktäya / durvinétäya déyatäm
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.29.30
You must never give this jïäna  to persons who are proud, athe-
istic, wicked, faithless, devoid of bhakti  or unsubmissive.

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ
Çré Bhagavän is describing the results attained by those who
give instruction on this Gétä-çästra ,  in two çlokas , the first
starting with the word yaù. They first attain My parä bhakti
and later they attain Me.
SÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
In this çloka ,  Çré Bhagavän is describing the symptoms and
destiny of the genuine qualified preachers and the genuinequalified hearers or students of the Gétä. While giving Arjuna
the most secret instruction of the Gétä (18.65), Çré Kåñëa said,
You are very dear to Me. That is why I am explaining thishighly confidential truth to you. In the previous çloka ,ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1115
Kåñëa also instructed that one should give this knowledge of
the Gétä  only to a person who is self-controlled, faithful, en-
dowed with a service attitude and who has love for Him.Therefore, it is essential for the preacher of Gétä-çästra  to
have strong çraddhä  in Kåñëa and aikäntika-bhakti for Him.
He must be fully conversant with tattva-jïäna  and free from
any doubts. If a preacher of the Gétä  has theoretical knowl-
edge, but does not practise it, or if he is bereft of the above-mentioned qualities, then he is not a bona fide preacher andone must never hear the instructions of the Gétä  from him.
The result will simply be that both the listener and thepreacher will remain deprived of the Gétäs  true jïäna .
Çästra describes the qualifications and the characteristics
of a sincere listener. Çré Kåñëa says to Uddhava:
etair doñair vihénäya / brahmaëyäya priyäya ca
sädhave çucaye brüyäd / bhaktiù syäc chüdra-yoñitäm
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  11.29.31
One should give these teachings to those who are free from the
defects of conceit, atheism, wickedness, faithlessness, arrogance,or who are devoid of bhakti. They should be dedicated to the
welfare of the brähmaëas , strive for bhagavat-prema , have a saintly
nature and, above all, they should be bhaktas . But these instruc-
tions can be given to a çüdra  or a woman who has çraddhä  in Me
and possesses bhakti  to Me .
From this it is clear that ones caste, creed, age, activities,
etc,. are not to be considered in the matter of  deciding whois fit to receive the tattva  of the Gétä . Anyone who has the
above-mentioned qualities is qualified to hear it. In Çré
Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya-lélä 22.64), this principle has
been substantiated: çraddhävän  jana haya  bhakti  adhikäré.  A
faithful bhakta is a truly eligible candidate to perform ser-
vice to the Lord. Çré Kapiladeva has also said:68! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1116

Only narrate this to faithful, devout bhaktas  who are submis-
sive, free from malice, well-wishing to all living entities, engagedin sevä, renounced from external sense pleasures, peaceful, free
from envy, and for whom I am the only beloved.
The essence of this instruction is that any person who has
çraddhä  and bhakti  for Kåñëa is qualified to hear the Gétä-
çästra . Those who impart the instructions of the Gétä to such
qualified persons attain parä bhakti  and finally attain Kåñëa,
without a doubt. Similarly, the qualified listeners also attainthe same supreme destination.

do not preach the confidential, more confidential and mostconfidential tattva  of the Gétä.  Instead, they teach mäyävädä ,

After concluding the instructions on the Gétä and describ-

with fixed attention. Another point is that, even after hear-ing the confidential tattva  of Gétä from Çré Gurudeva or tattva-
darçé  bhaktas , until the student fully realises such tattva ,  he
should continue to repeatedly hear it through the process ofsubmissive inquiry and by rendering service. He will not beable to understand these teachings otherwise.71-72! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1120

Çré Kåñëa-Dvaipäyana Vyäsadeva was the guru  of Saïjaya.
Saïjaya acknowledges that he heard and understood thedivya-jïäna  of Çrémad  Bhagavad-gétä ,  which manifested from
the dialogue between Kåñëa and Arjuna, only by the graceof his guru , Çréla Vyäsadeva. Without the grace of guru , the
tattva  of Gétä  (bhagavat-tattva ) cannot be understood. The
guru  must be as well versed in tattva  as Çréla Vyäsadeva was,
and endowed with realisation of Bhagavän. The discipleshould be like Saïjaya, capable of rendering attentive ser-vice to the guru , as well as desiring to hear from him and to
follow his teachings and instructions without argument. Onlysuch a faithful disciple can achieve perfection after under-standing bhagavat-tattva . It should also be understood that,
just as Arjuna became supremely blessed after hearing thedeep secret of the Bhagavad -gétä directly from the lotus mouth
of Svayaà Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa, Saïjaya also, by the graceof Çréla Vyäsadeva, became supremely blessed after hearingand understanding it, although he was sitting far away fromKurukñetra. And just as Arjuna and Saïjaya were blessed andbecame perfect, any person who wants to make his life per-fect can do so by taking shelter of a bona fide guru-
paramparä ,  and surrendering to a self-realised guru  or a
Vaiñëava. It is impossible to attain bhagavat-tattva unless one
accepts a çuddha-bhakti-paramparä.

From this çloka ,  it appears that the viçvarüpa  of Çré Kåñëa
which Arjuna saw at Kurukñetra was also seen by Saïjaya, bythe grace of Çréla Vyäsadeva, as he sat in the royal palace inHastinäpura. This took place by the grace of ÇrélaÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1125
Vyäsadeva. Çré Kåñëa had explained to Arjuna that He had
not shown that form to anyone before, and that He wasshowing it to Arjuna for the first time. However, by thor-oughly deliberating upon this point, it can be understoodthat both Saïjaya and Vyäsa most definitely saw theviçvarüpa  along with Arjuna. And from Arjunas statement,
it can be understood that even åñis, maharñis  and devatäs
also saw it. Çré Vedavyäsa is Çré Kåñëas parama-bhakta . Not
only that, he is also a çaktyäveça-avatära  of Bhagavän Him-

ÄRÄRTHA -VARÑIËÉ  PRAKÄÇIKÄ -VÅTTI
The Eighteenth Chapter briefly describes the essence of the
entire Gétä. One division describes karma-yoga  predominated77-78! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1126
by dhyäna-yoga , which results in ätma-jïäna.  The other divi-
sion describes çuddha-bhakti-yoga  that originates from çraddhä
related to Bhagavän. This is indeed the essence of the Gétä.
Within these two divisions, the confidential instruction is togradually achieve the path of jïäna  by performing niñkäma-
karma , while adopting varëäçrama-dharma  based on ones own
nature. The more confidential instruction is to cultivate ätma-
jïäna  within this life, through dhyäna-yoga.  And the most
confidential instruction is to engage in bhakti-yoga  by exclu-
sively surrendering unto Svayaà Bhagavän Çré Kåñëa. This isthe essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.
The purport of the entire Bhagavad-gétä  is that advaya-vastu ,
the non-dual Absolute Entity, is the only tattva . Çré Bhagavän
is the complete manifestation of that tattva . All other tattvas
have emanated from Him. From His cit-çakti , bhagavat-svarüpa
and cid-vaibhava ,  the spiritual opulences emanate. Two types
of infinite jévas manifest from his jéva-çakti : the liberated
(mukta ) and the bound ( baddha ). And the twenty-four ele-
ments, from pradhäna  to the blade of grass, manifest from His
mäyä-çakti . Creation, maintenance and annihilation of dif-
ferent states comes from the käla-çakti , time potency. All types
of manifestations emanate from the kriyä-çakti .
The five elementsÉçvara, prakåti , jéva, käla and karma
have manifested from bhagavat-tattva  only. Brahma ,
Paramätmä, etc., are all within Bhagavän, as are all otherconceptions of the Absolute Truth. Although the five ele-ments listed above are separate,  they are simultaneously one
element under the control of bhagavat-tattva ,  and although
they are one, they are eternally different because they havedifferent characteristics. This explanation of bhed-äbheda-
tattva , or simultaneous oneness and difference, given in the
Gétä  is beyond human logic. Therefore, the previous
mahäjanas  have called this tattva ,  acintya-bhed-äbheda-
tattva , and the jïäna  related to it, tattva-jïäna .ÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1127
Jéva:  The jévas are pure conscious entities by constitutional
nature, and they are a special tattva  which exist as atomic
particles in the rays emanating from cit-sürya , the transcen-
dental conscious sun, Kåñëa. By nature, they are qualified toexist in the spiritual and in the material worlds. They aresituated on the border of the cit (spiritual) and the acit (ma-
terial) world. Because they are conscious, they are indepen-dent by nature. If they are favourable to Kåñëa and attractedto the spiritual world, then they can relish pure änanda  with
the help of the hlädiné-çakti , Kåñëas pleasure potency. On
the other hand, if they turn away from Kåñëa, being attractedto the illusory world, due to the influence of the mäyä-çakti ,
then they have to undergo material happiness and distress.The jévas who have cid-rati , affinity for the conscious world,
are nitya-mukta , eternally liberated, and those who have jaòa-
rati, affinity towards the world of unconscious matter, are nitya-
baddha.  Both types of jévas are unlimited in number.
Forgetting his pure constitutional nature, the jéva suffers
various types of miseries in the ocean of material existencein higher and lower forms of life, such as devas , humans,
worms, trees and creepers. Sometimes he becomes dejected
and disgusted. He then takes shelter of a proper guru  and
attains perfection in dhyäna  through karma-yoga.  Thus
realising his pure svarüpa ,  he attains prema  for the lotus feet
of Çré Bhagavän. Or, if he develops çraddhä  in topics of
Bhagavän, he takes shelter of a proper guru  and performs
sädhana-bhakti.  He then attains bhäva-bhakti  and finally
prema-bhakti.  There are no paths other than these two for
the ätmä to realise his pure svarüpa .
Of the two paths of ätma-jïäna  mentioned above, the path
of karma-yoga  predominated by dhyäna-yoga  is suitable for
the common man, because it is under the control of ones ownefforts. Bhakti-yoga , which arises from çraddhä , is superior78! ÇRÉMAD  BHAGAVAD -GÉTÄ                    C HAPTER  18 1128
to karma-yoga  and also easier to perform, but it cannot be
attained without receiving the good fortune of the grace ofBhagavän or His bhaktas . Therefore, most people in the world
are inclined to perform karma-yoga . Among such karma-
yogés , those who are fortunate develop çraddhä  in bhakti-yoga ,
and thus they attain the stage of exclusive surrender toBhagavän as described in the concluding çloka  of the Gétä.
This is the abhidheya  (process) described in all the Vedas .
The path of karma  is based on material desires. Its goals:
attainment of material happiness, enjoyment in the four-teen planetary systems, and mukti are all devoid of true
value for the conscious jéva. The very beginning of the Gétä
describes fruitive karma  and its result, bhukti (sense enjoy-
ment), as being worthless. Even the attainment of säyujya-
nirväëa , which is the perfection of monism, and is attained
when one has become liberated from birth and death, is notthe ultimate purpose of the jéva. This has also been stated
in various places. The supreme prayojana  of the jéva is to
rise above impersonal realisation and the four types ofmukti , such as sälokya , and achieve nirmala-prema  to Çré
Kåñëa by entering into the topmost spiritual realm where
His léläs are performed.
Having compiled the siddhänta  of all the Vedas  and
Vedänta  in the Gétä, it has been determined that the supreme
goal is to attain prema  for Bhagavän by performing bhakti-
yoga with knowledge of ones relationship with Him. A per-
son should always practise bhakti-yoga  by hearing, chant-
ing, etc. as well as by following his dharma  according to his
qualifications. He should maintain his life by perform ing his
occupation while remaining favourable to the cultivation ofbhakti-yoga.  With great çraddhä  in the higher process, he
should gradually give up his niñöhä  in the lower process. Then
he should become firmly fixed in bhakti-yoga , throughÇLOKA MOKÑA -YOGA !1129
çaraëägati , full surrender, and thus live his life in this way.
Then Bhagavän will quickly award him çuddha-prema .
Merely by entering into the process of purifying his exist-ence, a person achieves the mercy of Bhagavän. This mercymakes him fearless, immortal and free from lamentation, andhe becomes eternally absorbed in His prema .
Thus ends the Särärtha-Varñiëé Prakäçikä-våtti ,
by Çré Çrémad Bhaktivedänta Näräyaëa Mahäräja ,
