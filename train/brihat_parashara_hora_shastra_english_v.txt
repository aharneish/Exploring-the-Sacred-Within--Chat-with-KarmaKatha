Ch. 1. The Creation 
I prostrate before the lotus-feet of Lord Vighneswara, offspring of Uma, the 
cause of destruction of sorrow, who is served by Mahābhutas (the five 
great elements of the universe) etc., who has the face of a tusker and who 
consumes the essence of Kapittha and Jambu fruits. 1-4. Offering his obeisance to all-knowing Mahārishi Parāśar and with 
folded hands, Maitreya said: “O venerable Mahārishi, Jyotish, the supreme 
limb of the Vedas, has three divisions, viz. Horā, Ganita and Samhita. 
Among the said three divisions Horā, or the general part of Jyotish is still 
more excellent. I desire to know of its glorious aspects from you. Be 
pleased to tell me, how this Universe is created? How does it end? What is 
the relationship of the animals, born on this earth, with the heavenly 
bodies? Please speak elaborately” 
5-8. Mahārishi Parāśar answered. O Brahmin, your query has an 
auspicious purpose in it for the welfare of the Universe. Praying Lord 
Brahma and Śrī Sarasvatī, his power (and consort) and Sūrya, the leader 
of the Grahas and the cause of Creation, I shall proceed to narrate to you 
the science of Jyotish, as heard through Lord Brahma. Only good will follow 
the teaching of this Vedic Science to the students, who are peacefully 
disposed, who honour the preceptors (and elders), who speak only truth 
and are godfearing. Woeful forever, doubtlessly, will it be to impart 
knowledge of this science to an unwilling student, to a heterodox and to a 
crafty person. 
9-12. Śrī Vishnu, who is the Lord (of all matters), who has undefiled spirit, 
who is endowed with the three Gunas, although he transcends the grip of 
Gunas (Gunatita), who is the Author of this Universe, who is glorious, who 
is the Cause and who is endowed with valour, has no beginning. He 
authored the Universe and administers it with a quarter of his power. The 
other three quarters of Him, filled with nectar, are knowable only to the 
philosophers (of maturity). The Principal Evolver, who is both perceptible 
and imperceptible in Vasudeva. The Imperceptible part of the Lord is 
endowed with dual powers, while the Perceptible with triple powers. 
13-15. The three powers are Śrī Shakti (Mother Lakshmi) with Sattva-Gun, 
Bhū Shakti (Mother-Earth) with Rajo-Gun and Nīl Shakti with Tamo-Gun. 
Apart from the three, the fourth kind of Vishnu, influenced by Śrī Shakti and 
Bhoo Shakti, assumes the form of Shankarshan with Tamo-Gun, of 
Pradyumna with Rajo-Gun and of Anirudh with Sattva-Gun. 
16-17. Mahatatwa, Ahamkar and Ahamkar Murti and Brahma, are born 
from Shankarshan, Pradyumna and Anirudh, respectively. All these three 
forms are endowed with all the three Gunas, with predominance of the Gun 
due to their origin. 18-19. Ahamkar is of three classes, i.e. with Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic 
dispositions. Divine class, sensory organs and the five primordial 
compounds (space, air, fire, water and earth) are, respectively, from the 
said three Ahamkaras. 
20. Lord Vishnu, coupled with Śrī Shakti, rules over the three worlds. 
Coupled with Bhoo Shakti, He is Brahma causing the Universe. Coupled 
with Neel Shakti, He is Shiva, destroying the Universe. 
21-24. The Lord is in all beings and the entire Universe is in Him. All beings 
contain both Jivatma and Paramatmāńśas. Some have predominance of 
the former, while yet some have the latter in predominance. Paramatmāńś 
is predominant in the Grahas, viz. Sūrya etc. and Brahma, Shiva and 
others. Their powers, or consorts too have predominance of Paramatmāńś. 
Others have more of Jivatmāńś. 
Ch. 2. Great Incarnations 
1. Maitreya: “O Mahārishi Parāśar, are the incarnations of Vishnu, viz. Śrī 
Ram, Śrī Krishn etc., endowed with Jivāńś? 
2. Maharishi Parashar: “O Brahmin, the four incarnations, viz. Ram, Krishn, 
Narasimh and Varah are wholly with Paramatmāńś. The other incarnations 
(than these, out of the ten) have in them Jivāńś too. 
3-4. The unborn Lord has many incarnations. He has incarnated, as the 9 
(Nava) Grahas to bestow on the living beings the results due to their 
Karmas. He is Janardan. He assumed the auspicious form of Grahas to 
destroy the demons (evil forces) and sustain the divine beings. 
5-7. From Sūrya the incarnation of Ram, from Candr that of Krishn, from 
Mangal that of Narasimh, from Budh that of Buddha, from Guru that of 
Vaman, from Śukr that of Parashuram, from Śani that of Kurma (Tortoise), 
from Rahu that of Varah (Pig) and from Ketu that of Meen (Fish) occurred. 
All other incarnations than these also are through the Grahas. The beings 
with more Paramatmāńś are called divine beings. 
8-13. The beings with more Jivatmāńś are (mortal) beings. The high degree 
of Paramatmāńś from the Grahas, viz. Sūrya etc. did incarnate, as Ram, 
Krishn etc. After completing the mission, the Paramatmāńśas (of the 
respective) Grahas again merge (in the respective) Grahas. The Jivatma portions from the Grahas take births, as human beings and live their lives 
according to their Karmas and again merge in the Grahas. And at the time 
of Great Destruction the Grahas as well merge in Lord Vishnu. The one, 
who knows of all these, will become versed in the knowledge of the past, 
present and future. Without a knowledge of Jyotish these cannot be known. 
Hence, everyone should have a knowledge of Jyotish, particularly the 
Brahmin. The one, who, devoid of knowledge of Jyotish, blames this Vedic 
Science will go to the hell called „Raurava‟ and will be reborn blind. 
Ch. 3. Grah Characters and Description 
1. Maitreya: “O Mahārishi, you have affectionately explained about the 
incarnations of Grahas. Now kindly detail their characters and dispositions. 
2-3. Paraśar: “O Brahmin, listen to the account of placement of the 
heavenly bodies. Out of the many luminous bodies sighted in the skies 
some are stars, yet some are Grahas. Those, that have no movements, are 
the Nakshatras (asterisms). 
4-6. Those are called „Grahas‟, that move through the Nakshatras (or 
stellar mansions) in the zodiac. The said zodiac comprises of 27 
Nakshatras commencing from Ashvini. The same area is divided in 12 
parts equal to 12 „Rāśis‟ commencing from Mesh. The names of the 
Grahas commence from Sūrya. The Rāśi rising is known, as „Lagn‟. Based 
on Lagn and the Grahas, joining and departing from each other, the 
native‟s good and bad effects are deducted. 
Addition from Santhanam till Sloka 7. The names of the 27 Nakshatras are 
Ashvini, Bharani, Krittika, Rohini, Mrigasira, Ardra, Punarvasu, Pushya, 
Aslesha, Magha, Purvaphalguni, Uttaraphalguni, Hasta, Chitra, Swati, 
Vishaka, Anuradha, Jyeshtha, Mula, Purvashadh, Uttarashadh, Shravana, 
Dhanishtha, Satabhisha, Purvabhadra, Uttarabhadra, Revati. 
Lagn is a very important point in the horoscope. It is the Rāśi, that rises in 
the East, on the latitude of birth. The apparent rising of a Rāśi is due to the 
rotation of the earth on its own axis at a rate of motion, causing every 
degree of the zodiac seemingly ascend on the eastern horizon. Approximately, two hours are required for a Rāśi to pass via the horizon, 
thereby every degree taking four minutes to ascend. This duration, 
however, is actually dependent on the concerned latitude. 
Actually Sūrya has no motion. His motion is an apparent one, as viewed 
from the rotating earth. Other Grahas, including the nodes, have varied 
rates of motion. The average daily motions of the Grahas, which are not, 
however standard, are, as follows: Sūrya 1, Candr 13-15, Mangal 30-45‟, 
Budh 65-100‟, Śukr 62-82‟, Guru 5-15‟, Śani 2‟, Rahu/Ketu 3‟. 
With such different motions, a Grah forms various Drishtis with others. 
These Drishtis through longitudinal distances have a great deal of utility in 
Jyotish. This is what Maharishi Parashar suggests to be considered. 
7. Details (of astronomical nature) of stars have to be understood by 
general rules, while I narrate to you about the effects of Grahas and Rāśis. 
8-9. The positions of the Grahas for a given time be taken, as per Drikganit. 
And with the help of Rāśi durations, applicable to the respective places, 
Lagn at birth should be known. Now, I tell you about the castes, 
descriptions and dispositions of the Grahas. 
10. Names of Grahas. The names of the nine Grahas, respectively, are 
Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr, Śani, Rahu and Ketu. 
11. Benefics and Malefics. Among these, Sūrya, Śani, Mangal, decreasing 
Candr, Rahu and Ketu (the ascending and the descending nodes of Candr) 
are malefics, while the rest are benefics. Budh, however, is a malefic, if he 
joins a malefic. 
Addition from Santhanam till Sloka 12-13. When Candr is ahead of Sūrya, 
but within 120, she has medium strength. Between 120 to 240 she is very 
auspicious,( see „Atishubhapred‟). From 240 to 0 she is bereft of strength. 
This is Yavanas‟ view, vide P. 70 of my English Translation of Saravali. 
This view is, however, related to Candr‟s strength, or otherwise, while 
waning Candr (Krishna Paksh, dark half) is a malefic and waxing Candr 
(Shukla Paksh, bright half) is a benefic. Should Candr be Yuti with a 
benefic, or receiving a Drishti from a benefic, she turns a benefic, even if in 
a waning state. As regards Budh, we have clear instructions from Maharishi 
Parashar, that he becomes a malefic, if he joins a malefic. If waning Candr 
and Budh are together, both are benefics. 12-13. Grah governances. Sūrya is the soul of all. Candr is the mind. 
Mangal is one‟s strength. Budh is speech-giver, while Guru confers 
Knowledge and happiness. Śukr governs semen (potency), while Śani 
denotes grief. 
14-15. Grah cabinet. Of royal status are Sūrya and Candr, while Mangal is 
the Army chief. Prince-apparent is Budh. The ministerial Grahas are Guru 
and Śukr. Śani is a servant. Rahu and Ketu form the Grah Army. 
16-17. Complexions of Grahas. Sūrya is blood-red. Candr is tawny. 
Mangal, who is not very tall is blood-red, while Budh‟s hue is akin to that of 
green grass. Tawny, variegated and dark are Guru, Śukr and Śani in their 
order. 
18. Deities of Grahas. Fire (Agni)  (?), Water (Varuna), Subrahmanya (Lord 
Shiva‟s son, following Ganesh), Maha Vishnu, Indra, Shachi Devi (the 
consort of Lord Indra) and Brahma  (?) are the presiding deities of the 7 
Grahas in their order. 
19. Gender of the Grahas. Budh and Śani are neuters. Candr and Śukr are 
females, while Sūrya, Mangal and Guru are males. 
20. Primordial compounds. The Panchabhutas, space, air, fire, water and 
earth, are, respectively, governed by Guru, Śani, Mangal, Śukr and Budh. 
21. Castes of Grahas. Guru and Śukr are Brahmins. Sūrya is a royal Grah, 
while Candr and Budh belong to commercial community. Śani rules the 
Sudras (4th caste). 
22. Sattvic Grahas are the luminaries and Guru, Śukr and Budh are 
Rajasik, while Mangal and Śani are Tamasic. 
23. Description of Sūrya. Sūrya‟s eyes are honey-coloured. He has a 
square body. He is of clean habits, bilious, intelligent and has limited hair 
(on his head). 
24. Description of Candr. Candr is very windy and phlegmatic. She is 
learned and has a round body. She has auspicious looks and sweet 
speech, is fickle-minded and very lustful. 25. Description of Mangal. Mangal has blood-red eyes, is fickle-minded, 
liberal , bilious, given to anger and has thin waist and thin physique. 
26. Description of Budh. Budh is endowed with an attractive physique and 
the capacity to use words with many meanings. He is fond of jokes. He has 
a mix of all the three humours. 
27. Description of Guru. Guru has a big body, tawny hair and tawny eyes, 
is phlegmatic, intelligent and learned in Shastras. 
28. Description of Śukr. Śukr is charming, has a splendourous physique, is 
excellent, or great in disposition, has charming eyes, is a poet, is 
phlegmatic and windy and has curly hair. 
29. Description of Śani. Śani has an emaciated and long physique, has 
tawny eyes, is windy in temperament, has big teeth, is indolent and lame 
and has coarse hair. 
30. Description of Rahu and Ketu. Rahu has smoky appearance with a blue 
mix physique. He resides in forests and is horrible. He is windy in 
temperament and is intelligent. Ketu is akin to Rahu. 
31. Primary ingredients (or Sapth Dhatus). Bones, blood, marrow, skin, fat, 
semen and muscles are, respectively, denoted by the Grahas: Sūrya, 
Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr and Śani. 
32. Abodes of the Grahas. Temple, watery place, place of fire, sport-
ground, treasure-house, bed-room and filthy ground: these are, 
respectively, the abodes for the seven Grahas from Sūrya onward. 
33. Grah periods. Ayan, Muhurta, a day (consisting day and night), Ritu, 
month, fortnight and year: these are the periods allotted to the Grahas from 
Sūrya to Śani. 
34. Tastes of the Grahas. Pungent, saline, bitter, mixed, sweet, acidulous 
and astringent are, respectively, tastes lorded by Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, 
Budh, Guru, Śukr and Śani. 
35-38. Strengths of Grahas. Strong in the East are Budh and Guru. Sūrya 
and Mangal are so in the South, while Śani is the only Grah, that derives 
strength in the West. Candr and Śukr are endowed with vigour, when in the North. Again, strong during night are Candr, Mangal and Śani, while Budh 
is strong during day and night. The rest (i.e. Guru, Sūrya and Śukr) are 
strong only in daytime. During the dark half malefics are strong. Benefics 
acquire strength in the bright half of the month. Malefics and benefics are, 
respectively, strong in Dakshinayan and Uttarayan. The Lords of the year, 
month, day and Hora (hour of Grah) are stronger than the other in 
ascending order. Again, stronger than the other in the ascending are Śani, 
Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr, Candr and Sūrya. 
39-40. Related to trees. Sūrya rules strong trees (i.e. trees with stout 
trunks), Śani useless trees, Candr milky trees (and rubber yielding plants), 
Mangal bitter ones (like lemon plants), Śukr floral plants, Guru fruitful ones 
and Budh fruitless ones. 
41-44. Other matters. Rahu rules the outcaste, while Ketu governs mixed 
caste. Śani and the nodes indicate ant-hills. Rahu denotes multi-coloured 
clothes and Ketu rags. Lead and blue gem belong to Rahu and Ketu. 
Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr and Śani in their order govern red 
silken, white silken, red, black silken, saffron, silken and multi-coloured 
robes. 
45-46. Seasons of Grahas. Vasanta, Greeshma, Varsh, Sarad, Hemanta 
and Sisir are the six Ritus (or seasons), respectively, governed by Śukr, 
Mangal, Candr, Budh, Guru and Śani. Rahu and Ketu denote 8 months and 
3 months, respectively. 
47. Dhatu, Mool and Jiva Divisions. Dhatu Grahas are Rahu, Mangal, Śani 
and Candr, while Sūrya and Śukr are Mula Grahas. Budh, Guru and Ketu 
rule Jivas. 
48. Age. Out of all the Grahas Śani is the eldest. He bestows maximum 
number of years in Naisargik Dasha. 
49-50. Exaltation and Debilitation. For the seven Grahas, from Sūrya on, 
the exaltation Rāśis are, respectively, Mesh, Vrishabh, Makar, Kanya, Kark, 
Meen and Tula. The deepest exaltation degrees are, respectively, 10, 3, 
28, 15, 5, 27 and 20 in those Rāśis. And in the seventh Rāśi from the said 
exaltation Rāśi each Grah has its own debilitation. The same degrees of 
deep exaltation apply to deep fall. 51-54. Additional Dignities. In Simh the first 20 degrees are Sūrya‟s 
Mooltrikon, while the rest is his own Bhava. After the first 3 degrees of 
exaltation portion in Vrishabh, for Candr, the rest is her Mooltrikon. Mangal 
has the first 12 degrees in Mesh, as Mooltrikon with the rest therein 
becoming simply his own Bhava. For Budh, in Kanya the first 15 degrees 
are exaltation zone, the next 5 degrees Mooltrikon and the last 10 degrees 
are own Bhava. The first one third of Dhanu is the Mooltrikon of Guru, while 
the remaining part thereof is his own Bhava. Śukr divides Tula into two 
halves keeping the first, as Mooltrikon and the second, as own Bhava. 
Śani‟s arrangements are same in Kumbh, as Sūrya has in Simh. 
55. Natural Relationships. Note the Rāśis, which are the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th 
and 12th from the Mooltrikon of a Grah. The Grahas ruling such Rāśis are 
its friends, apart from the Lord of its exaltation Rāśi. Lords other than these 
are its enemies. If a Grah becomes its friend as well, as its enemy (on 
account of the said two computations), then it is neutral, or equal. 
56. Temporary Relationships. The Grah, posited in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 
11th, or the 12th from another, becomes a mutual friend. There is enmity 
otherwise. (This applies to a given Janm Kundali) 
57-58. Compound Relationship. Should two Grahas be naturally and 
temporarily friendly, they become extremely friendly. Friendship on one 
count and neutrality on another count make them friendly. Enmity on one 
count combined with affinity on the other turns into equality. Enmity and 
neutralship cause only enmity. Should there be enmity in both manners, 
extreme enmity is obtained. The Jyotishi should consider these and declare 
horoscopic effects accordingly. 
59-60. Ratio of Effects. A Grah in exaltation gives fully good effects, while 
in Mooltrikon it is bereft of its auspicious effects by one fourth. It is half 
beneficial in its own Bhava. Its beneficence is one fourth in a friendly Rāśi. 
In an equal‟s Rāśi one eighth of auspicious disposition is useful. The good 
effects are nil in debilitation, or enemy‟s camp. Inauspicious effects are 
quite reverse with reference to what is stated. 
61-64. Non-luminous UpaGrahas (Sub-Grahas). Add 4 Rāśis 13 degrees 
and 20 minutes of arc to Sūrya‟s longitude at a given moment to get the 
exact position of the all inauspicious Dhoom. Reduce Dhoom from 12 Rāśis 
to arrive at Vyatipat. Vyatipat is also inauspicious. Add six Rāśis to Vyatipat to know the position of Parivesh. He is extremely inauspicious. Deduct 
Parivesh from 12 Rāśis to arrive at the position of Chap (Indra Dhanus), 
who is also inauspicious. Add 16 degrees 40 minutes to Chap, which will 
give Ketu (UpaKetu), who is a malefic. By adding a Rāśi to UpaKetu, you 
get the original longitude of Sūrya. These are the Grahas, devoid of 
splendour, which are malefics by nature and cause affliction. 
65. Effects of Sub-Grahas. If one of these afflicts Sūrya, the native‟s 
dynasty will decline, while Candr and Lagn, respectively, associated with 
one of these, will destroy the longevity and wisdom. So declared Lord 
Brahma, the Lotus- Born.  
66-69. Calculations of Gulik etc. The portions of Sūrya etc. up to Śani 
denote the periods of Gulik and others. Divide the day duration (of any 
week day) into eight equal parts. The eighth portion is Lord-less. The seven 
portions are distributed to the seven Grahas commencing from the Lord of 
the week day. Whichever portion is ruled by Śani, will be the portion of 
Gulik. Similarly make the night duration into eight equal parts and distribute 
these, commencing from the Lord of the 5th (by) week. Here again, the 
eighth portion is Lord-less, while Śani‟s portion is Gulik. Sūrya‟s portion is 
Kaal, Mangal‟s portion is Mrityu, Guru‟s portion is Yamaghantak and 
Budh‟s portion is Ardhaprahar. These durations differently apply to different 
places (commensurate with variable day and night durations). 
70. Gulik‟s Position. The degree, ascending at the time of start of Gulik‟s 
portion (as above), will be the longitude of Gulik at a given place. Based on 
this longitude only, Gulik‟s effects for a particular nativity be estimated. 
71-74. Calculation of Pranapad. Convert the given time into Vighatis and 
divide the same by 15. The resultant Rāśi, degrees etc. be added to Sūrya, 
if he is in a Movable Rāśi, which will yield Pranapad. If Sūrya is in a Fixed 
Rāśi, add 240 degrees additionally and, if in a Dual Rāśi, add 120 degrees 
in furtherance to get Pranapad. The birth will be auspicious, if Pranapad 
falls in the 2nd, 5th, 9th, 4th, 10th, or 11th from the natal Lagn. In other Bhavas 
Pranapad indicates an inauspicious birth.  
Notes. Ardhaprahar, Yamaghantak, Mrityu, Kaal and Gulik are the 5 Kaal 
Velas, suggested by Maharishi Parashar. The day duration, according to 
altitude, is divided into eight equal parts. The eighth portion is unlorded. 
The first portion is allotted to the weekday Lord. Other portions follow in the order of weekday Lords. We consider 5 portions of Grahas, ignoring that of 
Candr and Śukr. The portions of Sūrya, Mangal, Budh, Guru and Śani are, 
respectively, called Kaal, Mrityu, Ardhaprahar, Yamaghantak and Gulik. 
In the case of night the durations, or 1/8th parts are allotted in a different 
order. The first portion goes to the Grah, ruling the 5th weekday Lord, 
counted from the day in question. The others follow in the usual order. Here 
again, the 8th part is Lord-less. The portions of Grahas from Kaal to Gulik 
are the same in nomenclature in the night also. 
Keeranuru NataRaja of Jatakalankaram (Tamil version) gives Rāśis of 
dignities for these UpaGrahas and Gulik etc. (UpaGrah & Gulik etc.: 
Exaltation, Debilitation, Swakshetra (own Rāśi)) Dhoom: Simh, Kumbh, 
Makar; Vyatipat: Vrischik, Vrishabh, Mithun; Parivesh: Mithun, Dhanu, 
Dhanu; Indrachap: Dhanu, Mithun, Kark; UpaKetu: Kumbh, Simh, Kark; 
Gulik: - , -, Kumbh; Yamaghantak: - , -, Dhanu; Ardhaprahar: - , -, Mithun; 
Kaal: -, -, Makar; Mrityu: -, -, Vrischik. 
From Sūrya to Śani no one is exalted in the above-mentioned exaltation 
Rāśis, nor debilitated in the above-mentioned debilitation Rāśis. 
Out of the 5 Kaal Velas, viz. Gulik etc., four except Kaal (related to Sūrya) 
have their own Rāśi system in the respective Rāśis, ruled by their fathers. 
Gulik, son of Śani, has Kumbh, as his own Bhava. Guru‟s son, 
Yamaghantak, has it in Dhanu. Ardhaprahar, Budh‟s son, is in own Rāśi, if 
in Mithun. Mrityu, son of Mangal, has Vrischik, as own Bhava. It is not 
known, why Kaal, a son of Sūrya shifted to Makar, a Rāśi of his brother 
(Śani), leaving his father‟s Simh. Obviously, Śani has given his Mooltrikon 
to his son Gulik, while he gave Makar (a secondary Rāśi) to his „brother‟ 
Kaal.  
Ch. 4. Zodiacal Rāśis Described 
1-2. Importance of Hora. The word Hora is derived from Ahoratr after 
dropping the first and last syllables. Thus Hora (Lagnas) remains in 
between Ahoratr (i.e. day and night) and after knowing Hora the good and 
bad effects of a native be known. Śrī Vishnu, the Invisible is Time 
personified. His limbs are the 12 Rāśis, commencing from Mesh. 3. Names of Rāśis. The 12 Rāśis of the zodiac in order are Mesh,

each of 30 degrees extent, are described to evaluate gross and specific 
effects. 
25-30. Nishek Lagn. O excellent of Brahmins, now is a step explained to 
arrive at the Nishek Lagn, when the natal Lagn is known. Note the angular 
distance between Śani and Mandi (Gulik). Add this to the difference 
between the Lagn Bhava (Madhya, or cusp) and the 9th Bhava (cusp). The 
resultant product in Rāśis, degrees etc. will represent the months, days 
etc., that elapsed between Nishek and birth. At birth, if Lagn Lord is in the 
invisible half (i.e. from Lagn cusp to descendental cusp), add the degrees 
etc., Candr moved in the particular Rāśi, occupied by her, to the above-
mentioned product. Then Lagn at Nishek can be worked out and the good 
and bad, experienced by the native in the womb, can be guessed. One can 
also guess with the help of Nishek Lagn effects, like longevity, death etc. of 
the parents. 
Ch. 5. Special Lagnas 
1. Oh excellent of the Brahmins, I explain below again some special 
Lagnas, viz. Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn and Ghati Lagn. 
2-3. Bhava Lagn. From sunrise to the time of birth every 5 Ghatis (or 120 
minutes) constitute one Bhava Lagn. Divide the time of birth (in Ghatis, 
Vighatis etc.) from sunrise by 5 and add the quotient etc. to Sūrya‟s 
longitude, as at sunrise. This is called Bhava Lagn. 
4-5. Hora Lagn. Again from sunrise till the time of birth Hora Lagn repeats 
itself every 2½ Ghatis (i. e. 60 minutes). Divide the time past up to birth 
from sunrise by 2½ and add the quotient etc. in Rāśis, degrees and so on 
to the longitude of Sūrya, as at the sunrise. This will yield Hora Lagn in 
Rāśi, degrees etc. 
6-8. Ghati Lagn (Ghatik Lagn). Now listen to the method of working out 
Ghati Lagn. This Lagn changes along with every Ghati (24 minutes) from 
the sunrise. Note birth time in Ghatis and Vighatis. Consider the number of 
Ghatis past, as number of Rāśis, or Ghati Lagnas. The Vighatis be divided 
by 2 to arrive at degrees and minutes of arc, past in the said Ghati Lagn. 
The product so arrived in Rāśis, degrees and minutes be added to Sūrya‟s longitude, as at sunrise, to get the exact location of Ghati Lagn. So say 
Maharishis, like Narada. 
9. Use of Special Lagnas. Keeping the Grahas at birth, as it is, prepare 
various Bhava Kundalis with respect to each special Lagn and analyze, as 
done for the natal Lagn. 
10-13½. Varnad Dasha. I now detail Varnad Dasha, just by knowing which 
one can deal with the longevity of a native. If the natal Lagn is an odd Rāśi, 
count directly from Mesh to natal Lagn. If the natal Lagn is an even Rāśi, 
count from Meen to the natal Lagn in the reverse order. Similarly, if the 
Hora Lagn is an odd one, count from Mesh to Hora Lagn in direct order. If 
the Hora Lagn is an even one, count from Meen to Hora Lagn in the 
reverse order. If both the products are odd Rāśis, or even Rāśis, then add 
both the figures. If one is odd and the other is even, then know the 
difference between the two products. If the latest product in this process is 
an odd one, count so many Rāśis from Mesh in a direct manner; if an even 
one, count so many Rāśis from Meen in reverse order. The Rāśi so known 
will be the Varnad for Lagn. 
14-15. Effects of Varnad. Now listen to the use of the above. Out of the 
two, viz. natal Lagn and Hora Lagn, whichever is stronger, from there 
Varnad starts. If the natal Lagn is an odd Rāśi, the counting of Dashas is 
clockwise, otherwise anticlockwise. Lagn Dasha years will equal the 
number of Rāśis, intervening between the natal Lagn and Varnad. Similarly 
for other Bhavas. 
16-20. Effects of Varnad (cont.). Should a Kon from Lagn‟s Varnad be 
occupied, or drishtied by a malefic, the native will live only up to the Dasha 
of the said Rāśi. Just, as the Rudra Grah in Sool Dasha is capable of 
causing evils, the above-mentioned Grahas related to Varnad‟s Kon be 
treated. The Varnad Lagn be considered, as natal Lagn, while the 7th from 
Varnad will denote the longevity of the spouse, the 11th longevity of elder 
brothers and sisters, the 3rd longevity of younger brothers and sisters, the 
5th the longevity of sons, the 4th longevity of mother and the 9th longevity of 
father. The Dasha of the Sool Rāśi will inflict greater evils. 
21-24. Effects of Varnad (cont.). Similar assessments be made with 
reference to the Varnad of each Bhava, commencing the first, and the evils 
and goods due to a nativity be known. These Varnad Dashas are only for Bhavas (Rāśis) and not their occupants. The sub period of each Dasha will 
be one twelfth of the Dasha and the order will also be clockwise, or anti-
clockwise, as explained earlier. The natal Lagn is to be calculated 
according to birth place, while Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn etc. are common to 
all places. 
Ch. 6. The Sixteen Divisions of a Rāśi 
1. O Mahārishi Parāśar, I have known from you about the Grahas, Rāśis 
and their descriptions. I desire to know the details of various divisions of a 
Rāśi, will you please narrate. 
2-4. Names of the 16 Vargas. Lord Brahma has described 16 kinds of 
Vargas (Divisions) for each Rāśi. Listen to those. The names are Rāśi, 
Horā, Dreshkan, Chaturthāńś, Saptāńś, Navāńś, Dashāńś, Dvadashāńś, 
Shodashāńś, Vimshāńś, Chaturvimshāńś, Saptavimshāńś, Trimshāńś, 
Khavedāńś, Akshavedāńś and Shashtiāńś. 
5-6. Rāśi and Horā. The Rāśi, owned by a Grah, is called its Kshetra. The 
first half of an odd Rāśi is the Hora, ruled by Sūrya. While the second half 
is the Hora of Candr. The reverse is true in the case of an even Rāśi. Half 
of a Rāśi is called Hora. These are totally 24, counted from Mesh and 
repeated twice (at the rate of 12) in the whole of the zodiac. 
7-8. Dreshkan. One third of a Rāśi is called Dreshkan. These are totally 36, 
counted from Mesh, repeating thrice at the rate of 12 per round. The 1st, 5th 
and the 9th Rāśis from a Rāśi are its three Dreshkanas and are, 
respectively, lorded by Narada, Agasthya and Durvash. 
9. Chaturthāńś. The Lords of the 4 Kendras from a Rāśi are the rulers of 
respective Chaturthāńś of a Rāśi, commencing from Mesh. Each 
Chaturthāńś is one fourth of a Rāśi. The deities, respectively, are Sanak, 
Sanand, Kumar and Sanatan. 
10-11. Saptāńś. The Saptāńś (one seventh of a Rāśi) counting commences 
from the same Rāśi in the case of an odd Rāśi. It is from the seventh Rāśi 
thereof, while an even Rāśi is considered. The names of the seven 
divisions in odd Rāśis are Kshaar Ksheer, Dadhi, Ghrith, Ikshu, Ras, 
Madhya and Suddh Jal. These designations are reversed for an even Rāśi. 12. Navāńś. The Navāńś calculation are for a Movable Rāśi from there 
itself, for a Fixed Rāśi from the 9th thereof and for a Dual Rāśi from the 5th 
thereof. They go by designations Deva (divine), Manushya (human) and 
Rakshasa (devilish) in a successive and repetitive order for a Movable 
Rāśi. (Manushya, Rakshasa and Deva are the order for a Fixed Rāśi, while 
Rakshasa, Manushya and Deva are a Dual Rāśi‟s order) 
13-14. Dashāńś. Starting from the same Rāśi for an odd Rāśi and from the 
9th with reference to an even Rāśi, the 10 Dashāńśas, each of 3 degrees, 
are reckoned. These are presided over by the ten rulers of the cardinal 
directions, viz. Indra, Agni, Yama, Rakshasa, Varuna, Vayu, Kuber, Isan, 
Brahma and Ananth in case of an odd Rāśi. It is in the reverse order, that 
these presiding deities are reckoned, when an even Rāśi is given. 
15. Dvadashāńś. The reckoning of the Dvadashāńś (one twelfth of a Rāśi, 
or 2½ degrees each) commences from the same Rāśi. In each Rāśi the 
presidentship repeats thrice in the order of Ganesh, Ashvini Kumar, Yama 
and Sarpa for the 12 Dvadashāńśas. 
16. Shodashāńś (or Kalāńś). Starting from Mesh for a Movable Rāśi, from 
Simh for a Fixed Rāśi and from Dhanu for a Dual Rāśi, the 16 
Shodashāńśas (16th part of a Rāśi, i.e. of 1°52‟30”) are regularly 
distributed. The presiding deities of these repeat in the order Brahma, 
Vishnu, Shiva and Sūrya four times in the case of an odd Rāśi. It is reverse 
in the case of an even Rāśi, that these ruling deities are understood. 
17-21. Vimshāńś. From Mesh for a Movable Rāśi, from Dhanu for a Fixed 
Rāśi and from Simh for a Common Rāśi: this is how the calculations of 
Vimshāńśas (1/20th of a Rāśi, or 1°30‟ each) are to commence. The 
presiding deities of the 20 Vimshāńśas in an odd Rāśi are, respectively: 
Kali, Gauri, Jaya, Lakshmi, Vijaya, Vimal, Sati, Tara, Jvalamukhi, Sveta, 
Lalita, Bagalamukhi, Pratyangir, Shachi, Raudri, Bhavani, Varad, Jaya, 
Tripura and Sumukhi. In an even Rāśi these 20 deities, respectively, are 
Daya, Megha, Chinnasi, Pisachini, Dhumavathi, Matangi, Bal, Bhadr, Arun, 
Anal, Pingal, Chuchchuk, Ghora, Vaarahi, Vaishnavi, Sita, Bhuvanesvari, 
Bhairavi, Mangal and Aparajit. 
22-23. Chaturvimshāńś. The Chaturvimshāńś (1/24th part of a Rāśi, or 
1°15‟ each) distribution commences from Simh and Kark, respectively, for 
an odd and an even Rāśi. In the case of an odd Rāśi the ruling deities repeat twice in the order of Skand, Parusdhar, Anal, Vishwakarma, Bhag, 
Mitr, Maya, Antaka, Vrisha-Dwaja, Govinda, Madan and Bhima. Reverse 
these from Bhima twice to know the deities for the Chaturvimshāńś in an 
even Rāśi. 
24-26. Saptavimshāńś (Nakshatrāńś, or Bhāńś). The Saptavimshāńś Lords 
are, respectively, the presiding deities of the 27 Nakshatras, as under: 
Dastra (Ashvini Kumar), Yama, Agni, Brahma, Candr, Isa, Adhiti, Jiva, Ahi, 
Pitar, Bhag, Aryama, Sūrya, Tvasht, Marut, Chakragni, Mitr, Vasava, 
Rakshasa, Varuna, Vishwadeva, Govinda, Vasu, Varuna, Ajap, 
Ahirbuddhnya and Pushya. These are fo r an odd Rāśis. Count these 
deities in a reverse order for an even Rāśi. The Saptavimshāńś distribution 
commences from Mesh and other Movable Rāśis for all the 12 Rāśis. 
27-28. Trimshāńś. The Trimshāńś Lords for an odd Rāśi are Mangal, Śani, 
Guru, Budh and Śukr. Each of them in order rules 5, 5, 8, 7 and 5 degrees. 
The deities, ruling over the Trimshāńśas, are, respectively, Agni, Vayu, 
Indra, Kuber and Varuna. In the case of an even Rāśi the quantum of 
Trimshāńś, Grah lordship and deities get reversed. 
29-30. Khavedāńś (or Chatvarimshāńś, 1/40th part of a Rāśi). For odd 
Rāśis count from Mesh and for an even Rāśi from Tula in respect of 
Khavedāńśas (each of 45‟ of arc). Vishnu, Candr, Marichi, Tvasht, Dhata, 
Shiva, Ravi, Yama, Yaksh, Gandharv, Kaal and Varuna repeat 
successively, as presiding deities, in the same order for all Rāśis. 
31-32. Akshavedāńś (1/45th part of a Rāśi). Mesh, Simh and Dhanu are the 
Rāśis, from which the distributions, respectively, commence for Movable, 
Immovable and Common Rāśis. In Movable Rāśis Brahma, Shiva and 
Vishnu; in Immovable Rāśis Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma and in Common 
Rāśis Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva repeat 15 times the presidentship over 
these Akshavedāńśas. 
33-41. Shashtiāńś (1/60th part of a Rāśi, or half a degree each). To 
calculate the Shashtiāńś Lord ignore the Rāśi position of a Grah and take 
the degrees etc. it traversed in that Rāśi. Multiply that figure by 2 and divide 
the degrees by 12. Add 1 to the remainder, which will indicate the Rāśi, in 
which the Shashtiāńś falls. The Lord of that Rāśi is the Grah, ruling the said 
Shashtiāńś. In odd Rāśis the names of Shashtiāńśas are 1. Ghora, 2. 
Rakshasa, 3. Deva, 4. Kuber, 5. Yaksh, 6. Kindar, 7. Bhrasht, 8. Kulaghna, 9. Garal, 10. Vahni, 11. Maya, 12. Purishak, 13. Apampathi, 14. Marutwan, 
15. Kaal, 16. Sarpa, 17. Amrit, 18. Indu, 19. Mridu, 20. Komal, 21. 
Heramba, 22. Brahma, 23. Vishnu, 24. Maheshwara, 25. Deva, 26. Ardr, 
27. Kalinas, 28. Kshitees, 29. Kamalakar, 30. Gulik, 31. Mrityu, 32. Kaal, 
33. Davagni, 34. Ghora, 35. Yama, 36 Kantak, 37. Suddh, 38. Amrit, 39. 
PurnaCandr, 40. Vishadagdha, 41. Kulanas, 42. Vamshakshaya, 43. Utpat, 
44. Kaal, 45. Saumya, 46. Komal, 47. Sheetal, 48. Karaladamshtr, 49. 
Candramukhi, 50. Praveen, 51. Kaalpavak, 52. Dhannayudh, 53. Nirmal, 
54. Saumya, 55. Krur, 56. Atisheetal, 57. Amrit, 58. Payodhi, 59. Brahman, 
60. CandraRekha (InduRekha). The reverse is the order for even Rāśis in 
so much, as these names are cased. Grahas in benefic Shashtiāńśas 
produce auspicious, while the opposite is true in case of Grahas in malefic 
Shashtiāńśas. 
42-53. Varg Classification. Maitreya, explained now are the sum effects of 
classifications of different divisions (or Vargas, so far narrated). These are 
four kinds, viz. Shad Varg, Sapth Varg, Dasha Varg and Shodasha Varg. In 
the ShadVarg classification the Varg designations are Kimshuk, Vyanjan, 
Chamar, Chatr and Kundal, according to a Grah being in 2 to 6 
combinations of good Vargas. Next is the Sapth Varg, in which these 
classifications continue in the same manner up to six combinations of good 
Vargas, the 7th additional Varg getting classified, as Mukut. In the Dasha 
Varg scheme the designations commence from Parijata etc., such as 2 
good Vargas - Parijatha, 3 Uttama, 4 Gopur, 5 Simhasan, 6 Paravata, 7 
Devaloka, 8 Brahmaloka, 9 Sakravahana and 10 Vargas - Shridham. In the 
Shodasha Varg scheme the combinations of Vargas go with designations 
thus: two good Vargas - Bhedak, 3 Kusum, 4 Nagapushpa, 5 Kanduk, 6 
Kerala, 7 Kalpa Vriksha, 8 Chandan Vana, 9 PurnaCandr, 10 
Uchchaisrava, 11 Dhanvantari, 12 Sūryakant, 13 Vidrum, 14 Chakra-
Simhasan, 15 Golok and 16 Vargas - Śrī Vallabh. In these divisions the 
divisions, falling in the Grah‟s exaltation Rāśi, Mooltrikon Rāśi, own Rāśi 
and the Rāśis, owned by the Lord of a Kendra from the Arudha Lagn, are 
all to be considered (as good Vargas). The divisions of a combust Grah, 
defeated Grah, weak Grah and a Grah in bad Avasthas, like Sayan, be all 
ignored to be auspicious, for these destroy the good Yogas.  
Ch. 7. Divisional Considerations 
1-8. Use of the 16 Divisions. Now I will explain the use of these sixteen 
divisions. The physique from Lagn, wealth from Hora, happiness through co-born from Dreshkan, fortunes from Chaturthāńś, sons and grandsons 
from Saptāńś, spouse from Navāńś, power (and position) from Dashāńś, 
parents from Dvadashāńś, benefits and adversities through conveyances 
from Shodashāńś, worship from Vimshāńś, learning from Chaturvimshāńś, 
strength and weakness from Saptavimshāńś, evil effects from Trimshāńś, 
auspicious and inauspicious effects from Khavedāńś and all indications 
from both Akshavedāńś and Shashtiāńś: these are the considerations to be 
made through the respective Vargas. The Bhava, whose Lord is in a 
malefic Shashtiāńś, will diminish; so say Garga and others. The Bhava, 
whose Lord is in a benefic Shodashāńś, flourish. This is how the 16 Vargas 
are to be evaluated. 
9-12. After assessing the 20 point strength of the ascending degree, of 
other Bhavas and of the Grahas, the good and bad effects be declared. I 
explain below the method of knowing the Vimsopak strength (20 point 
strength), just by knowing which an idea of the results of actions of this 
birth and of former birth will clearly emerge. The Grahas from Sūrya on get 
full strength, when in exaltation, or in own Rāśi and are bereft of strength, 
when in the 7th (from exaltation). In between the strength be known by the 
rule of three process. In the case of a Grah, owning two Rāśis, distinction 
of placement in odd/even Rāśi identical with own Rāśi be made. 
13-16. Horā, Dreshkan and Trimshāńś Effects. Guru, Sūrya and Mangal 
give (pronounced) effects in the Hora of Sūrya. Candr, Śukr and Śani do 
so, when in Candr‟s Horas; Budh is effective in both the Horas. In the case 
of an even Rāśi the Hora of Candr will be powerful in effects, while Sūrya‟s 
Hora in an odd Rāśi will be so. Full, medium and nil will be the effects, 
respectively, in the beginning middle and the end of a Hora. Similar 
applications be made for a Dreshkan, Turyāńś, Navāńś etc. As for 
Trimshāńś effects, Sūrya is akin to Mangal and Candr is akin to Śukr. The 
effects, applicable to Rāśi, will apply to Trimshāńś. 
17-19. Vimshopak Bal. The Shad Vargas consist of Rāśi, Hora, Dreshkan, 
Navāńś, Dvadashāńś and Trimshāńś. The full Bal for each of the divisions, 
respectively, are 6, 2, 4, 5, 2 and 1. This is the Vimshopak Bal, relating to 
Shad Varg division. Adding the Saptāńś to the Shad Vargas, we get Sapt 
Varg, the Vimshopak Bal for which is 5, 2, 3, 2½, 4½, 2 and 1. These are 
gross strengths, while subtle ones should be understood by exact 
positions. 20. Add Dashāńś, Shodashāńś and Shashtiāńś to the said Sapt Varg 
Divisions to get the scheme of Dasha Varg. The Vimshopak Bal in this 
context is 3 for Rāśi, 5 for Shashtiāńś and for the other 8 divisions 1½ 
each. 
21-25. When the 16 divisions (Shodash Varg Scheme) are considered 
together, the Vimshopak score goes thus: Hora 1, Trimsāńś 1, Dreshkan 1, 
Shodashāńś 2, Navāńś 3, Rāśi 3½, Shashtiāńś 4 and the rest of the nine 
divisions each a half. The Vimshopak Bal remains as 20, only when the 
Grah is in own Bhava Vargas. Otherwise, the total strength from 20 
declines to 18 in Pramudit Vargas, to 15 in Shant Vargas, to 10 in Svasth 
divisions, to 7 in Duhkhit Vargas and to 5 in Khal Vargas. (These figures 
are called Varg Vishwa) 
26-27. Vimshopak Proportional Evaluation. Multiply the figure due to full 
strength for the division by the Varg Vishwa and divide by 20 to get the 
exact strength of the Grah. If the total is below 5, the Grah will not be 
capable of giving auspicious results. If it is above 5, but below 10, the Grah 
will yield some good effects. Later on up to 15 it is indicative of mediocre 
effect. A Grah with above 15 will yield wholly favourable effects. 
28-29. Other Sources of Strength. Maitreya, there are other kinds of 
sources, as I explain below. Grahas in the 7th from Sūrya will be fully 
effective. One with an identical longitude in comparison to Sūrya‟s will 
destroy the good effects. Rule of three process be applied to the Grah in 
between these positions. 
30-32. Dasha effects with Vimshopak Bal. Maitreya, after assessing the 
Vimshopak Bal through the various divisions, the rising and setting of the 
Grahas be considered. The Vimshopak Bal is classified under Purna, 
AtiPurna, Madhya, AtiMadhya, Heen, AtiHeen, Swalpa and AtiSwalp. Thus 
should be classified the Vimshopak Bal and the Dasha period results 
declared accordingly. 
33-36. Kendras, Konas etc. defined. O Maitreya, listen to other matters, 
which I am explaining. The Kendras are specially known, as Lagn (the 
ascendent), Bandhu Bhava, Yuvati Bhava (the descendant) and Karm 
Bhava (mid-heaven). Dhan, Putr, Randhr and Labh Bhava are Panapharas 
(succedents), while Sahaj, Ari, Dharm and Vyaya Bhava are called 
Apoklimas (cadents). Putr and Dharm Bhava are known by the name Kon (or trine). Evil Bhavas, or Dusthan Bhavas are Ari, Randhr and Vyaya 
Bhava. Chaturasras are Bandhu and Randhr Bhava. Sahaj, Ari, Karm and 
Labh Bhava are Upachaya Bhavas. 
37-38. Names of Bhavas. Thanu, Dhan, Sahaj, Bandhu, Putr, Ari, Yuvati, 
Randhr, Dharm, Karma, Labh and Vyaya are in order the names of 
Bhavas. I explained these briefly and leave it to you to grasp more, 
according to your intelligence. As delivered by Lord Brahma, some further 
information is added thus (i.e. in the following verses). 
39-43. Indications from Bhavas. Dharm Bhava and the 9th from Sūrya deal 
with one‟s father. Whatever effects are to be known from the Karm and 
Labh Bhava, be also known from similar Bhavas, counted from Sūrya. 
Whatever results are to be known from Bandhu, Tanu, Dhan, Labh and 
Dharm should also be known from the 4th of Candr, from Kark Rāśi itself 
and from the 2nd, 11th and 9th from Candr, respectively. Whatever has to be 
known through Sahaj Bhava, be also analyzed through the 3rd from Mangal. 
The 6th from Budh be also considered in regard to indications, derivable 
from Ari Bhava. The 5th from Guru, the 7th from Śukr and both the 8th and 
12th from Śani stand for consideration, respectively, in respect of offspring, 
spouse and death. The Lord of the Bhava is equally important, when 
estimating the indications of a particular Bhava. 
Ch. 8. Drishtis of the Rāśis 
1-3. Rāśi Drishtis. O Maitreya, now detailed are the Drishtis, emanating 
from the Rāśi Mesh etc. Every Movable Rāśi drishties the 3 Fixed Rāśis, 
leaving the Fixed Rāśi adjacent to it. Every Fixed Rāśi gives Drishti to the 3 
Movable Rāśis, barring the adjacent Movable Rāśi. And a Common Rāśi 
gives a Drishti to the other three Common Rāśis. The Grah in a Rāśi gives 
the same Drishti, as the Rāśi (in which the Grah is) does. 
4-5. Dristhis of the Grahas. A Grah in a Movable Rāśi gives a Drishti to the 
other 3 Fixed Rāśis, leaving the Fixed Rāśi next to it. A Grah in a Fixed 
Rāśi does not give a Drishti to the next Movable Rāśi, but the remaining 3 
Movable Rāśis. The one in a Common Rāśi gives a Drishti to the remaining 
3 Common Rāśis. Simultaneously a Grah in the Rāśi, that receives a 
Drishti, is also subjected to the Drishti concerned. 6-9. Diagram of Dristhis. As depicted by Lord Brahma, I now narrate the 
diagram of Drishtis, so that Drishtis are easily understood by a mere sight 
of the diagram. Draw a square, or a circle marking the 8 directions (4 
corners and 4 quarters thereof). Mark the zodiacal Rāśis, as under: Mesh 
and Vrishabh in East, Mithun in the North-East, Kark and Simh in the North, 
Kanya in the North-West, Tula and Vrischik in the West, Dhanu in the 
South-West, Makar and Kumbh in the South and Meen in the South-East. 
Addition Santhanam till Ch. 9. The Drishtis (as per the earlier Slokas) can 
be shown in a square diagram, or circular diagram (as per convenience). 
Ch. 9. Evils at Birth 
1. O Brahmin, first of all estimate the evils and checking factors thereof 
through Lagn and then declare the effects of the 12 Bhavas. 
2. Evils, causing premature end, exist up to the 24th year of one‟s age. As 
such, no definite calculation of life span should be made till such year of 
age. 
3-6. Short-life Combinations (up to Sloka 23). Should Candr be in Ari, 
Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava and receives a Drishti from a malefic, the child will 
die soon. If in the process there be a Drishti from a benefic, it may live up to 
8. If a benefic is retrograde in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, receiving a 
Drishti from a malefic, death will occur within a month of birth. This is true, 
only when Lagn is not occupied by a benefic. Should Putr Bhava be 
occupied by Śani, Mangal and Sūrya jointly, (early) death of mother and 
brother will come to pass. Mangal, placed in Tanu, or in Randhr Bhava and 
be yuti with Śani, or Sūrya, or receiving a Drishti from a malefic, being 
bereft of a Drishti from a benefic, will prove a source of (immediate) death. 
7-11. If Śani and Mangal give a Drishti to Lagn, as the luminaries are yuti 
with Rahu (elsewhere), the child will live a fortnight. Immediate death of the 
child along with its mother will occur, if Śani is in Karm Bhava, Candr in Ari 
Bhava and Mangal in Yuvati Bhava. One will immediately go to the abode 
of Yama, if Śani is in Tanu Bhava, while Candr and Guru are in their order 
in Randhr and Sahaj Bhava. Only a month will be the span of one‟s life, 
who had Sūrya in Dharm Bhava, Mangal in Yuvati Bhava and Guru and 
Śukr in Labh Bhava. All Grahas (any Grah) in Vyaya Bhava will be the source of a short life, specifically the luminaries, Śukr and Rahu. But the 
Drishti of these four Grahas (on Vyaya Bhava) will counteract such evils. 
12. Candr is capable of causing early end, if she is with a malefic in Yuvati, 
Randhr, or Tanu Bhava and unrelated to a benefic. 
13. Early death will come to pass, if there be a birth in the morning, or 
evening junctions, or in a Hora, ruled by Candr, or in Gandanta, while 
Candr and malefics occupy Kendras from Lagn. 
14. Definition of Sandhya. 3 Ghatis before the sight of the semi disc (half) 
of the rising Sūrya and a similar duration, following Sūrya‟s set, are called, 
as morning twilight and evening twilight, respectively. 
15. Early Death. Should all the malefics be in the oriental half, while 
benefics are in the occidental half, early death of one born in Vrischik, will 
follow. In this case there is no need of any rethinking. 
16. Malefic in Vyaya and Ari Bhava, or in Randhr and Dhan Bhava, while 
Lagn is hemmed between other malefics, will bring early death. 
17. Malefics, occupying Tanu and Yuvati Bhava, while Candr is yuti with a 
malefic with no relief from a benefic, will also cause premature death. 
18. Early death will be inflicted on the native, if decreasing Candr is in Tanu 
Bhava, while malefics capture Randhr Bhava and a Kendra. There is no 
doubt  about that. 
19. Candr in Tanu, Randhr, Vyaya, or Yuvati Bhava and hemmed between 
malefics will confer premature death. 
20. Should Candr be in Tanu Bhava, hemmed between malefics, while 
Yuvati, or Randhr Bhava has a malefic in it, he will face immediate death 
along with his mother. 
21. Should Śani, Sūrya and Mangal be in Vyaya, Dharm and Randhr Bhava 
without Drishti from a benefic, the child will face instant death. 
22. With a malefic in Yuvati Bhava, or in the rising Dreshkan, while 
decreasing Candr is in Tanu Bhava, death be experienced early. 23. The life span of the child will be either 2 months, or 6 months only, if all 
Grahas devoid of strength are relegated to Apoklima Bhavas. 
24. Evils to Mother (up to Sloka 33). The mother of the native will incur evils 
(will die soon), if Candr at birth receives a Drishti from three malefics. 
Benefics, giving a Drishti to Candr, will bring good to the mother. 
25. Should Dhan Bhava be occupied by Rahu, Budh, Śukr, Sūrya and Śani, 
the child‟s birth has been after its father‟s death, while even the mother will 
face early death. 
26. If Candr is in the 7th, or the 8th from a malefic, be herself with a malefic 
and receives a Drishti from a strong malefic, predict mothers end to be 
early. 
27. The child will not live on mother‟s milk, but on that of she-goat, if Sūrya 
is exalted, or debilitated in Yuvati Bhava. 
28. Should a malefic be in the 4th, identical with an inimical Rāśi, counted 
from Candr, while there is no benefic in a Kendra, the child will lose its 
mother in a premature manner. 
29. Malefics in Ari and Vyaya Bhava will bring evils to mother. The child‟s 
father will receive similar effects, if Bandhu and Karm Bhava are captured 
by malefics. 
30. Budh in Dhan Bhava, while malefics occupy Tanu and Vyaya Bhava: 
this Yoga will destroy the entire family. 
31. Guru, Śani and Rahu, respectively, posited in Tanu, Dhan and Sahaj 
Bhava will cause mother‟s death early. 
32. Doubtlessly the mother will give up the child, if it has malefics in Konas, 
counted from the decreasing Candr. No benefic shall be yuti with the said 
malefics. 
33. If Mangal and Śani are together in a Kendra with reference to Candr 
and occupy one and the same Navāńś, the child will have two mothers. Yet 
it will be short-lived. 34. Evil to Father (up to Sloka 42). One‟s father will incur early death, if 
Śani, Mangal and Candr in their orders are in Tanu, Yuvati and Ari Bhava. 
35. The native will at the time of his marriage lose his father, if Guru is in 
Tanu Bhava, while Śani, Sūrya, Mangal and Budh are together in Dhan 
Bhava. 
36. Early loss of father will take place, if Sūrya is with a malefic, or is 
hemmed between malefics, as there is another malefic in the 7th from 
Sūrya. 
37. Remote will be the possibility of one‟s father sustaining, if Sūrya is in 
Yuvati, while Mangal is in Karm and Rahu is in Vyaya Bhava. 
38. Early and troubled will be one‟s father‟s death, if Mangal is in Karm 
Bhava identical with his enemy‟s Rāśi. 
39. Candr in Ari Bhava, Śani in Tanu Bhava and Mangal in Yuvati Bhava: 
this array of heavenly bodies at birth will not ensure a long span of life for 
the father. 
40. If Sūrya receives a Drishti from Śani and be in Mesh, or in Vrischik 
Navāńś, the father would have given up the family before birth of the child, 
or would have passed away. 
41. If Bandhu, Karm and Vyaya Bhava are all occupied by malefics, both 
the parents will leave the child to its own fate and wander from place to 
place. 
42. The father will not see the native till his (the native‟s) 23rd year, if Rahu 
and Guru are together in an inimical Rāśi identical with Tanu, or Bandhu 
Bhava. 
43-45. Parents. Sūrya is the indicator of father for all beings, while the 
mother is indicated by Candr. Should Sūrya receive a Drishti from one, or 
more malefics, or be hemmed between them, this will cause evils to father. 
Similarly Candr be considered in respect of mother. Malefics in the 6th, the 
8th, or the 4th from Sūrya will bring inauspicious results about the father. 
Malefics in such places from Candr will be adverse for the mother. The 
strength, or otherwise of the occupants concerned be suitably estimated. Ch. 10. Antidotes for Evils 
1. Those are the evils (due to a native). I now narrate the antidotes for such 
evils as well, which will be helpful to assess the extent of inauspiciousness. 
2. Should one among Budh, Guru and Śukr be in an angle from Lagn, all 
evils are destroyed, as Sūrya eliminates darkness. 
3. Just as a single reverential obeisance before Lord Shiva, the Trident 
holder frees one from all sins, a single, but strong Guru in Lagn will ward off 
all the evils. 
4. Lagn Lord is singly capable of counteracting all evils, if he is strongly 
placed in an angle, just as Lord Shiva, the holder of the Bow destroyed the 
three cities, built of gold, silver and iron for the demons by Maya. 
5. All evils are destroyed, if a benefic drishties Lagn of one born during the 
night in the bright half. Similarly a malefic‟s Drishti on Lagn of one born 
during day time in the dark half. 
6. Sūrya in Vyaya will confer a hundred-year life span on one born in Tul 
Lagn.  
7. It will prove auspicious for the mother as well as the native, if Mangal 
joins, or is drishtied by Guru. 
8. If malefics are surrounded by benefics, while angles, or trines are 
themselves benefic-occupied, evils disappear soon. Not only this, evils will 
not follow from the Bhavas concerned. 
Ch. 11. Judgement of Bhavas 
1. O Maharishi Parashar, I have come to know of the evils and antidotes 
thereof from you. Please tell me, what is to be deduced from each Bhava. 
2. Indications of Tanu Bhava. Maharishi Parashar replies. Physique, 
appearance, intellect (or the organ of intelligence, i.e. brain), complexion of 
the body, vigour, weakness, happiness, grief and innate nature are all to be 
guessed through the ascending Rāśi. 3. Indications of Dhan Bhava. Wealth, grains (food etc.), family, death, 
enemies, metals, precious stones etc. are to be understood through Dhan 
Bhava. 
4. Indications of Sahaj Bhava. From Sahaj Bhava know of the following: 
valour, servants (attending etc.), brothers, sisters etc., initiatory instructions 
(Upadesh), journey and parent‟s death. 
5. Indications of Bandhu Bhava. Conveyances, relatives, mother, 
happiness, treasure, lands and buildings are to be consulted through 
Bandhu Bhava. 
6. Indications of Putr Bhava. The learned should deduce from Putr Bhava 
amulets, sacred spells, learning, knowledge, sons, royalty (or authority), fall 
of position etc. 
7. Indications of Ari Bhava. Maternal uncle, doubts about death, enemies, 
ulcers, step-mother etc. are to be estimated from Ari Bhava. 
8. Indications of Yuvati Bhava. Wife, travel, trade, loss of sight, death etc. 
be known from Yuvati Bhava. 
9. Indications of Randhr Bhava. Randhr Bhava indicates longevity, battle, 
enemies, forts, wealth of the dead and things, that have happened and are 
to happen (in the past and future births). 
10. Indications of Dharm Bhava. Fortunes, wife‟s brother, religion, brother‟s 
wife, visits to shrines etc. be known from Dharm Bhava. 
11. Indications of Karm Bhava. Royalty (authority), place, profession 
(livelihood), honour, father, living in foreign lands and debts are to be 
understood from Karm Bhava. 
12. Indications of Labh Bhava. All articles, son‟s wife, income, prosperity, 
quadrupeds etc. are to be understood from Labh Bhava. 
13. Indications of Vyaya Bhava. From Vyaya Bhava, one can know about 
expenses, history of enemies, one‟s own death etc. 
14-16. Prosperity, or Annihilation of a Bhava. Predict prosperity of the 
Bhava, which is yuti with, or drishtied by a benefic. Also, when its Lord is in Yuvavastha, or Prabuddhavastha, or in Kismaravastha, or in Karm Bhava, 
the Bhavas well-being is indicated. The Bhava, which is not drishtied by its 
Lord, or, whose Lord is with a malefic Grah, or with one of the Lords of evil 
and such other Bhavas (i.e. 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th and 12th), or is defeated in a 
war between Grahas, or is in one of the three Avasthas, viz, Vriddhavastha, 
Mritavastha and Suptavastha. 
Ch. 12. Effects of Tanu Bhava 
1-2. Physical comforts. Should Lagn Lord be yuti with a malefic, or be in 
Randhr, 6th, or 12th, physical felicity will diminish. If he is in an angle, or 
trine there will be at all times comforts of the body. If Lagn Lord is in 
debilitation, combustion, or enemy‟s Rāśi, there will be diseases. With a 
benefic in an angle, or trine all diseases will disappear. Lagn‟s angles (i.e. 
Bandhu, Yuvati, or the 10th), or its trine (Putr, Dharm), containing a benefic, 
is a powerful remedy for all, related to health. 
3. There will not be bodily health, if Lagn, or Candr be drishtied by, or yuti 
with a malefic, being devoid of a benefics Drishti. 
4. Bodily Beauty. A benefic in Lagn will give a pleasing appearance, while a 
malefic will make one bereft of good appearance. Felicity of the body will 
be enjoyed, if Lagn is drishtied by, or yuti with a benefic. 
5-7. Other Benefits. If Lagn Lord, Budh, Guru, or Śukr be in an angle, or in 
a trine, the native will be long lived, wealthy, intelligent and liked by the 
king. Fame, wealth, abundant pleasures and comforts of the body will b e 
acquired, if Lagn Lord is in a Movable Rāśi and be drishtied by a benefic 
Grah. One will be endowed with royal marks (of fortune), if Budh, Guru, or 
Śukr be in Lagn along with the Candr, or be in angle from Lagn. If Budh, 
Guru, or Śukr be in 4th, 7th, or 10th from Lagn, or be in the company of 
Candr in Lagn, the native will enjoy royal fortunes. 
8. Coiled Birth. If there be a birth in one of Mesh, Vrishabh and Simh 
Lagnas, containing either Śani, or Mangal, the birth of the child is with a coil 
around a limb. The corresponding limb will be in accordance with the Rāśi, 
or Navāńś, rising. 
9. Birth of Twins. The native, who has Sūrya in a quadruped Rāśi, while 
others are in Dual Rāśis with strength, is born, as one of the twins. 10. To Be Nurtured by Three Mothers. If Sūrya and Candr join in one and 
the same Bhava and fall in one Navāńś, the native will be nurtured by three 
different mothers for the first three months from its birth and will later on be 
brought up by its father and brother. („Bhratri‟ apart from meaning a brother 
calls for interpretation, as a near relative in general) 
11. Important. The learned in Jyotish should base the effects on Candr 
also, as are applicable to Lagn. Now explained are clues to know of ulcers, 
identity marks etc. on one‟s person. 
12-14. Decanates and Bodily Limbs. Head, eyes, ears, nose, temple, chin 
and face is the order of limbs, denoted (by the various Bhavas), when the 
first decanate of a Rāśi ascends. In the case of the second decanate 
ascending the order is neck, shoulder, arm, side, heart, stomach and navel. 
The order for the third decanate ascending is pelvis, anus/penis, testicles, 
thigh, knee, calf and foot. The portion already risen indicates left side of the 
body (while the one yet to rise, i.e. the invisible half, denotes the right side 
of the body). 
15. Limbs Affected. The limb, related to a malefic by occupation, will have 
ulcers, or scars, while the one, related to a benefic, will have a mark (like 
moles etc). So say the Jyotishis. (Also see Sloka 6, Ch. 4 of Saravali, which 
states, that a malefic, or a benefic, if be in own Rāśi, or Navāńś, the effects 
will be right from birth. In other cases it will be in the course of one‟s life, 
that these effects will come to pass) 
Ch. 13. Effects of Dhan Bhava 
1-2. Combinations for Wealth. O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me, 
speaking on the effects of Dhan Bhava. If the Lord of Dhan is in Dhan, or is 
in an angle, or in trine, he will promote one‟s wealth (or monetary state). 
Should he be in Ari/8th/12th, financial conditions will decline. A benefic in 
Dhan will give wealth, while a malefic instead will destroy wealth. 
3. One will be wealthy, if Guru is in Dhan, as the Lord of Dhan, or is with 
Mangal. 
4. If Dhan Lord is in Labh, while the Lord of Labh in Dhan, wealth will be 
acquired by the native. Alternately these two Lords may join in an angle, or 
in a trine. 5. If the Lord of Dhan is in an angle, while Labh Lord is in a trine thereof, or 
is drishtied by, or yuti with Guru and Śukr, the subject will be wealthy. 
6-7. Yogas for Poverty. One will be penniless, if the Lord of Dhan Bhava is 
in an evil Bhava, while the Lord of Labh Bhava is also so placed and Dhan 
Bhava is occupied by a malefic. There will be penury right from birth and 
the native will have to beg even for his food, if the Lords of Dhan and Labh 
Bhava are both combust, or with malefics. 
8. Loss of Wealth through the King. Should the Lords of Dhan and Labh 
Bhava be relegated to Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, while Mangal is in 
Labh Bhava and Rahu is in Dhan Bhava, the native will lose his wealth on 
account of royal punishments. 
9. Expenses on Good Accounts. When Guru is in Labh, Śukr is in Dhan 
and a benefic is placed in Vyaya Bhava, while Dhan‟s Lord is yuti with a 
benefic, there will be expenses on religious, or charitable grounds. 
10. Fame etc. If Dhan‟s Lord is in own Rāśi, or is exalted, the native will 
look after his people, will help others and also will become famous. 
11. Effortless Aquisition. If Dhan‟s Lord is yuti with a benefic and is in a 
good division, like Paravatāńś, there will be effortlessly all kinds of wealth in 
the native‟s family. (“Paravatāńśdau” of the text denotes Paravat, or such 
other higher Vargas: Dhan‟s Lord should be in Paravatāńś, or in 
Devalokāńś, Brahmalokāńś, Sakravahanāńś, or Sridhamāńś in the Dash 
Varg scheme) 
12. Eyes. If Dhan Lord is endowed with strength, the native will possess 
beautiful eyes. Should the said Grah be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, 
there will be disease, or deformity of eyes. 
13. Untruthful Person. If Dhan Bhava and its Lord are yuti with malefics, the 
native will be a talebearer, will speak untruth and will be afflicted by windy 
diseases. 
Ch. 14. Effects of Sahaj Bhava 
1. O Brahmin, I now tell you about Sahaj Bhava. Should Sahaj Bhava be 
yuti with, or drishtied by a benefic, the native will be endowed with co-born 
and be courageous. 2. If Sahaj‟s Lord along with Mangal drishties Sahaj Bhava, the native will 
enjoy good results, due to Sahaj Bhava. Alternatively these two Grahas 
may be in Sahaj itself. 
3. Destruction at once of co-born will come to pass, if the said 2 Grahas are 
together with a malefic, or in a Rāśi, owned by a malefic. 
4-4½. Female and Male Co-born. If Sahaj‟s Lord is a female Grah, or, if 
Sahaj Bhava be occupied by female Grahas, one will have sisters, born 
after him. Similarly male Grahas and male Rāśis denote younger brothers. 
Should it be of mixed nature, co-born of both sexes will be obtained. These 
effects be declared after assessing the strength and weakness of the 
concerned. 
5-6. Should Sahaj‟s Lord and Mangal be together in Randhr Bhava, 
destruction of co-born will result. Happiness in this respect will come to 
pass, if Mangal, or Sahaj‟s Lord is in an angle, or in a trine, or in exaltation, 
or friendly divisions. 
7-11. Number of Brothers and Sisters. If Budh is in Sahaj Bhava, while 
Sahaj‟s Lord and Candr are together, as the indicator (Mangal) joins Śani, 
the effects are: there occurred the birth of an elder sister and there will be 
younger brothers. Furthermore, the third brother will die. Should Mangal be 
yuti with Rahu, while Sahaj‟s Lord is in his debilitation Rāśi, there will be 
loss of younger brothers and/or sisters, while three elder brothers and/or 
sisters were attained by the native. If Sahaj‟s Lord is in an angle, while t he 
significator (Mangal) is exalted in a trine and be yuti with Guru, 12 will be 
the number of total co-born. Out of these two elders and the 3rd, the 7th, the 
9th and the 12th of the younger co-born will be shortlived, while six of the 
said twelve will be longlived. 
12-13. There will be 1 co-born, if Vyaya‟s Lord (some texts read, as Labh‟s 
Lord) joins Mangal and Guru, while Sahaj Bhava is occupied by Candr. If 
Candr is lonely placed in Sahaj Bhava with Drishti of male Grahas, there 
will be younger brothers, while the Drishti of Śukr denotes younger sisters. 
14. Adverse Grahas. Sūrya in Sahaj Bhava will destroy the preborn. The 
afterborn will be destroyed, if Śani is found in Sahaj Bhava. In the same 
situation Mangal will destroy both the preborn and later-born. 15. After estimating the strength and weakness of such Yogas, the effects, 
related to brothers and sisters, be announced. 
Ch. 15. Effects of Bandhu Bhava 
1. O excellent of the Brahmins, thus have been briefly told the effects of 
Sahaj Bhava. Now listen to the results, related to Bandhu Bhava. 
2. Housing Comforts. One will have residential comforts in full degree, if 
Bandhu is occupied by its Lord, or by Lagn‟s Lord and be drishtied by a 
benefic. 
3. Miscellaneous. Should Putr‟s Lord be in his own Bhava, or in own 
Navāńś, or in exaltation, the native will be endowed with comforts, related 
to lands, conveyances, houses etc. and musical instruments. 
4. Housing Comforts. If Karm‟s Lord joins Bandhu‟s Lord in an angle, or in 
a trine, the native will acquire beautiful mansions. 
5. Relatives. Should Budh be in Lagn, while Bandhu‟s Lord, being a 
benefic, is drishtied by another benefic, the native will be honoured by his 
relatives. 
6. Long-living Mother. If Bandhu Bhava is occupied by a benefic, while its 
Lord is in his exaltation Rāśi, as the indicator of mother is endowed with 
strength, the native will have a long-living mother. 
7. Happiness of Mother. The native‟s mother will be happy, if Bandhu‟s 
Lord is in an angle, while Śukr is also in an angle, as Budh is exalted. 
8. Quadrupeds. Sūrya in Bandhu, Candr and Śani in Dharm and Mangal in 
Labh Bhava; this Yoga will confer cows and buffaloes on the native. 
9. Dumbness. Should Bandhu Bhava be a Movable one, while its Lord and 
Mangal are together in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will be dumb. 
10-14. Conveyances. If Lagn‟s Lord is a benefic, while Bandhu‟s Lord is in 
fall, or in Labh Bhava and the significator (Śukr) is in Vyaya Bhava, the 
native will obtain conveyances in his 12th year. Should Sūrya be in Bandhu 
Bhava, as Bandhu‟s Lord is exalted and be with Śukr, one will acquire 
conveyances in his 32nd year. It will be in the 42nd year, that one will be endowed with conveyances, if Bandhu‟s Lord joins Karm‟s Lord in his (4th 
Lord‟s) exaltation Navāńś. An exchange between Labh‟s and Bandhu‟s 
Lords will confer conveyances in the 12th year. A benefic, related to Bandhu 
Bhava (and to its Lord), will bring with him auspicious effects (regarding 
conveyances), while a malefic will produce only malefic effects (in respec t 
of conveyances). Should a benefic be in Bandhu, drishti Bandhu, or in yuti 
with the Lord of Bandhu, or a Drishti on the Lord of Bandhu Bhava, then the 
native will be happy with conveyances and be free from accidents and 
dangers. A malefic, replacing the said benefic, will cause losses, 
concerning vehicles and reduce one to severe accidents. 
Ch. 16. Effects of Putr Bhava 
1-3. O Brahmin, now I tell you the effects, related to Putr Bhava. If the 
Lords of Lagn and Putr are in their own Rāśis, or in an angle, or in a trine, 
one will enjoy thorough happiness through his children. Should Putr‟s Lord 
be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be no offspring. Should the 
Lord of Putr be combust, or be with malefics and be weak, there will be no 
children; even, if per chance issues are obtained, they will only quit the 
world soon. The Yuti of Putr‟s Lord with Lagn‟s Lord in a good Bhava will 
ensure early obtainment of children apart from happiness through them. If 
they join in an evil Bhava, they will prove a defect in this respect. 
4. If Putr‟s Lord is in Ari Bhava, as Lagn‟s Lord is yuti with Mangal, the 
native will lose his very first child, whereafter his female will not be fertile to 
yield an offspring. 
5. Should Putr‟s Lord be in fall in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, while Budh 
and Ketu are in Putr Bhava, the native‟s wife will give birth to one child 
only. 
6. If Putr‟s Lord is in fall and be not in Drishti to Putr, while Śani and Budh 
are in Putr, the native‟s wife will give birth to one child only. 
7. Should Dharm‟s Lord be in Lagn, while Putr‟s Lord is in fall and Ketu is in 
Putr along with Budh, obtainment of progeny will be after a great deal of 
ordeal. 
8. If Putr‟s Lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or be in an inimical Rāśi, 
or be in fall, or in Putr itself, the native will beget issues with difficulty. 9. Should Putr Bhava be owned by Śani, or Budh and be occupied, or 
drishtied by Śani and Mandi, one will have adopted issues. 
10. Should Sūrya and Candr be together in a Rāśi and in the same 
Navāńś, the native will be brought up by three mothers, or two fathers. 
11. Adopted issue is indicated, if Putr is tenanted by six Grahas, while its 
Lord is in Vyaya Bhava and Candr and Lagn are endowed with strength. 
12. There will be many children, if Putr‟s Lord is strong, while Putr is 
drishtied by strong Budh, Guru and Śukr. 
13. If Putr‟s Lord is with Candr, or is in her Decanate, the native will beget 
daughters; so say Jyotishis. 
14. If Putr‟s Lord is in a Movable Rāśi, while Śani is in Putr, as Rahu is with 
Candr, the child (so born) is of questionable birth. 
15. Undoubtedly the native is born of other‟s loins, if Candr is in the 8th from 
Lagn, while Guru is in the 8th from Candr. Malefic‟s Drishti, or Yuti is 
essential in this Yog. 
16. If Putr‟s Lord is exalted, or be in Dhan, Putr, or Dharm Bhava, or be yuti 
with, or drishtied by Guru, obtainment of children will be there. 
17. One will obtain children, that will indulge in mean deeds, if Putr is 
occupied by three, or four malefics, while Putr‟s Lord is in fall. A benefic 
(including Budh) in Putr is excluded in the said combination. 
18. If Putr is occupied by Guru, while its Lord is with Śukr, one will obtain 
an offspring in his 32nd, or 33rd year. 
19. Should Putr‟s Lord be in an angle along with Guru, the Karak, one will 
beget a child at the age of 30, or 36. 
20. If Guru is in Dharm Bhava, while Śukr is in the 9th from Guru along with 
Lagn‟s Lord, one will beget a child at the age of 40. 
21. The native will at the age of 32 lose his child, if Rahu is in Putr, Putr‟s 
Lord is in Yuti with a malefic and Guru is in debilitation. 22. There will be loss of children at 33 and 36, if a malefic is in the 5th from 
Guru, while another is in the 5th from Lagn. 
23. Should Mandi be in Lagn, while Lagn‟s Lord is in fall, grief on account 
of loss of child at the age of 56 will come to pass. 
24-32. Number of Children. There will be 10 sons, if Bandhu Bhava and Ari 
Bhava are occupied by malefics, while Putr‟s Lord is in deep exaltation, 
joining Lagn‟s Lord, as Guru is with another benefic. Nine will be the 
number of sons, that one will beget, if Guru is in deep exaltation, as Rahu 
is with Dhan‟s Lord and Dharm is occupied by its own Lord. There will be 
eight sons, if Guru is in Putr, or Dharm Bhava, while Putr‟s Lord is endowed 
with strength and Dhan‟s Lord is in Karm Bhava. Śani in Dharm Bhava, 
while Putr‟s Lord is in Putr itself, gives 7 sons, out of which twins will be 
born twice. If Putr‟s Lord is in Putr in Yuti with Dhan‟s Lord, there will be 
birth of 7 sons, out of which 3 will pass away. Only one son is denoted, if 
there be a malefic in Putr Bhava, while Guru is in the 5th from Śani, or vice 
versa. If Putr Bhava has a malefic in it, or, if Śani is in the 5th from Guru, the 
native will beget offspring only through his second, or third wife. Should 
Putr be occupied by a malefic, while Guru is yuti with Śani in Putr Bhava, 
as Lagn‟s Lord is in Dhan Bhava and Putr‟s Lord is yuti with Mangal, one 
will live long, but lose his children one after the other, as they are born. 
Ch. 17. Effects of Ari Bhava 
1. O Brahmin, following are the effects, produced by Ari Bhava, relating to 
diseases, ulcers etc. Listen to this attentively. 
2. Ulcers/Bruises. Should Ari‟s Lord be in Ari itself, or in Lagn, or Randhr, 
there will be ulcers, or bruises on the body. The Rāśi, becoming Ari Bhava, 
will lead to the knowledge of the concerned limb. 
3-5. Relatives Affected. The Karak of a relative, or the Lord of such a 
Bhava, joining Ari‟s Lord, or being in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, indicates 
ulcers/bruises to such a relative, like father. Sūrya with such lordship and in 
such a Bhava denotes such affectation of head, Candr of the face, Mangal 
of the neck, Budh of the navel, Guru of the nose, Śukr of the eyes, Śani of 
the feet and the Rahu and Ketu of the abdomen. 6. Facial Diseases. Should Lagn‟s Lord be in a Rāśi of Mangal, or of Budh 
and has a Drishti on Budh, there will be diseases of the face. 
7-8½. Leprosy. Mangal, or Budh, having ownership of the ascending Rāśi 
and joining Candr, Rahu and Śani, will cause leprosy. If Candr is in Lagn, 
which is not however Cancer, and be with Rahu, there will occur white 
leprosy. Śani in place of Rahu will cause black leprosy, while Mangal 
similarly will afflict one with blood-leprosy. 
9-12½. Diseases in General. When Lagn is occupied by the Lords of Ari 
and Randhr Bhava along with Sūrya, the native will be afflicted by fever 
and tumours. Mangal, replacing Sūrya, will cause swelling and hardening of 
the blood vessels and wounds and hits by weapons. Budh so featuring will 
bring in billious diseases, while Guru in similar case will destroy any 
disease. Similarly Śukr will cause diseases through females, Śani windy 
diseases, Rahu danger through low-caste-men and Ketu navel diseases. 
Candr in Yuti with the Lords of Ari and Randhr Bhava will inflict dangers 
through water and phlegmatic disorders. Similar estimates be made from 
the respective significators and Bhavas for relatives, like father. 
13-19½ TIMING OF ILLNESS. The native will be afflicted by illness 
throughout life, if Śani is with Rahu, while Ari Lord and 6th Bhava are yuti 
with malefics. One will suffer from (severe) fever at the age of 6 and at the 
age of 12, if Mangal is in Ari, while Ari Lord is in Randhr. If the Candr is in 
Dhanu/Meen, while Guru is in Ari from Lagn, one will suffer from leprosy at 
the age of 19 and 22. If Rahu is in Ari, Lagna Lord is in Randhr and Mandi 
is in an angle, consumption will trouble the native at the age of 26. 
Spleenary disorders will be experienced at the age of 29 and 30, if the 
Lords of 6th and 12th are in exchange of their Rāśis. Śani and Candr 
together in Ari will inflict blood-leprosy at the age of 45. If Śani is with an 
inimical planet, while Lagn Lord is in Lagn itself, windy disorders (like 
rheumatism) will trouble the native at the age of 59. 
20-22. UNFORTUNATE YEARS. Should Candr be yuti with Ari Lord, while 
the 8th Lord is in Ari and the 12th Lord is in Lagn, the native will be troubled 
by animals at the age of eight. O Brahmin, if Rahu is in Ari, while Śani is in 
Randhr from the said Rahu, the child will have danger through fire at the 
age of 1 and 2, while in Sahaj year birds will bring some evils. 23-25. UNFORTUNATE YEARS (continued). Danger through water will 
have to be feared during Putr and Dharm years, if Sūrya is in Ari, or 
Randhr, while Candr is in Vyaya from the said Sūrya. Śani in Randhr, as 
Mangal is in Yuvati, all cause sma ll-pox in Karm year and in 30th year of 
age. If 8th Lord joins Rahu in an angle/trine from Randhr Bhava and be in 
Randhr in Navamsa, the subject will be troubled by swelling of blood 
vessels, urinary disorders etc. during the 18th year and the 22nd year. 
26. LOSS THROUGH ENEMIES. Loss of wealth will come to pass during 
the 31st year, if Labh and 6th Lords exchange their Rāśis. 
27. INIMICAL SONS. One‟s own sons will be his enemies, if Putr Lord is in 
Ari, while Ari Lord is with Guru. Simultaneously Vyaya Lord should be in 
Lagn.  
28. FEAR FROM DOGS. There will be fear from dogs during the 10th and 
19th year, if the Lagna Lord and the 6th Lord are in exchange. 
Ch. 18. Effects of Yuvati Bhava 
1. O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me, detailing the effects of the 7th 
Bhava. If Yuvati Lord is in his own Rāśi, or in exaltation, one will derive full 
happiness through his wife (and marriage).  
2. SICK WIFE. Should Yuvati Lord be in Ari, 8th, or Vyaya, the wife will be 
sickly. This however does not apply to own Bhava, or exaltation placement, 
as above. 
3. Excessive·Libidinousness/Death·of·Wife. If Śukr is in Yuvati, the native 
will be exceedingly libidinous. If Śukr yuti a malefic in any Bhava, it will 
cause loss of wife. 
4-5. THE 7TH LORD. Should Yuvati Lord be endowed with strength and be 
yuti with, or be drishtied by a benefic, the native will be wealthy, 
honourable, happy and fortunate. Conversely, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, or is 
combust, or is in an enemy‟s Rāśi, one will acquire sick wives and many 
wives. 
6. PLURALITY OF WIVES. If Yuvati Lord is in a Rāśi of Śani, or of Śukr 
and be drishtied by a benefic, there will be many wives. Should Yuvati Lord 
be particularly in exaltation, the same effects will come to pass. 7-8½. MlSCELLANEOUS MATTERS. The native will befriend barren 
females, if Sūrya is in Yuvati. Candr therein will cause association with 
such female, as corresponding to the Rāśi, becoming Yuvati. Mangal, 
placed in Yuvati, will denote association with marriageable girls (those with 
menses), or with barren females. Budh indicates harlots, mean females 
and females, belonging to traders‟ community. Wife of a Brahmin, or a 
pregnant female will be in the native‟s association, if Guru is in Yuvati. 
Base females and females, having attained their courses, are denoted by 
Śani, Rahu/Ketu in Yuvati. 
8-9½. Mangal denotes a female with attractive breasts. Śani indicates sick 
and weak spouse. Guru will bring a spouse with hard and prominent 
breasts. Śukr will bring one with bulky and excellent breasts. 
10-13½. Malefics in Vyaya and 7th, while decreasing Candr is in Putr 
denote, that the native will be controlled by spouse, who will be inimical to 
the race (or family). If Yuvati Bhava is occupied, or owned by Śani/Mangal, 
the native will beget a harlot, as his spouse, or he will be attached to other 
illegally. Should Śukr be in a Navamsa of Mangal, or in a Rasi of Mangal, 
or receive a Drishti from, or be yuti with Mangal, the native will “kiss” the 
private parts of the female. If Śukr is so related to Śani, the native will “kiss” 
the private parts of the male. 
14-15. WORTHY SPOUSE. The native will beget a spouse endowed with 
(the seven principal) virtues, who will expand his dynasty by sons and 
grandsons, if the 7th Lord is exalted, while Yuvati is occupied by strong 
Lagna Lord and a benefic. 
16. EVILS TO SPOUSE. If Yuvati Bhava, or its Lord is yuti with a malefic 
the native‟s wife will incur evils, especially, if Yuvati Bhava, or its Lord is 
bereft of strength. 
17. LOSS OF SPOUSE. If Yuvati Lord is devoid of strength and is 
relegated to Ari, 8th, or Vyaya, or, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, the native‟s wife 
will be destroyed (i.e. she will die early). 
18. LACK OF CONJUGAL FELICITY. If Candr is in Yuvati, as Yuvati Lord 
is in Vyaya and the Karaka (indicator Śukr) is bereft of strength, the native 
will not be endowed with marital happiness. 19-21. PLURALlIY OF WIVES. One will have two wives, if Yuvati Lord is in 
fall, or in a malefic Rāśi along with a malefic, while Yuvati Bhava, or the 7th 
Navamsa belong to a eunuch planet. If Mangal and Śukr are in Yuvati, or, if 
Śani is Yuvati, while the Lord of Lagn is in Randhr, the native will have 3 
wives. There will be many wives, if Śukr is in a Dual Rāśi, while its Lord is 
in exaltation, as Yuvati Lord is endowed with strength. 
22. TIME OF MARRIAGE (upto Sloka 34). If Yuvati Lord is in a benefic‟s 
Bhava (or in Dharm, as Subha Rāśi so means), while Śukr is exalted, or is 
in own Rāśi, the native will marry at the age of 5, or 9. 
23. If Sūrya is in Yuvati, while his dispositor is yuti with Śukr, there will be 
marriage at 7th, or 11th year of age. 
24. Śukr in Dhan, while Yuvati Lord is in Labh will give marriage at the age 
of 10, or 16. 
25. Marriage will take place during the 11th year, if Śukr is in an angle from 
Lagn, while Lagn Lord is in Makar, or Kumbh. 
26. The native will marry at 12, or l9, if Śukr is in an angle from the Lagna, 
while Śani is in Yuvati counted from Śukr. 
27. Should Śukr be in Yuvati from Candr, while Śani is in Yuvati from Śukr, 
marriage will be in the 18th year. 
28. Marriage will be in the 15th year, if Dhan Lord is in Labh, while Lagn 
Lord is in Karm. 
29. An exchange between the Lords of Dhan and Labh will bring marriage 
13 years after birth. 
30. Ones 22nd/27th year will confer marriage, if Śukr is in Yuvati from the 8th 
Bhava (i.e. Dhan from Lagna), while his dispositor is yuti with Mangal. 
31. Should Yuvati Lord be in Vyaya, while the natal Lord is in Yuvati in 
Navamsa, marriage will be in 23rd/26th year of age. 
32. Either the 25th year, or the 33rd year will bring marriage, if Randhr Lord 
is in Yuvati, as Śukr is in Navamsa Lagna. 33. Should Śukr be in Dharm from Dharm (i.e. in Putr Bhava), while Rahu 
is in one of the said Bhavas (i.e. in Putr/Dharm), marriage will take place 
during 31st, or 33rd year. 
34. The native will marry at 30, or 27, if Śukr is in Lagn, while the 7th Lord is 
in Yuvati itself. 
35-39. TIMING OF WIFE‟S DEATH. Loss of wife will occur in the 18th year, 
or 33rd year of age of the native, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, while Śukr is in 
Randhr. One will lose his spouse in his 19th year, if Yuvati Lord is in the 8th, 
while Vyaya Lord is in Yuvati. The native‟s wife will die within three days of 
marriage due to snake bite, if the native has Rahu in Dhan and Mangal in 
Yuvati. If Śukr is in Randhr, while his dispositor is in a Rāśi of Śani, death 
of wife will take place during the native‟s 12th, or 21st year of age. Should 
the ascendat Lord be in his Rāśi of debilitation, as Dhan Lord is in Randhr, 
loss of wife will occur in the 13th year of age. 
40-41. THREE MARRIAGES. Should Candr be in Yuvati from Śukr, while 
Budh is in Yuvati from Candr and Randhr Lord is in Putr (from the Lagna), 
there will be marriage in Karm year followed by another in the 22nd year 
and yet another in the 33rd year. 
42. DEATH OF WlFE. lf Ari, 7th and 8th are in their order occupied by 
Mangal, Rahu and Śani, the native‟s wife will not live (long). 
Ch. 19. Effects of Randhr Bhava 
1. Long Life. O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me speak on the effects 
of Randhr Bhava. If Randhr‟s Lord is in an angle, long life is indicated. 
2. Short Life. Should Randhr‟s Lord join Lagn‟s Lord, or a malefic and be in 
Randhr itself, the native will be short lived. 
3. Śani and Karm‟s Lord about Longevity. Similarly consider Śani and 
Karm‟s Lord in the matter of longevity. Karm‟s Lord is in Randhr along with 
a malefic Grah and/or Lagn‟s Lord. 
4-7. Long Life. There will be long life, if Ari‟s Lord is in Vyaya, or, if Ari‟s 
Lord is in Ari, as Vyaya‟s Lord is in Vyaya, or, if Ari‟s Lord and Vyaya‟s Lord 
are in Lagn and Randhr. If the Lords of Putr, Randhr and Tanu Bhava are 
in own Navāńśas, own Rāśis, or in friendly Rāśis, the native will enjoy a long span of life. Should the Lords of Lagn, Randhr and Karm Bhava and 
Śani are all disposed severally in an angle, in a trine, or in Labh Bhava, the 
subject will live long. Like these, there are many other Yogas, dealing with 
the issue of longevity. The strength and weakness of the Grahas 
concerned be estimated in deciding longevity. 
8-13. Short Life. One‟s span of life will be between 20 and 32 years, if 
Lagn‟s Lord is weak, while Randhr‟s Lord is an angle. The native will only 
be short-lived, if Randhr‟s Lord is in fall, while Randhr Bhava has a malefic 
in it and Tanu Bhava is bereft of strength. Death will be instant at birth, if 
Randhr Bhava, Randhr‟s Lord and Vyaya Bhava are all conjunct malefics. 
Malefics in angles and/or trines and benefics in Ari and/or Randhr Bhava, 
while Tanu Bhava has in it Randhr‟s Lord in fall: this Yoga will cause 
immediate end. If Putr and Randhr Bhava and Randhr‟s Lord are all 
conjunct malefics, the life span will be very brief. Within a month of birth, 
death will befall the child, if Randhr‟s Lord is in Randhr itself, while Candr is 
with malefics and be bereft of beneficial Drishti. 
14-15. Long Life (again). One will be long-lived, if Lagn‟s Lord is in 
exaltation, while Candr and Guru are, respectively, in Labh and Randhr 
Bhava. If Lagn‟s Lord is exceedingly strong and receives a Drishti from a 
benefic, which is placed in an angle, the person concerned will be wealthy, 
virtuous and long-lived. 
Ch. 20. Effects of Dharm Bhava 
(1) Combinations for Fortunes. O Brahmin, now listen to the effects of 
Dharm Bhava. One will be fortunate (or affluent), if Dharm‟s Lord is in 
Dharm Bhava with strength. 
(2) Should Guru be in Dharm Bhava, while Dharm‟s Lord is in an angle and 
Lagn‟s Lord is endowed with strength, one will be extremely fortunate. 
3. Fortunate (Affluent) Father. If Dharm‟s Lord is with strength, as Śukr is in 
Dharm, while Guru is in an angle from Tanu Bhava, the native‟s father is 
fortunate. 
4. Indigent Father. If Dharm‟s Lord is debilitated, while the 2nd and/or the 4th 
from Dharm Bhava is occupied by Mangal, the native‟s father is poor. 5. Long-living Father. Should Dharm‟s Lord be in deep exaltation, while 
Śukr is in an angle from Tanu Bhava and Guru is in the 9th from Navāńś 
Lagn, the father of the native will enjoy a long span of life. 
6. Royal Status for Father. If Dharm‟s Lord is an angle and receives a 
Drishti from Guru, the native‟s father will be a king endowed with 
conveyances, or be equal to a king. 
7. Wealthy and Famous Father. Should Dharm‟s Lord be in Karm Bhava, 
while Karm‟s Lord receives a Drishti from a benefic the native‟s father will 
be very rich and famous. 
8-9. Virtuous and Devoted to Father. Should Sūrya be in deep exaltation, 
as Dharm‟s Lord is in Labh Bhava, the native will be virtuous, dear to the 
king and devoted to father. If Sūrya is in a trine from Lagna, while Dharm‟s 
Lord is in Yuvati in yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from Guru, the native will 
be devoted to his father. 
10. Fortunes etc. Acquisition of fortunes, conveyances and fame will follow 
the 32nd year of age, if Dharm‟s Lord is in Dhan, while Dhan‟s Lord is in 
Dharm. 
11. Inimical to Father. There will be mutual enmity between the father and 
the native, if Lagn‟s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, but with the Lord of Ari. 
Further, the native‟s father will be of contemptible disposition. 
12. Begged Food. If Karm‟s Lord and Sahaj‟s Lord are bereft of strength, 
while Dharm‟s Lord is in fall, or combust the native will go begging for his 
food. 
13-25. Combinations for Father‟s Death. The father of the native would 
have passed away prior to the native‟s birth, if Sūrya is in Ari, Randhr, or 
Vyaya Bhava, as Randhr‟s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, Vyaya‟s Lord is in 
Tanu Bhava and Ari‟s Lord is in Putr Bhava. Should Sūrya be in Randhr 
Bhava, while Randhr‟s Lord is in Dharm, the native‟s father will pass away 
within a year of his birth. If the Lord of Vyaya Bhava is in Dharm Bhava, 
while Dharm‟s Lord is in its debilitation Navāńś, the native‟s father will face 
his end during the 3rd, or the 16th year of the native. Death of father will 
occur in the 2nd, or the 12th year, if Lagn‟s Lord is in Randhr Bhava, as 
Randhr‟s Lord is with Sūrya. Should Rahu be in the 8th from Dharm, as 
Sūrya is in the 9th from Dharm, death of father will take place in the 16th, or the 18th year of the native. If Śani is in the 9th from Candr, as Sūrya is with 
Rahu, the native‟s father will die in the 7th, or the 19th year of the native. 
The native in his 44th year will lose his father, if Dharm‟s Lord is in Vyaya, 
as Vyaya‟s Lord is in Dharm. If Lagn‟s Lord is in Randhr Bhava, as Candr is 
in Sūrya‟s Navāńś, the native in his 35th, or 41st year will lose his father. 
One will lose his father in the 50th year, if Sūrya, being the Lord of Dharm, 
is conjunct Mangal and Śani. If Sūrya is in the 7th from Dharm Bhava, as 
Rahu is in the 7th from Sahaj Bhava, the 6th, or 25th year of the native will be 
fatal for father. If Śani is in the 7th from Randhr Bhava, as Sūrya is in the 7th 
from Śani, the ages of 21, 26, or 30 will be fatal for the father. If Dharm‟s 
Lord is in its debilitation Rāśi, while his dispositor is in Dharm Bhava, the 
native will lose his father at the age of 26, or 30. Thus the Jyotishis may 
know the effects. 
26. Fortunes. One will enjoy abundant fortunes, if Śukr is in deep exaltation 
and be in the company of Dharm‟s Lord, as Śani is in Sahaj. 
27-28. Fortunate Periods. Abundant fortunes be acquired after the 20th 
year, if Dharm has Guru in it, as its Lord is in an angle from Lagn. Should 
Budh be in his deep exaltation, as Dharm‟s Lord is in Dharm itself, 
abundant fortunes will be earned after th e 36th year. 
29. Should Lagn‟s Lord be in Dharm, as Dharm‟s Lord is in Lagn and Guru 
is in Yuvati, there will be gains of wealth and conveyances. 
30. Lack of Fortunes. If Rahu is in the 9th from Dharm Bhava, as his 
dispositor is in Randhr Bhava and Dharm‟s Lord is in fall, the native be 
devoid of fortunes. 
31. Food by Begging. Should Śani be in Dharm Bhava along with Candr, as 
Lagn‟s Lord is in fall, the native will acquire food by begging. 
32. O Brahmin, these are the effects related to Dharm Bhava. I have 
explained briefly. These may be estimated with the help of the state of the 
Lords of Lagn and Dharm Bhava and in other manners as well. 
Ch. 21. Effects of Karm Bhava 
1. I now explain the effects of Karm Bhava. Listen to these, o Maitreya, in 
the words of Brahma, Garga and others. 2. Paternal Happiness. If Karm‟s Lord is strong and in exaltation, or in its 
own Rāśi/Navāńś, the native will derive extreme paternal happiness, will 
enjoy fame and will perform good deeds. 
3. If Karm‟s Lord is devoid of strength, the native will face obstructions in 
his work. If Rahu is in an angle, or in a trine, he will perform religious 
sacrifices, like Jyotishtoma. 
4. If Karm‟s Lord is with a benefic, or be in an auspicious Bhava, one will 
always gain through royal patronage and in business. In a contrary 
situation, only opposite results will come to pass. 
5. Should Karm and Labh Bhava be both occupied by malefics, the native 
will indulge only in bad deeds and will defile his own men. 
6. If the Lord of Karm Bhava is relegated to Randhr Bhava along with 
Rahu, the native will hate others; be a great fool and will do bad deeds. 
7. If Śani, Mangal and Karm‟s Lord are in Yuvati, as Yuvati‟s Lord is with a 
malefic, the native will be fond of carnal pleasures and of filling his belly. 
8-10 Should Karm‟s Lord be in exaltation and be in the company of Guru, 
as Dharm‟s Lord is in Karm the native will be endowed with honour, wealth 
and valour. One will lead a happy life, if Labh‟s Lord is in Karm and Karm‟s 
Lord is in Lagn, or, if the Lord of Karm Bhava is yuti with the Lord of Labh 
Bhava in an angle. Should Karm‟s Lord in strength be in Meen along Guru, 
the native will doubtless obtain robes, ornaments and happiness. 
11. Should Rahu, Sūrya, Śani and Mangal be in Labh Bhava, the native will 
incur cessation of his duties. 
12. One will be learned and wealthy, if Guru is in Meen along with Śukr, 
while Lagn‟s Lord is strong and Candr is in exaltation. 
13. Should Karm‟s Lord be in Labh, while Labh‟s Lord is in Tanu Bhava and 
Śukr is in Karm, the native will be endowed with precious stones. 
14. If the Karm‟s Lord is exalted in an angle, or a trine and is yuti with Guru, 
or receives a Drishti from Guru, one will be endowed with deeds. 15. Should Karm‟s Lord be in Lagn along with Lagn‟s Lord, as Candr is in 
an angle, or in a trine, the native will be interested in good deeds. 
16. If Śani is in Karm Bhava along with a debilitated Grah, while Karm 
Bhava in the Navāńś Kundali is occupied by a malefic, the native will be 
bereft of acts. 
17. One will indulge in bad acts, if Karm‟s Lord is in Randhr Bhava, while 
Randhr‟s Lord is in Karm Bhava with a malefic. 
18. Obstructions to the native‟s acts will crop up, if Karm‟s Lord is in fall, as 
both Karm Bhava and the 10th from Karm Bhava have malefic occupations. 
19-21. Combinations for Fame. One will be endowed with fame, if Candr is 
in Karm Bhava, while Karm‟s Lord is in a trine from Karm Bhava and Lagn‟s 
Lord is in Lagn‟s angle. Similar effects will come to pass, if Labh‟s Lord is in 
Karm Bhava, while Karm‟s Lord is strong and gives a Drishti to Guru. Fame 
will come to the native, if Karm‟s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, as Lagn‟s Lord is 
in Karm Bhava and Candr is in Putr Bhava. 
22. O excellent of the Brahmins, thus have been told about the effects of 
Karm Bhava in a brief manner. Other related effects be guessed by you 
based on the relationship of the Lords of Lagn and of Karm Bhava. 
Ch. 22. Effects of Labh Bhava 
1. O excellent of the Brahmins, I now explain effects relating to Labh 
Bhava, the auspiciousness of which Bhava will make one happy at all 
times. 
2. Should Labh‟s Lord be in Labh itself, or be in an angle, or in a trine from 
Lagn, there will be many gains. Similarly, if Labh‟s Lord is exalted, though 
in combustion there will be many gains. 
3. If Labh‟s Lord is in Dhan Bhava, while Dhan‟s Lord is in an angle along 
with Guru, the gains will be great. 
4. If Labh‟s Lord is in Sahaj Bhava, while Labh Bhava is occupied by a 
benefic, the native will gain 2000 Nishkas in his 36th year. 5. If Labh‟s Lord is yuti with a benefic in an angle, or in a trine, the native 
will acquire 500 Nishkas in his 40th year. 
6. The native will own 6000 Nishkas, if Labh Bhava is occupied by Guru, 
while Dhan Bhava and Dharm Bhava are, respectively, taken over by 
Candr and Śukr by position. 
7. Should Guru, Budh and Candr be in the 11th from Labh, the native will be 
endowed with wealth, grains, fortunes, diamonds, ornaments etc. 
8. One will gain 1000 Nishkas in his 33rd year, if Labh‟s Lord is in Lagn and 
Lagn‟s Lord is in Labh Bhava. 
9. If Labh‟s Lord is in Dhan Bhava, as Dhan‟s Lord is in Labh Bhava, one 
will amass abundant fortunes after marriage. 
10. If Labh‟s Lord is in Sahaj Bhava, as Sahaj‟s Lord is in Labh Bhava, one 
will gain wealth through co-borns and will be endowed with excellent 
ornaments. 
11. There will be no gains in spite of numerous efforts, if Labh‟s Lord is in 
fall, in combustion, or be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava with a malefic. 
Ch. 23. Effects of Vyaya Bhava 
1-4. O Brahmin, now I tell you about the effects of Vyaya Bhava. There will 
be expenses on good accounts, if Vyaya‟s Lord is with a benefic, or in his 
own Bhava, or exalted, or, if a benefic occupies Vyaya. One will own 
beautiful houses and beds and be endowed with superior scented articles 
and pleasures, if Candr happens to be Vyaya‟s Lord and be exalted, or be 
in its own Rāśi and/or Navāńś, or in Labh/Dharm/Putr Bhava in 
Rāśi/Navāńś. The said native will live with rich clothes and ornaments, be 
learned and Lordly.  
5-6. And, if Vyaya‟s Lord is in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, or be in enemy‟s 
Navāńś, in debilitation Navāńś, or in Randhr Bhava in Navāńś, one will be 
devoid of happiness from wife, be troubled by expenses and deprived of 
general happiness. If he be in an angle, or trine, the native will beget a 
spouse. 7. Just as these effects are derived from Tanu Bhava in regard to the 
native, similar deductions be made about co-borns etc. from Sahaj and 
other Bhavas. 
8. Grahas placed in the visible half of the zodiac will give explicit results, 
while the ones in the invisible half will confer secret results. 
9. If Rahu is in Vyaya along with Mangal, Śani and Sūrya, the native will go 
to hell. Similar effect will occur, if Vyaya‟s Lord is with Sūrya. 
10. If there is a benefic in Vyaya, while its Lord is exalted, or is yuti with, or 
receives a Drishti from a benefic, one will attain final emancipation. 
11. One will wander from country to country, if Vyaya‟s Lord and Vyaya 
Bhava are with malefics and Vyaya‟s Lord gives a Drishti to, or receives a 
Drishti from malefics. 
12. One will move in his own country, if Vyaya‟s Lord and Vyaya Bhava are 
with benefics and Vyaya‟s Lord gives a Drishti to, or receives a Drishti from 
benefics. 
13. Earnings will be through sinful measures, if Vyaya is occupied by Śani, 
or Mangal etc. and is not receiving a Drishti from a benefic. 
14. If Lagn‟s Lord is in Vyaya, while Vyaya‟s Lord is in Lagn with Śukr, 
expenses will be on religious grounds.

will be nullified, while results of varied nature will come to pass. The Grah

86-87. O Brahmin, these are the effects for Dhum etc. Before declaring 
these results, the effects of Sūrya and other Grahas should be wisely 
conceived by their positions, relations and Drishtis apart from their strength, 
or weakness. 
Ch. 26. Evaluation of Drishtis of Grahas 
1. O Glorious, it is said, that Drishtis (of Grahas) and their strengths are to 
be known in deciding the effects. How many kinds are these? Please clarify 
doubts. 2-5. Drishtis of the Grahas. O Brahmin, I have earlier stated Drishtis, based 
on Rāśis. The other kind is between Grahas, which I detail below. 3rd and 
10th, 5th and 9th, 4th and 8th and lastly 7th. On these places the Drishtis 
increase gradually in slabs of quarters, i.e ¼, ½, ¾ and full. The effects will 
also be proportionate. All Grahas give a Drishti to the 7th fully. Śani, Guru 
and Mangal have special Drishtis, respectively, on the 3rd and the 10th, the 
5th and the 9th and the 4th and the 8th. The ancient preceptors have 
explained these, which ordinary. By subtle mathematical calculations these 
Drishtis will have to be clearly understood, as under. 
6-8. Evaluation of the Drishtis of the Grahas. Deduct the longitude of the 
Grah (or Bhava), that receives a Drishti, from that of the Grah, which gives 
the Drishti. If the sum exceeds six Rāśis, deduct the sum again from 10 
Rāśis. Convert the latter sum into degrees and divide by two. The resultant 
product is Drishti Kona (or aspectual angle). If the difference is in excess of 
5 Rāśis, ignore the Rāśis and multiply the degrees etc. by 2, which is the 
value of the Drishti. If the difference is in excess of 4 Rāśis, deduct it from 5 
Rāśis, and the resultant degees etc. become the Drishti value. If the 
difference is in excess of 3 Rāśis, deduct it from 4 Rāśis and (increase 30 
by) halve the product to get the Drishti value. If the difference is above 2 
Rāśis, ignore the Rāśis and add 15 to the degrees etc. to get the Drishti 
value. If it is in excess of one Rāśi, ignore the Rāśis and divide the degrees 
by 2 to get the Drishti value. 
9-10. Special consideration for Śani‟s Drishtis. O Brahmin, if Śani is the 
Grah, that gives a Drishti, find out the difference between him and the 
Grah, that receives the Drishti; if the sum is above 1 Rāśi, multiply the 
degrees etc. by 2 to get the Drishti value. If the sum is above nine Rāśis, 
the degrees to elapse be doubled to get the Drishti value. If the sum is 
above 2 Rāśis, the degrees etc. be halved and deducted from 60. If the 
sum exceeds 8 Rāśis, add to the degrees etc. a figure of 30 to get the 
Drishti value. In other cases, the sums be processed, as explained earlier. 
11. Special consideration for Mangal‟s Drishtis. Deduct the longitude of 
Mangal from that of the Grah, that receives the Drishti. If the sum is 3 Rāśis 
& c, or 7 Rāśis & c, the degrees etc. be reduced from 60. If it is above 2 
Rāśis, the degrees etc. be increased by half of it and superadd 15. If the 
sum is 6 Rāśis, one Rup is the value. 12. Special consideration for Guru‟s Drishtis. Deduct the longitude of Guru 
from that of the Grah, that receives the Drishti from Guru. If the resultant 
sum is 3 Rāśis & c, or 7 Rāśis & c, halve the degrees etc. and increase it 
by 15. It the sum is 4 Rāśis & c, or 8 Rāśis & c, the degrees etc. be 
subtracted from 60. This will be the Drishti value. The sum, being in 
conformity with others than these, be treated, as stated earlier.

strengths are computed for the seven Grahas from Sūrya to Śani. The 
nodes are not considered. 
Sthan Bal comprises of the following considerations: Uchch Bal 
(exaltation), Sapt Vargaj Bal (strength accruing out of positions in Rāśi, 
Hora, Dreshkan, Saptāńś, Navāńś, Dvadashāńś and Trimshāńś), 
OjhayugmaRāśiāńś Bal (acquired by placement in odd, or even Rāśi and in 
odd, or even Navāńś), Kendradi Bal (due to placement in Kon, or 
Panaphara, or Apoklima Bhava), Dreshkan Bal (due to placement in first, 
second, or third decanate of a Rāśi). 
Kaal Bal comprises of the following subdivisions: Nathonnata Bal (diurnal 
and nocturnal), Paksh Bal (fortnight), Tribhag Bal (due to day/night being 
made in 3 parts), Varsh, Maas, Dina and Hora Bal (Varsh - astrological 
year, Maas - month, Dina - weekday and Hora - planetary hour), Ayan Bal 
(equinoctial), Yudhdh Bal (due to partaking in war between Grahas). 
1-1½. Sthan Bal (up to Sloka 6). Firstly Uchch Bal. Now about the strengths 
by classes positional, temporal etc. Deduct from the longitude of the Grah 
its (deep) debilitation point. If the sum is less than 6 Rāśis, consider it, as it 
is; if it exceeds 6 Rāśis, deduct the same from 12 Rāśis. The sum so got be 
converted into degrees etc. and divided by 3, which is the Grah‟s Uchch 
Bal in Virupas. 
2-4. Sapt Vargaj Bal. If a Grah is in its Mooltrikon Rāśi, it gets 45 Virupas, 
in Svasth Rāśi 30 Virupas, in Pramudit Rāśi 20 Virupas, in Shant Rāśi 15 
Virupas, in Din Rāśi 10 Virupas, in Duhkhit Rāśi 4 Virupas and in Khal Rāśi 
2 Virupas. Similarly these values occur for the other 6 divisional occupations, viz. Hora, Dreshkan, Saptāńś, Navāńś, Dvadashāńś and 
Trimshāńś. When all these are added together the Grah‟s Sapt Vargaj Bal 
emerges. 
4½. OjhayugmaRāśiāńś Bal. Each of Śukr and Candr in even Rāśis and 
others in odd Rāśis acquire a quarter of Rupa. These are applicable to 
such Navāńśas also. 
5. Kendradi Bal. A Grah in a Kon gets full strength, while one in Panaphara 
Bhava gets half and the one in Apoklima Bhava gets a quarter, as Kendradi 
Bal. 
6. Dreshkan Bal. Male, female and hermaphrodite Grahas, respectively, get 
a quarter Rupa according to placements in the first, second and third 
decanates. 
7-7½. Dig Bal. Deduct Bandhu Bhava (Nadir) from the longitudes of Sūrya 
and Mangal, Yuvati Bhava from that of Guru and Budh, Karm Bhava from 
that of Śukr and Candr and lastly Lagn from that of Śani. If the sum is 
above 180 degrees, deduct the sum from 360. The sum arrived in either 
way be divided by 3, which will be Dig Bal of the Grah. 
8-9. Kaal Bal (up to Sloka 17). Firstly Nathonnata Bal. Find out the 
difference between midnight and the apparent birth time, which is called 
Unnata. Deduct Unnata from 30 Ghatis to obtain Nata. Double the Nata in 
Ghatis, which will indicate identical Nata Bal for Candr, Mangal and Śani. 
Deduct the Nata from 60 to know the Unnata Bal of Sūrya, Guru and Śukr. 
Budh, irrespective of day and night, gets full Nathonnata Bal. 
10-11. Paksh Bal. Deduct from Candr‟s longitude that of Sūrya. If the sum 
exceeds 6 Rāśis, deduct the same from 12. The product so obtained be 
converted into degrees etc. and divided by 3, which will indicate the Paksh 
Bal of each of the benefic Grahas. The Paksh Bal of benefic should be 
deducted from 60, which will go to each malefic, as Paksh Bal. 
12. Tribagh Bal. One Rupa is obtained by Budh in the first 1/3 part of day 
time, by Sūrya in the second 1/3 part of the day and by Śani in the last 1/3 
part of the day. Similarly Candr, Śukr and Mangal get full Bal in the first, 
second and last 1/3 parts of the night. Guru gets this Bal at all times. 13. Varsh-Maas-Dina-Hora Bal. 15, 30, 45 and 60 Virupas are in order 
given to Varsh Lord, Maas Lord, Dina Lord and Hora Lord. Naisargika Bal 
has already been explained. 
The Varsh Lord is the Lord of the day, on which the astrological year of 
birth starts. To calculate this we first need the number of days, past from 
the beginning of Creation, the Ahargan. According to late Rev. Ebenezer 
Burgess, who translated Sūrya Siddhanta in English, as on January 1, 
1860, the number of days, past from the beginning of Creation are 
714,404,108,573. Divide the number of days, past from the day of Creation 
till the day of birth, by 60. Reject remainder and multiply the quotient by 3. 
Increase the post-multiplied product by 1 and divide by 7. The remainder 
will indicate the week day, on which the astrological year, giving birth to the 
native, opened. Remainder 1 indicates Sunday, 2 Monday and so on. 
Maas Lord. Divide the same Ahargan by 30 and the quotient indicates 
months, passed from Creation to birth. The completed months be multiplied 
by 2 and increased by 1. The latter sum should be divided by 7 and the 
remainder indicates, on which day the birth month began. Continuing with 
the same case, we divide 65295 by 30. Quotient is 2176. This sum 
multiplied by 2 and increased by 1 denotes 4353. Dividing 4353 by 7, we 
get a remainder of 6, denoting Friday. That is, the month of birth began on 
Friday and the Maas Bal goes to Śukr, the Lord of Friday. 
Dina Lord. Though the week day of birth can be known from ephemeris, or 
perpetual calendars, we better adopt the method prescribed, which will 
confirm, if the Ahargan followed is correct. The number of days, as arrived 
above, indicating Ahargan, be divided by 7 and the remainder will indicate 
the week day of birth. 
Hora Bal. Hora means planetary hour. Each day from sunrise to sunrise is 
divided into 24 equal parts of one hour. These Horas are ruled by the 7 
Grahas from Sūrya to Śani. The first Hora of the day is ruled by the Lord of 
the week day. The 2nd one is ruled by the Lord of the 6th week day, counted 
from the first ruler. The 3rd Hora is ruled by the Lord of the 6th week day, 
counted from the 2nd Hora Lord. Similarly it proceeds in the same manner, 
till the first Hora of the next day is taken over by the Lord of that day 
himself. Whichever Grah rules the birth Hora, gets the Hora Bal. Horas are 
to be calculated for mean local time and not standard time of births. 14. Naisargika Bal. Divide one Rupa by 7 and multiply the resultant product 
by 1 to 7 separately, which will indicate the Naisargika Bal, due to Śani, 
Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr, Candr and Sūrya, respectively. 
15-17. Ayan Bal. 45, 33 and 12 are the Khandas for calculating Ayan Bal. 
Add Ayanāńś to the Grah and find out the Bhuja (distance from the nearest 
equinox). Add the figure, corresponding to the Rāśi (of the Bhuja) to the 
Bhuja. The degrees etc. of the Bhuja should be multiplied by the figure, 
corresponding to the highest of the left out Khandas and divided by 30. Add 
the resultant product to the sum, obtained earlier. Convert this to Rāśi, 
degrees, minutes and seconds. If Candr and Śani are in Tula, or ahead, 
add to this 3 Rāśis and, if in Mesh to Kanya, reduce from this 3 Rāśis. 
Similarly it is reverse for Sūrya, Mangal, Śukr and Guru. For Budh 3 Rāśis 
are always additive. The resultant sum in Rāśi, degrees and minutes be 
divided by 3 to get the Ayan Bal in Rupas. 
Notes. Ayan Bal can be found out on the following simple formula: Ayan 
Bal = 60*(23°27‟ + Kranti)/(46°54‟) = (23°27‟± Kranti)*1.2793. 
The following points have to be remembered in respect of Krantis. When 
Candr, or Śani have southern Kranti, or, when Sūrya, Mangal, Guru, or 
Śukr have northern Kranti, take plus. In a contrary situation in respect of 
these 6 Grahas, take minus. As far as Budh is concerned, it is always plus. 
Krantis (or declinations) can be ascertained from a standard modern 
ephemeris. 
Sūrya‟s Ayan Bal is again multiplied by 2 whereas for others the product 
arrived in Virupas is considered, as it is. 
18. Motional Strength for Sūrya and Candr. Sūrya‟s Chesht Bal will 
correspond to his Ayan Bal. Candr‟s Paksh Bal will itself be her Chesht Bal. 
19. Drik Bal. Reduce one fourth of the Drishti Pinda, if a Grah receives 
malefic Drishtis and add a fourth, if it receives a Drishti from a benefic. 
Super add the entire Drishti of Budh and Guru to get the net strength of a 
Grah.  
20. War Between Grahas. Should there be a war between the starry 
Grahas, the difference between the Shad Balas of the two should be added 
to the victor‟s Shad Bal and deducted from the Shad Bal of the vanquished. 21-23. Motions of Grahas (Mangal to Śani). Eight kinds of motions are 
attributed to Grahas. These are Vakr (retrogression), Anuvakr (entering the 
previous Rāśi in retrograde motion), Vikal (devoid of motion), Mand 
(somewhat slower motion than usual), Mandatar (slower than the previous), 
Sama (somewhat increasing in motion), Char (faster than Sama) and 
Atichar (entering next Rāśi in accelerated motion). The strengths, allotted 
due to such 8 motions are 60, 30, 15, 30, 15, 7.5, 45 and 30. 
24-25. Motional Strength for Mangal etc. Add together the mean and true 
longitudes of a Grah and divide the one by two. Reduce this sum from the 
Seeghroch (or apogee) of the Grah. The resultant product will indicate the 
Chesht Kendra (or Seeghr Kendra) of the Grah from 12 Rāśis. The Rāśi, 
degrees and minutes so arrived should be converted into degrees, minutes 
etc. and divided by 3, which will denote the motional strength of the Grah. 
Thus there are six sources of strength, called Sthan Bal, Dig Bal, Kaal Bal, 
Drik Bal, Chesht Bal and Naisargika Bal. 
26-29. Bhava Balas. Thus I explained about the strengths of the Grahas. 
Deduct Yuvati Bhava from the Bhava, if the Bhava happens to be in Kanya, 
Mithun, Tula, Kumbh, or the first half of Dhanu. If Mesh, Vrishabh, Simh, or 
first half of Makar, or the second half of Dhanu happen to be the Bhava, 
deduct Bandhu Bhava from it. Should the Bhava be in Kark, or in Vrischik, 
deduct from it Lagn. Deduct Karm Bhava from the Bhava, happening to fall 
in Makar second half, or Meen. Convert the product so obtained into 
degrees etc. and divide by 3 to get Bhava Bal. If the balance in the process 
of deducting Nadir, Meridian, Lagn, or Yuvati exceeds 6 Rāśis, deduct it 
again from 12 Rāśis, before converting into degrees and dividing by 3. The 
product after division should be increased by one fourth, if the Bhava in 
question receives a benefic Drishti. If the Bhava receives a malefic Drishti, 
one fourth should be reduced. If Guru, or Budh give a Drishti to a Bhava, 
add that Grah‟s Drik Bal also. And then superadd the strength, acquired by 
the Lord of that Bhava. This will be the net Bhava Bal. 
30-31. Special Rules. The Bhavas, occupied by Guru and Budh will each 
get an addition of 1 Rupa, while each of the Bhavas, occupied by Śani, 
Mangal and Sūrya, suffer 1 Rupa reduction. 15 Virupas will have to be 
added to the Bhavas, falling in Seershodaya Rāśis, if birth happens to be in 
day time, to the Bhavas, falling in Dual Rāśis, if birth happens to be in 
twilight and to the Bhavas, falling in Prishtodaya Rāśis, if birth be in night 
time. 32-33. Shad Bal Requirements. 390, 360, 300, 420, 390, 330 and 300 
Virupas are the Shad Bal Pindas, needed for Sūrya etc. to be considered 
strong. If the strength exceeds the above-mentioned values, the Grah is 
deemed to be very strong. If a Grah has the required Shad Bal, it will prove 
favourable to the native by virtue of its strength. However, Śani‟s extreme 
strength will give long life as well as miseries. 
34-36. Guru, Budh and Sūrya are strong, if each of their Sthan Bal, Dig Bal, 
Kaal Bal, Chesht Bal and Ayan Bal are, respectively, 165, 35, 50, 112 and 
30 Virupas. The same required for Candr and Śukr are 133, 50, 30, 100 
and 40. For Mangal and Śani these are 96, 30, 40, 67 and 20. 
37-38. Bhava Effects. O Brahmin, thus the various sources of strengths be 
gathered together and effects declared. Whatever Yogas, or effects have 
been stated with respect to a Bhava, will come to pass through the 
strongest Grah. 
39-40. Eligibility of Issue Fruitful Predictions. O Maitreya, the words of one, 
who has achieved skill in mathematics, one, who has put in industrious 
efforts in the branch of grammar, one, who has knowledge of justice, one, 
who is intelligent, one, who has knowledge of geography, space and time, 
one, who has conquered his senses, one, who is skilfully logical (in 
estimation) and one, who is favourable to Jyotish, will doubtless be truthful. 
Ch. 28. Isht and Kasht Balas 
1. Now I narrate the benefic and malefic tendencies of the Grahas, based 
on which the Dasha effects can be decided. 
2. Exaltation Rays. Deduct the Grah‟s debilitation point from its actual 
position. If the sum exceeds 6 Rāśis, deduct from 12 Rāśis. The said sum 
should then be increased by 1 Rāśi. The degrees etc. be multiplied by 2, 
which, when considered along with Rāśis, will indicate the Uchch Rasmi of 
the Grah. 
3-4. Chesht Rasmi. Chesht Rasmis are to be calculated from Chesht Kendr 
similar to Uchch Rasmi computations. The Chesht Kendras of Grahas from 
Mangal to Śani have already been explained. Add 3 Rāśis to Sayan Sūrya 
(i.e. with Ayanāńś), which will be the Chesht Kendr for Sūrya. The sidereal 
longitude of Sūrya should be deducted from Candr to get Candr‟s Chesht Kendr. If the Chesht Kendr (for any Grah) is in excess of 6 Rāśis, deduct it 
from 12 Rāśis. Add 1 Rāśi and multiply the degrees etc. by 2, which will 
indicate the Chesht Rasmi of the Grah. 
5. Benefic and Malefic Rays. Add the Uchch Rasmis and Chesht Rasmis 
together and divide by two. The result will be auspicious rays (Subh 
Rasmis). Deduct from 8 the Subh Rasmis to obtain inauspicious rays 
(Asubh Rasmis). 
6. Isht and Kasht Tendencies. Reduce 1 from each of Chesht Rasmi and 
Uchch Rasmi. Then multiply the products by 10 and add together. Half of 
the sum will represent the Isht Phala (benefic tendency) of the Grah. 
Reduce Isht Phala from 60 to obtain the Grah‟s Kasht Phala (malefic 
tendency). 
7-9. Isht and Kasht and Sapt Varg Phal. 60, 45, 30, 22, 15, 8, 4, 2 and 0 
are the Subhankas (Subha Griha Pankthis, benefic points), due to a Grah‟s 
placement, respectively, in exaltation, Mooltrikon, own, great friend‟s, 
friend‟s, neutral, enemy‟s, great enemy‟s and debilitation Rāśi. If Subhanka 
is deducted from 60, Asubhanka (Asubh Pankthi, inauspicious points) will 
emerge. O Brahmin, in other Vargas these are halved. 
10. A Grah is considered auspicious in the first five of the said places. In 
the sixth place it is neutral, i.e. neither good nor bad. And in the other three 
places it is inauspicious. 
11-12. Nature of Effects, due to Dig Bal etc. The directional strength of a 
Grah is itself representative of the effects, due to the direction; and Kaal 
Bal itself is indicative of effects, due to the day. Whatever quantum of Dig 
Bal etc. are obtained by a Grah, will be the extent of auspicious effects, 
acquirable on account of that strength. Deducting those figures from 60, the 
extent of inauspiciousness is known. If auspiciousness is more in the case 
of a Grah‟s strength, the Dasha and Bhavas, related to that Grah will be 
auspicious. These are converse, if inauspiciousness is predominant. 
13-14. Sapt Varg Phal and Isht and Kasht (Continued). The various 
strengths (i.e. the other 6 Vargas) be multiplied by the respective Grah‟s 
Shad Bal Pinda, which will indicate the auspiciousness of the Varg 
concerned. Auspicious, or inauspicious aspect will be by multiplying the 
Subh, or Asubh Pankthi. Similarly auspicious, or inauspicious effects will be known by multiplying the auspicious, or inauspicious strength by the 
respective Pankthi. 
15-20. Effects of a Bhava. The strength of a Bhava and its Lord have 
already been explained. The actual effects will be a combination of Bhava 
strength and its Lord‟s strength. If there is a benefic in the Bhava add the 
same to the auspicious effects and deduct from inauspicious effects, which 
will denote the inauspicious effects. If a malefic is in the Bhava, reverse the 
process, i.e. add inauspicious effects and deduct auspicious effects. 
Similarly Drishtis and Balas. If a Grah is exalted, or with such a dignity, add 
auspicious effects and reduce inauspicious effects. For debilitation etc. it is 
converse. In Ashtak Varg add Bindus (auspicious points) and deduct 
Karanas (inauspicious points). If a Bhava extends to two Rāśis, the 
rectification will be done, as per both the Lords. In that case, whichever 
Rāśi has more Bindus, that Rāśi will yield more favourable results, 
concerning that Bhava. If both the Rāśis have more auspicious Bindus, 
take the average. Thus the auspicious and inauspicious effects of a Bhava 
be understood. 
Ch. 29. Bhava Padas 
1-3. Method of Bhava Calculation. O Brahmin, I shall now tell you about the 
Padas (Arudhas) for Bhavas and Grahas as well, as laid down by the 
earlier Maharishis. The Pad of Lagn will correspond to the Rāśi, arrived at 
by counting so many Rāśis from Lagn‟s Lord, as he is away from Tanu 
Bhava. Similarly Padas for other Bhavas be known through their Lords. The 
word “Pad” exclusively denotes the Pad for Lagn. 
Names of the 12 Arudhas are Lagn Pad - Arudh of Tanu Bhava, Dhan o f 
Dhan, Vikram (Bhratru) of Sahaj, Matru (Sukh) of Bandhu, Mantra (Putr) of 
Putr, Rog (Satru) of Ari, Dar (Kalatr) of Yuvati, Maran of Randhr, Pitru of 
Dharm Bhava, Karm of Karm, Labh of Labh, Vyaya of Vyaya. 
4-5. Special Exceptions. The same Bhava, or the 7th from it does not 
become its Pad. When the Pad falls in the same Bhava, the 10th therefrom 
be treated, as its Pad. Similarly, when the 7th becomes the Pad of a Bhava, 
the 4th from the original Bhava in question be treated, as its Pad. If the ruler 
of a Bhava be in the 4th from the Bhava, then the very Bhava occupied be 
noted, as the Pad. 6-7. Padas for Grahas. Note the position of a Grah and see how many 
Rāśis away is its own Rāśi with reference to its position. Count so many 
Rāśis from the said own Rāśi and the resultant Rāśi will become the Arudh 
of the Grah. If a Grah owns two Rāśis, or, if a Rāśi is owned by two 
Grahas; consider the stronger and declare effects accordingly. 
8-11. Pad and Finance (up to Sloka 15). O Brahmin, I now tell you of some 
effects of Grahas, based on Pad. If the 11th from Lagn Pad is occupied, or 
receives a Drishti from a Grah the native will be happy and rich; wealth will 
come through various means, if a benefic is related, as above. A malefic 
will confer wealth through questionable means. If there be both a benefic 
and a malefic, it will be through both means. If the Grah in question be in 
exaltation, or in own Rāśi etc., there will be plenty of gains and plenty of 
happiness.  
12. O excellent of the Brahmins, if the 12th from Lagn Pad does not receive 
a Drishti, as the 11th from Lagn Pad receives a Drishti from a Grah, then 
the gains will be uninterrupted. 
13-15. O Brahmin, the quantum of gains will correspond to the number of 
Grahas in, or giving a Drishti to the 11th from Lagn Pad. If there is Argala 
for the said 11th, there will be more gains, while a benefic Argala will bring 
still more gains. If the said benefic, causing Argala is in his exaltation Rāśi, 
the gains will be still higher. If the said 11th receives a Drishti from a benefic 
from Lagn, the 9th etc., gains will increase in the ascending order. In all 
these cases, the 12th from Pad should simultaneously be free from malefic 
association. A benefic, placed in Lagn, giving a Drishti to the 11th from 
Arudh Lagn will be still beneficial. If the Drishti is from the 9th from Lagn, it 
will confer much more gains. 
16-17. Pad and Financial Losses (up to Sloka 21). If the 12th from Lagn 
Pad receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with both benefics and malefics, there 
will be abundant earnings, but plenty of expenses. The benefic will cause 
through fair means, malefic through unfair means and mixed Grahas 
through both fair and unfair means. 
18. If the 12th from Lagn Pad is conjunct Sūrya, Śukr and Rahu, there wi ll 
be loss of wealth through the king. Candr, giving a Drishti to (the said trio in 
the said Bhava), will specifically cause more such losses. 19. If Budh is in the 12th from Lagn Pad and is yuti with, or receives a 
Drishti from a benefic, similarly there will be expenses through paternal 
relatives. A malefic so related to the said Budh will cause loss of wealth 
through disputes. 
20. O Brahmin, if Guru is in the 12th from Lagn Pad, receiving a Drishti from 
others, the expenses will be through taxes and on the person himself. 
21. O Brahmin, if Śani is in the 12th from Lagn Pad along with Mangal and 
receives a Drishti from others, the expenses will be through one‟s co-born. 
22. Gainful Sources. Whatever sources of expenses are indicated above 
with reference to the 12th from Lagn Pad, gains through similar sources will 
occur, if Labh Bhava so features with reference to Lagn Pad. 
23. The 7th Bhava from Pad (up to Sloka 27). If Rahu, or Ketu is placed in 
the 7th from Lagn Pad, the native will be troubled by disorders of the 
stomach, or by fire. 
24. Should there be Ketu in the 7th from Lagn Pad, receiving a Drishti from, 
or being yuti with another malefic, the native will be adventurous, will have 
(prematurely) grey hair and a big male organ. 
25. Should one, two, or all three of Guru, Śukr and Candr be in the 7th from 
Lagn Pad, the native will be very wealthy. 
26. Whether a benefic, or a malefic, if be exalted in the 7th from Lagn Pad, 
the native will be affluent and be famous. 
27. O Brahmin, these Yogas, as narrated by me with reference to the 7th 
from Lagn Pad, should also be considered from the 2nd of Lagn Pad. 
28. Anyone of Budh, Guru and Śukr being exalted in the 2nd from Lagn Pad 
and being with strength will make the subject rich. 
29. The Yogas so far stated by me with reference to Lagn Pad be similarly 
evaluated from Karakāńś as well. 
30-37. General. If Budh is in the 2nd from Arudh Lagn, the native will Lord 
over the whole country. Śukr in the 2nd from Lagn Pad will make one a 
poet, or a speaker. If the Dar Pad falls in an angle, or in a trine, counted from Lagn Pad, or, if Lagn Pad and Dar Pad both have strong Grahas, the 
native will be rich and be famous in his country. If the Dar Pad falls in the 
6th/ 8th/12th from Lagn Pad, then the native will be poor. If Lagn Pad and the 
7th therefrom, or an angle, a trine, an Upachaya therefrom is occupied by a 
strong Grah, there will be happiness between the husband and wife. If 
Lagn Pad and Dar Pad are mutually in Kendras, or Konas, there will be 
amity between the couple. If these be in mutually 6th/8th/12th, doubtlessly 
mutual enmity will crop up. O Brahmin, similarly mutual relationship, or 
gain, or loss through son etc. be known, based on Lagn Pad and the 
relative Bhava Pad. If Lagn Pad and Dar Pad are mutually angular, or 3rd 
and 11th, or in Konas, the native will be a king, ruling the earth. Similar 
deductions be made with reference to mutual positions of Lagn Pad and 
Dhan Pad. 
Ch. 30. Upa Pad 
1-6. O Brahmin, now I tell you about Upa Pad, the auspiciousness of which 
will confer on the native happiness from progeny, wife etc. The Pad of 
Lagn, as discussed earlier, is of prime importance. Upa Pad is calculated 
for the Bhava, following the natal Lagn. This Upa Pad is also called Gaun 
Pad. O excellent of the Brahmins, if Upa Pad is yuti with, or receives a 
Drishti from a benefic Grah, one will obtain full happiness from progeny and 
spouse. Should the Upa Pad be in a malefic‟s Rāśi, or receives a Drishti 
from, or is yuti with a malefic, one will become an ascetic and go without a 
wife. If (in the said circumstances) there be a benefic Drishti (on Upa Pad, 
or the related malefic), or a yuti, deprival of spouse will not come to pass. In 
this case Sūrya, being exalted, or in a friendly Rāśi, is not a malefic. He is a 
malefic, if in debilitation, or in an enemy‟s Rāśi. 
Notes. Regarding Upa Pad calculations, there are more than two views on 
the same Sloka of Maharishi Parashar, or an identical Sutra from Jaimini. 
In this text, the word „Anuchar‟ is used, which denotes „the Bhava, following 
the Lagn at birth‟. Normally this is Vyaya Bhava. However, when we study 
other commentaries on Jaimini (Chaukhambh Hindi edition), we are taught, 
that it is Vyaya Bhava in the case of an odd Rāśi ascending and it is Dhan 
Bhava in the case of an even Rāśi ascending. Accordingly the Pad for the 
12th, or the 2nd from Lagn is called Upa Pad. In calculating Upa Pad the 
rules mentioned in verses 4 and 5 of the previous chapter be kept in mind. 7-12. Effect from the 2nd from Upa Pad. If the 2nd from Upa Pad is a benefic 
Rāśi, or receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic, the same good 
results (as for wife and sons) will come to pass. If there is a Grah in the 2nd 
from Upa Pad in its debilitation Rāśi, or debilitation Ańś, or is yuti with a 
debilitated, or malefic Grah, there will be destruction of wife. If the said 
occupant be in its exaltation Rāśi, or Navāńś, or receives a Drishti from 
another Grah, there will be many charming and virtuous wives. Oh 
Brahmin, if Mithun happens to be the 2nd from Upa Pad, then also there will 
be many wives. O excellent of the Brahmins, if the Upa Pad, or the 2nd 
therefrom be occupied by its own Lord, or, if the said Lord is in his other 
own Bhava, the death of wife will be at advanced age. 
13-15. Wife from the 2nd of Upa Pad (up to Sloka 22). If a Grah being 
constant indicator of wife (i.e. the 7th Lord, or Śukr) is in its own Bhava, 
there will be loss of wife only at a later stage. If the Lord of Upa Pad, or the 
constant significator of wife is in exaltation, the wife will be from a noble 
family. Reverse will be the case, if he is debilitated. O Brahmin, if the 2nd 
from Upa Pad is related to a benefic, the wife will be beautiful, fortunate 
and virtuous. 
16. Should Śani and Rahu be in the 2nd from Upa Pad, the native will lose 
his wife on account of calumny, or through death. 
17. The native‟s wife will be troubled by disorder of blood, leucorrhoea 
(Pradar) etc., if Śukr and Ketu are in the 2nd from Upa Pad. 
18. Budh with Ketu in the 2nd from Upa Pad will cause breakage of bones, 
while Rahu, Śani and Sūrya will cause distress of bones. 
19-22. Budh and Rahu in the 2nd from Upa Pad will give a stout-bodied 
wife. If the 2nd from Upa Pad happens to be one of Budh‟s Rāśis and is 
tenanted by Mangal and Śani, the wife of the native will suffer from nasal 
disorders. Similarly a Rāśi of Mangal, becoming the 2nd from Upa Pad and 
occupied by Mangal and Śani, will cause nasal disorders to one‟s wife. 
Guru and Śani will, if be in the 2nd from Upa Pad, cause disorders of ears 
and/or eyes to the wife. If Budh and Mangal are placed in the 2nd from Upa 
Pad other than their own Rāśis, or, if Rahu is with Guru in the 2nd from Upa 
Pad, the native‟s wife will suffer from dental disorders. Śani and Rahu 
together in one of Śani‟s Rāśis, which is the 2nd from Upa Pad, will cause 
lameness, or windy disorders to the native‟s wife. These evils will not come to pass, if there happens to be a Yuti with, or a Drishti from a benefic (or 
from another benefic in the case of affliction being caused by a benefic 
himself). 
23-23½. O Brahmin, all these effects be deduced from the natal Lagn, Lagn 
Pad, the 7th from Upa Pad and the Lords thereof. So say Narada and 
others. 
25-28. About Sons. If Śani, Candr and Budh are together in the 9th from 
one of the said places (Sloka 23), there will be no son at all, while Sūrya, 
Guru and Rahu so placed will give a number of sons. Candr so placed will 
give a son, while a mixture of Grahas will delay the obtainment of a son. 
The son, caused by the Yuti of Sūrya, Guru and Rahu, will be strong, 
valorous, greatly successful and will destroy enemies. If Mangal and Śani 
are in the said 9th, there will be no son, or a son will be obtained by 
adoption, or brother‟s son will come in adoption. In all these cases odd 
Rāśis will yield many sons, while even Rāśis will cause only a few. 
29-30. Many Sons and Many Daughters. O Brahmin, if Simh happens to be 
Upa Pad and receives a Drishti from Candr, there will be a limited number 
of children. Similarly Kanya will cause many daughters. 
31. Co-born form Lagn Pad (up to Sloka 36). Rahu and Śani in the 3rd, or 
the 11th from Lagn Pad will destroy the co-born of the native. Rahu and 
Śani in the 11th will indicate the destruction of elder brothers and/or sisters 
and in the 3rd younger ones. 
32. If Śukr is in the 3rd, or the 11th from Lagn Pad, there would have been 
an abortion to the mother earlier. Same is the effect, if Śukr is in the 8th 
from natal Lagn, or from Lagn Pad. 
33-36. These are the effects, o Brahmin, as stated by Maharishis for the 3rd 
and the 11th from Lagn Pad. Should Candr, Guru, Budh and Mangal be in 
the 3rd, or the 11th from Lagn Pad, there will be many valorous co-born. 
Should Śani and Mangal be in the 3rd, or the 11th from Lagn Pad, or give 
Drishtis thereto, younger and elder co-born will, respectively, be destroyed. 
If Śani is alone in one of the said Bhavas, the native will be spared, while 
the co-born will die. Ketu in the 3rd, or the 11th will give abundant happiness 
from one‟s sisters. 37. Other Matters from Lagn Pad (up to Sloka 43). If the 6th from Lagn Pad 
is occupied by a malefic and is bereft of a Yuti with, or a Drishti from a 
benefic, the native will be a thief. 
38. If Rahu is in the 7th, or the 12th from Lagn Pad, or gives a Drishti to one 
of the said Bhavas, the native will be endowed with spiritual knowledge and 
be very fortunate. 
39. If Budh is in Lagn Pad, the native will Lord over a whole country, while 
Guru will make him a knower of all things. Śukr in this context denotes a 
poet/speaker (also see Ch. 29, verse 30). 
40. O excellent of the Brahmins, if benefics occupy the 2nd from Upa Pad, 
or from Lagn Pad, the native will be endowed with all kinds of wealth and 
be intelligent. 
41. One will surely become a thief, if the Lord of the 2nd from Upa Pad is in 
Dhan Bhava and is there yuti with a malefic Grah. 
42-43. O Brahmin, if Rahu is in the 2nd from the Lord of the 7th, counted 
from Upa Pad, the native will have long and projected teeth. Ketu in the 2nd 
from the Lord of the 7th, counted from Upa Pad, will cause stammering and 
Śani in the 2nd from the Lord of the 7th, counted from Upa Pad, will make 
one look ugly. Mixed will be the effects, if there are mixed Grahas. 
Ch. 31. Argala, or Intervention from Grahas 
1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have told of auspicious effects, related to 
Argala. Kindly narrate its conditions and effects. 
2-9. Formation of Argala. Maitreya, I explain below Argala to know the 
definite effects of Bhavas and Grahas. Grahas in the 4th, 2nd and the 11th 
cause Argalas, while obstructors of the Argala will be those in the 10th, 12th 
and 3rd from a Bhava, or a Grah. If the Argala causing Grah is stronger than 
the obstructing one, the former will prevail. Or, if the number of Argalas are 
more than the obstructing Grahas, then also the Argala will prevail. If there 
are 3, or more malefics in the 3rd they will cause Vipreet Argala (more 
effective intervention), which will also be harmless and be very favourable. 
The 5th is also an Argala place, while the Grah in the 9th will counteract 
such Argala. As Rahu and Ketu have retrograde motions, the Argalas and 
obstructions be also counted accordingly in a reverse manner. Maharishis say, that the Argala, caused by one Grah, will yield limited effect, by two 
medium and by more than two, excellent effects. Argalas should be 
counted from a Rāśi, or a Grah, as the case may be. The Argala, which is 
unobstructed will be fruitful, while the one duly obstructed will go astray. 
The Argala effects will be derived in the Dasha periods of the Rāśi, or Grah 
concerned. 
Notes. „Argala‟  in Sanskrit is figuratively used to denote an impediment, or 
obstruction. Some suggest, that the Argala obstruction places are 
countable from the Argala place instead of from the original place, or Grah. 
This is not logical and a glance into Gochar Vedha (obstructions during 
transits) will confirm our findings. 
10. Special. The Argala, caused by placement of a Grah in the first one 
fourth part of the Rāśi, is countered by another, placed in the 4th quarter of 
the respective obstructive Rāśi. Similarly 2nd quarter‟s Argala is eliminated 
by the 3rd quarter placement of another Grah. 
Notes. If the Argala causing Grah and the obstructing Grah are in the 
respective quarters, the obstruction will come to pass. Otherwise not. 
11-17. Argala Effects. Should there be Argala for the Arudh Pad, for the 
natal Lagn and for the 7th from both, the native will be famous and 
fortunate. A malefic, or a benefic, causing unobstructed Argala, giving a 
Drishti to Lagn will make one famous. Similarly a malefic, or a benefic, 
causing unobstructed Argala, giving a Drishti to Dhan Bhava denotes 
acquisition of wealth and grains, to Sahaj Bhava happiness from co-born, 
to Bandhu Bhava residences, quadrupeds and relatives, to Putr Bhava 
sons, grand sons and intelligence, to Ari Bhava fear from enemies, to 
Yuvati Bhava abundant wealth and marital happiness, to Randhr Bhava 
difficulties, to Dharm Bhava fortunes, to Karm Bhava royal honour, to Labh 
Bhava gains and to Vyaya Bhava expenses. The Argala by benefics will 
give various kinds of happiness, while benefic effects will be meddling with 
malefic Argalas. Argala by both benefics and malefics will yield results. 
Notes. 1. Argala can be caused by a benefic, which is known, as Subh 
Argala. This Argala can be from a malefic also, so that the benefic, causing 
Argala, stalls the malefic role. If the benefic‟s Argala is obstructed by 
another, then the benefic will become ineffective in Argala and the first-
mentioned malefic will operate freely. 2. Argala can be by a malefic with reference to a benefic, so that the native 
does not enjoy good effects, due to the benefic. This is Pap (malefic) 
Argala. If the Argala is eliminated by a benefic, or a malefic, then the first 
mentioned benefic will be at liberty to act, according to his own disposition. 
18. Should there be (unobstructed) Argala for Lagn, Putr and Dharm 
Bhava, the native will doubtlessly become a king and fortunate. 
Ch. 32. Karakatwas of the Grahas 
1-2. I now detail below Atma Karak etc., obtainable from among the 7 
Grahas, viz. Sūrya to Śani. Some say, that Rahu will become a Karak, 
when there is a state of similarity in terms of longitude between (two) 
Grahas. Yet some say, that the 8 Grahas, including Rahu, will have to be 
considered irrespective of such a state. 
3-8. Atma Karak Defined. Among the Grahas from Sūrya etc. whichever 
has traversed maximum number of degrees in a particular Rāśi is called 
Atma Karak. If the degrees are identical, then the one with more minutes of 
arc and, if the minutes are also identical, then the one with higher seconds 
of arc, have to be considered. In that case these three are called Anthya 
Karak, Madhya Karak and Upakheta. In the case of Rahu deduct his 
longitude in that particular Rāśi from 30. The Karakas will have to be 
decided, as above and, as per further rules given below. Out of these 
Karakas, Atma Karak is the most important and has a prime say on the 
native, just as the king is the most famous among the men of his country 
and is the head of all affairs and is entitled to arrest and release men. 
9-12. Importance of Atma Karak. O Brahmin, as the minister cannot go 
against the king, the other Karakas, viz. Putr Karak, Amatya Karak etc. 
cannot predominate over Atma Karak in the affairs of the native. If the Atma 
Karak is adverse, other Karakas cannot give their benefic effects. Similarly, 
if Atma Karak is favourable, other Karakas cannot predominate with their 
malefic influences. 
13-17. Other Karakas. The Grah next to Atma Karak in terms of longitude is 
called Amatya Karak. Similarly following one another in terms of longitude 
are Bhratru Karak, Matru Karak, Pitru Karak, Putr Karak, Gnati Karak and 
Stri Karak. These are Char Karakas, or inconstant significators. Some 
consider Matru Karak and Putr Karak, as identical. If two Grahas have the same longitude, both become the same Karak, in which case there will be a 
deficit of one Karak. In that circumstance consider constant significator in 
the context of benefic/malefic influence for the concerned relative. 
18-21. Constant Karakatwas. I narrate below the constant Karakatwas, as 
related to the Grahas. The stronger among Sūrya and Śukr indicates the 
father, while the stronger among Candr and Mangal indicates the mother. 
Mangal denotes sister, brother-in -law, younger brother and mother. Budh 
rules maternal relative, while Guru indicates paternal grand father. 
Husband and sons are, respectively, denoted by Śukr and Śani. From Ketu 
note wife, father, mother, parents-in law and maternal grand father. These 
are constant Karakatwas. 
22-24. Bhavas Related. These constant significances are derivable from 
the Bhavas, counted from the said constant Karakatwas. The 9th from 
Sūrya denotes father, the 4th from Candr mother, the 3rd from Mangal 
brothers, the 6th from Budh maternal uncle, the 5th from Guru sons, the 7th 
from Śukr wife and the 8th from Śani death. The learned should consider all 
these and declare related effects accordingly. 
25-30. Yog Karakas. O Brahmin, I make below a passing reference to Yog 
Karakas (mutual co-workers). Grahas become Yog Karakas, if they are in 
mutual angles identical with own Rāśis, exaltation Rāśis, or friendly Rāśis. 
In Karm Bhava a Grah will be significantly so. Grahas simply (not being in 
friendly, own, or exaltation Rāśis) in Lagn, Bandhu and Yuvati Bhava do 
not become such Yog Karakas. Even, if they be placed in other Bhavas, 
but with such dignities, as mentioned, shall become Yog Karakas. With 
such Grahas even a person of mean birth will become a king and be 
affluent. One born of royal scion, then will surely become a king. Thus the 
effects be declared, considering the number of such Grahas and the order 
the native belongs to. 
31-34. Bhava Significance. I now narrate the significance of the Bhavas. 
Tanu Bhava denotes the soul (self), Dhan family, finance, wife etc., Sahaj 
younger brothers/sisters, Putr progeny and Yuvati wife. It is also said, that 
a Grah in Putr becomes a Karak for wife. The Karakatwas of the Bhava in 
order are Sūrya, Guru, Mangal, Candr, Guru, Mangal, Śukr, Śani, Guru, 
Budh, Guru and Śani. 35-37. O excellent of the Brahmins, after knowing the merits of Tanu Bhava 
etc. the good and bad effects can be declared. Ari, Randhr and Vyaya are 
Trikas, Dusthan, or malefic Bhavas. Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh are 
Upachayas. Dhan, Putr, Randhr and Labh are Panapharas and Sahaj, Ari, 
Dharm and Vyaya are Apoklimas. Association with Trikas will inflict evils. 
Kendras and Konas (Putr and Dharm) are auspicious Bhavas, the 
association with which turns even evil into auspiciousness. 
(Also see Ch. 34 for more information) 
Ch. 33. Effects of Karakāńś 
1. O Brahmin, as laid down by Lord Brahma, I now tell you about the 
effects of Karakāńś identical with Mesh etc. (Karakāńś is the Navāńś, 
occupied by the Atma Karak Grah) 
2-8. Karakāńś in Various Rāśis. If Atma Karak happens to be in Mesh 
Navāńś, there will be nuisance from rats and cats at all times. A malefic 
joining will further increase the nuisance. Should Atma Karak be in 
Vrishabh Navāńś, happiness from quadrupeds will result. Should Atma 
Karak be in Mithun Navāńś, the native will be afflicted by itch etc. Should 
Atma Karak be in Kark Navāńś, there will be fear from water etc. If Atma 
Karak happens to be in Simh Navāńś, fear will be from tiger etc. If Atma 
Karak happens to be in Kanya Navāńś, itch, corpulence, fire etc. will cause 
trouble, while, if Atma Karak is in Tula Navāńś, he will make one a trader 
and skilful in making robes etc. Vrischik Navāńś, holding Atma Karak, will 
bring troubles from snakes etc. and also affliction to mother‟s breasts. 
There will be falls from height and conveyances etc., if it is Dhanu Navāńś, 
that is occupied by Atma Karak. Makar Navāńś in this respect denotes 
gains from water dwelling beings and conch, pearl, coral etc. If it is Kumbh 
Navāńś, holding Atma Karak, the native will construct tanks etc. And in 
Meen Navāńś the Atma Karak will grant final emancipation. The Drishti of a 
benefic will remove evils, while that of a malefic will cause no good. 
9-11. O Brahmin, if there be only benefics in Karakāńś and the Navāńś of 
Lagn receives a Drishti from a benefic, the native will undoubtedly become 
a king. Should the Kendras/Konas from the Karakāńś be occupied by 
benefics, devoid of malefic association, the native will be endowed with 
wealth and learning. The combination of benefic and malefic influence will 
in this context yield mixed results. If the Upakheta (UpaGrah, vide Ch.32 Sloka 5) is in its exaltation, or own, or friendly Rāśi and is devoid of a 
Drishti from a malefic, the native will go to heaven after death. 
12. If the Atma Karak is in the divisions of Candr, Mangal, or Śukr, the 
native will go to others wives. Otherwise the contrary will prevail. 
13-18. Effects of Grahas in the Karakāńś. O Brahmin, if Sūrya is in the 
Karakāńś, the native will be engaged in royal assignments. If the full Candr 
is there, he will enjoy pleasures and be a scholar, more so, if Śukr gives a 
Drishti to the Karakāńś. If strong Mangal is in Karakāńś, he will use the 
weapon spear, will live through fire and be an alchemist. Should strong 
Budh be Karakāńś, he will be skilful in arts and trading, be intelligent and 
educated. Guru in Karakāńś denotes one, doing good acts, endowed with 
spiritualism and Vedic learning. One will be endowed with a longevity of 
100 years, be sensuous and will look after state affairs, if Śukr is in 
Karakāńś. Śani in Karakāńś will give such livelihood, as due to the natives 
family. Rahu in Karakāńś denotes a thief, a bowman, a machinery maker 
and a doctor, treating poisonous afflictions. If Ketu be in Karakāńś, one will 
deal in elephants and be a thief. 
19-22. Rahu-Sūrya in Karakāńś. Should Rahu and Sūrya be in Karakāńś, 
there will be fear from snakes. If a benefic gives a Drishti to Rahu-Sūrya in 
Karakāńś, there will be no fear, but a malefic Drishti will bring death 
(through serpents). If Rahu and Sūrya occupy benefic Shad Vargas, being 
in Karakāńś, one will be a doctor, treating poisonous afflictions, while the 
Drishti from Mangal on Rahu-Sūrya in Karakāńś denotes, that the native 
will burn either his own house, or that of others. Budh‟s Drishti on Rahu-
Sūrya in Karakāńś will not cause the burning of one‟s own house, but that 
of others. If Rahu and Sūrya happen to be in Karakāńś and are in a 
malefic‟s Rāśi, receiving a Drishti from Guru, one will burn a house in one‟s 
neighbourhood, while the Drishti of Śukr will not cause such an event.  
23-24. Gulik in Karakāńś. Should the full Candr give a Drishti to Gulik, 
placed in the Karakāńś, the native will lose his wealth to thieves, or will 
himself be a thief. If Gulik is in Karakāńś, but does not receive a Drishti 
from others, one will administer poison to others, or will himself die of 
poisoning. Budh‟s Drishti in this context will give large testicles. 
25-29. Effects of Drishtis on Ketu in Karakāńś. If Ketu is in Karakāńś, 
receiving a Drishti from a malefic, ones ears will be severed, or one will suffer from diseases of the ears. Śukr, giving a Drishti to Ketu in Karakāńś, 
denotes one, initiated into religious order. One will be devoid of strength, if 
Budh and Śani give a Drishti to Ketu in Karakāńś. If Budh and Śukr give a 
Drishti to Ketu in Karakāńś, one will be the son of a female slave, or of a 
female remarried. With Śani‟s Drishti on Ketu in Karakāńś one will perform 
penance, or be a servant, or will be a pse udo-ascetic. Śukr and Sūrya 
together, giving a Drishti to Ketu in Karakāńś, will make one serve the king. 
Thus, o Brahmin, are told briefly the effects of Karakāńś. 
30-31. Effects of the 2nd from Karakāńś. If the 2nd from Karakāńś falls in the 
divisions of Śukr, or Mangal, one will be addicted to others‟ wives and, if 
Śukr, or Mangal give a Drishti to the 2nd from Karakāńś, the tendency will 
last till death. If Ketu is the 2nd from Karakāńś in a division of Śukr, or 
Mangal, addiction to other‟s wives will not prevail, while the position of Guru 
will cause such an evil. Rahu in the 2nd from Karakāńś will destroy wealth. 
32. Effects of the 3rd from Karakāńś. A malefic in the 3rd from Karakāńś will 
make one valorous, while a benefic in the 3rd from Karakāńś will make one 
timid. 
33-35. Effects of the 4th from Karakāńś. If the 4th from Karakāńś happens to 
be occupied by Śukr and Candr, one will own large buildings, like palaces 
etc. Similar is the effect of an exalted Grah in the said 4th. A house, made 
of stones, is denoted by the occupation of the 4th from Karakāńś by Rahu 
and Śani. Mangal and Ketu in the 4th from Karakāńś indicate a house, 
made of bricks, while Guru in the 4th from Karakāńś denotes a house, 
made of wood. Sūrya in the 4th from Karakāńś will give a house of grass. If 
Candr is in the 4th from Karakāńś, one will have union with his wife in an 
uncompounded house. 
36-40. Effects of the 5th from Karakāńś. If Rahu and Mangal are in the 5th 
from Karakāńś, one will suffer from a pulmonary consumption, more so, if 
Candr gives them a Drishti. The Drishti of Mangal on the 5th from Karakāńś 
will bring boils, or ulcers, Ketu‟s Drishti on the 5th from Karakāńś will cause 
dysentery and other diseases, caused by (impure) water. If Rahu and Gulik 
happen to be in the 5th from Karakāńś, there will be fear from mean people 
and poison. Should Budh be in the 5th from Karakāńś, the native will be an 
ascetic of the highest order, or one, holding staff. Sūrya in the 5th from 
Karakāńś denotes one, using a knife. Mangal in the 5th from Karakāńś 
denotes one, using a spear. Śani denotes a bowman, if Śani is placed in the 5th from Karakāńś. Rahu in the 5th from Karakāńś denotes a machinist. 
Ketu in the 5th from Karakāńś denotes a watch maker. Śukr in the 5th from 
Karakāńś will make one a poet and an eloquent speaker. 
41-45. Effects of Karakāńś and the 5th from there. If Guru and Candr are in 
Karakāńś, or the 5th thereof, the native will be an author. Śukr will make 
one an ordinary writer, while Budh will indicate, that the writing skills are 
less than those of an ordinary writer. Should Guru be alone, one will be a 
knower of everything, be a writer and be versed in Vedas and Vedanta 
philosophy, but not an oratorian, or a grammarian. Mangal denotes a 
logician, Budh a Mimamsaka (follower of Karma Mimansa), Śani indicates, 
that one is dull-witted in the assembly, Sūrya denotes, that one is a 
musician, Candr denotes a follower of Sankhya philosophy (of Maharishi 
Kapila, who enumerated 25 true principles with emphasis on final bliss) and 
indicates, that one is versed in rhetorics and singing and Ketu, or Rahu 
denotes, that one is a Jyotishi. Should Guru be related to the positions of 
Karakāńś, or the 5th from there, while the Karakāńś is caused by others 
than him, the effects, as stated, will effectively come to pass. Some say, 
that the 2nd from Karakāńś should also be similarly considered. 
46. Effects of the 6th from Karakāńś. If the 6th from Karakāńś is occupied by 
a malefic, the native will be an agriculturist, while he will be indolent, if a 
benefic is in the 6th from Karakāńś. The 3rd from Karakāńś should also be 
similarly considered. 
47-48. Effects of the 7th from Karakāńś. If Candr and Guru are in the 7th 
from Karakāńś, the native will beget a very beautiful wife. Śukr in the 7th 
form Karakāńś denotes a sensuous wife, while Budh in the 7th from 
Karakāńś indicates a wife, versed in arts. Sūrya in the 7th from Karakāńś 
will give a wife, who will be confining domestic core, while Śani in the 7th 
from Karakāńś denotes a wife of a higher age bracket, or a pious and/or 
sick wife. Rahu in the 7th from Karakāńś will bring a widow in marriage. 
49. Effects of the 8th from Karakāńś. If a benefic, or the Grah, owning the 
8th from Karakāńś, happens to be in the 8th from Karakāńś, the native will 
be long-lived, while a malefic, placed in the 8th from Karakāńś, will reduce 
the life span. Drishti/Yuti of both benefics and malefics will yield a medium 
span of life. 50-56. Effects of the 9th from Karakāńś. If the 9th from Karakāńś receives a 
Drishti from, or is occupied by a benefic, the native will be truthful, devoted 
to elders and attached to his own religion. If a malefic gives a Drishti to, or 
occupies the 9th from Karakāńś, one will be attached to his religion in 
boyhood, but will take to falsehood in old age. If Śani and Rahu, one will 
betray his elders and be adverse to ancient learning. If Guru and Sūrya, 
one will betray his elders and will be disobedient to them. Should Mangal 
and Śukr give a Drishti to, or occupy the 9th from Karakāńś and are joining 
in six identical Vargas, a female, ill-related to the native, will die. Budh and 
Candr giving a Drishti to, or occupying the 9th from Karakāńś and joining in 
six identical Vargas will cause imprisonment of the native, due to 
association with a female not of his own. If Guru is alone, related to the 9th 
from Karakāńś by Drishti, or by Yuti, the native will be addicted to females 
and be devoted to sensual enjoyments. 
57-60. Effects of the 10th from Karakāńś. If the 10th from Karakāńś receives 
a Drishti from, or is conjoined by a benefic, the native will have firm riches, 
be sagacious, strong and intelligent. A malefic, giving a Drishti to the 10th 
from Karakāńś, or occupying this Bhava, will cause harm to his profession 
and deprive him of paternal bliss. Budh and Śukr, giving a Drishti to the 10th 
from Karakāńś, or conjoining this Bhava, will confer many gains in business 
and will make him do many great deeds. Sūrya and Candr, giving a Drishti 
to the 10th from Karakāńś, or conjoining this place and receiving a Drishti 
from, or be in Yuti with Guru, the native will acquire a kingdom. 
61-62. Effects of the 11th from Karakāńś. If the 11th from Karakāńś receives 
a Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic, the native will enjoy happiness fro m 
co-born apart from gaining in every undertaking of his. If a malefic is in the 
11th from Karakāńś, the native will gain by questionable means, be famous 
and valorous. 
63-74. Effects of the 12th from Karakāńś. If the 12th from Karakāńś has a 
benefic, the expenses will be on good account, while a malefic in the 12th 
from Karakāńś will cause bad expenses. If the 12th from Karakāńś is 
vacant, then also good effects will follow. If there happens to be a benefic 
Grah in exaltation, or in own Bhava in the 12th from Karakāńś, or, if Ketu is 
so placed and receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic, one will 
attain heaven after death. One will attain full enlightenment, if Ketu is in the 
12th identical with Mesh, or Dhanu and receives a Drishti from a benefic. If 
Ketu is in the 12th from Karakāńś, receiving a Drishti from a malefic, or is there yuti with a malefic, one will not attain full enlightenment. If Sūrya and 
Ketu are in the 12th from Karakāńś, the native will worship Lord Shiva. 
Candr and Ketu denotes a worshiper of Gauri. Śukr and Ketu of Lakshmi 
and a wealthy person. Mangal and Ketu of Lord Subramanya. Rahu will 
make one worship Durga, or some mean deity. Ketu alone denotes 
Subramanya‟s, or Ganesh‟s worshipper. If Śani is in the 12th from Karakāńś 
in a malefic‟s Rāśi, one will worship mean deities. Śukr and Śani in the 12th 
from Karakāńś in a malefic‟s Rāśi will also make one worship mean deities. 
Similar inferences can be drawn from the 6th Navāńś, counted from Amatya 
Karak‟s Navāńś. 
75-76. Miscellaneous Matters (up to Sloka 84). O Brahmin, if there are two 
malefics in a Kon from Karakāńś, the native will have knowledge of 
Mantras and Tantras (formulas for the attainment of super-human powers). 
If a malefic simultaneously gives a Drishti to two malefics in a Kon from 
Karakāńś, the native will use his learnings of Mantras and Tantras for 
malevolent purposes, while a benefic‟s Drishti will make him use the 
learnings for public good.  
77-84½. If Candr is in the Karakāńś, receiving a Drishti from Śukr, the 
native will be an alchemist and, if receiving a Drishti from Budh the native 
will be a doctor capable of curing all diseases. If Candr is in the 4th from 
Karakāńś and receives a Drishti from Śukr, the native will be afflicted by 
white leprosy. If receiving a Drishti from Mangal, the native will have blood 
and bilious disorders and, if receiving a Drishti from Ketu, the native will 
suffer from black leprosy. Should Rahu and Mangal be in the 4th, or 5th from 
Karakāńś, the native will suffer from pulmonary consumption and, if 
simultaneously there happens to be Candr‟s Drishti on the 4th, or the 5th, 
this affliction will be certain. Mangal alone in the 4th, or the 5th will cause 
ulcers. If Ketu is in the 4th, or the 5th, one will suffer from dysentery and 
afflictions, due to (impure) water. Rahu and Gulik will make one a doctor, 
curing poisonous afflictions, or will cause troubles through poison. Should 
Śani be alone in the 4th, or 5th, the native will be skillful in archery. Ketu 
lonely placed in the 4th, or the 5th will make one a maker of watches etc. 
Budh lonely placed in the 4th, or the 5th will make one an ascetic of the 
highest order, or an ascetic, holding staff. Rahu, Sūrya and Mangal, 
respectively, in these places denote a machinist, a knife user and a spear, 
or arrow user. 85-86. Candr and Guru in the Karakāńś, or in the 5th therefrom denotes a 
writer well versed in all branches of learning. The grade of writership will 
comparatively descend in the case of Śukr and even further in the case of 
Budh.  
87-92½. Grahas in the 5th from Karakāńś. Should Śukr be in the 5th from 
Karakāńś, the native will be eloquent and a poet. Guru denotes, that he be 
an exponent and be all knowing, but be unable to speak in an assembly. 
He will be further a grammarian and a scholar in Vedas and Upanishads. 
Śani will make one ineffective in an assembly, while Budh will make him 
skilful in Karma Mimansa. Mangal in Karakāńś, or the 5th therefrom will 
make one justice, while Candr in Karakāńś, or the 5th from there denotes a 
Sankhya Yogi, a rhetoric, or a singer. Sūrya in the 5th from Karakāńś will 
make one learned in Vedanta and music. Ketu will make one a 
mathematician and skilful in Jyotish. Should Guru be related to the said 
Ketu, these learnings will be by inheritance. All these as well apply to 2nd 
and 3rd from Karakāńś and to the Karakāńś itself apart from applying to the 
5th from Karakāńś. 
93-93½. Should Ketu be in the 2nd, or 3rd from Karakāńś, the native will be 
defective in speech, more so, if a malefic gives a Drishti to Ketu, as above. 
94-99. If malefics be in Karakāńś, Arudh Lagn and the 2nd and 8th from 
these places, there will be Kemadrum Yog, the effects of which will be still 
severer, if Candr‟s Drishti happens to be there. The effects, due for these 
Yogas, will come to pass in the Dasha periods of the Rāśis, or Grahas 
concerned. Kemadrum Yog will operate additionally, if there are malefics in 
the 2nd and 8th from the Rāśi, whose Dasha will be in currency. The results 
of such Yog will also be inauspicious. If the 2nd and 8th in the Kundali, cast 
for the beginning of a Dasha, have malefics, then also Kemadrum prevails 
throughout the Dasha. 
Ch. 34. Yoga Karakas 
1. O Brahmin, thus I have told you about the effects, derivable through 
Karakāńś. Now listen to the effects, arising out of lordships of Grahas over 
Bhavas. 
2-7. Nature due to Lordships of Grahas. Benefics, owning Kendras, will not 
give benefic effects, while malefics, owning Kendras, will not remain inauspicious. The Lord of a Kon will give auspicious results. The Lord of 
Lagn is specially auspicious, as Lagn is a Kendr, as well as a Kon. Putr and 
Dharm Bhava are specially for wealth, while Yuvati and Karm Bhava are 
specially for happiness. Any Grah, owning Sahaj, Ari, or Labh Bhava, will 
give evil effects. The effects, due to the Lords of Vyaya and Randhr Bhava, 
will depend on their association. In each group the significance will be in 
the ascending order. Randhr‟s Lord is not auspicious, as he owns the 12th 
from Dharm Bhava. If the Lord of Randhr Bhava simultaneously owns 
Sahaj, Yuvati, or Labh Bhava, he will prove specifically harmful, while his 
simultaneous ownership of a Kon will bestow auspicious effects. The Grah, 
owning a predominant Bhava, will stall the effects, due to another, owning a 
less significant Bhava and will give his own results. Randhr‟s lordship of 
Sūrya and Candr is not evil. 
8-10. Natural Benefics and Malefics. Guru and Śukr are benefics, while 
Candr is mediocre in benefice and Budh is neutral (a benefic, when 
associated with a benefic and a malefic, when related to a malefic). 
Malefics are Sūrya, Śani and Mangal. Full Candr, Budh, Guru and Śukr are 
stronger in the ascending order. Weak Candr, Sūrya, Śani and Mangal are 
stronger (in malefic disposition) in the ascending order. In revealing 
maleficence, due to rulership of Kendras, Candr, Budh, Guru and Śukr are 
significant in the ascending order. 
11-12. Lordships of Kendras and Konas. If there be an exchange between 
a Lord of a Kendr and a Lord of a Kon, or, if a Lord of a Kendr is yuti with a 
Lord of a Kon in a Kendr, or in a Kon, or, if a Lord of a Kon is in a Kendr, or 
vice versa, or, if there happens to be a full Drishti between a Lord of a 
Kendr and a Lord of a Kon, they cause a Yog. One born in such a Yog will 
become a king and be famous. 
13. If one and the same Grah gets the lordships of a Kon, as well as a 
Kendr, or, if a Grah is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, it will prove specially a Yog 
Karak. 
14. Lordship of Kendr. It has been said, that a malefic, owning a Kendr, will 
become auspicious, which is true, only when it simultaneously Lords over a 
Kon and not by merely owning a Kendr. 15. If the Lords of a Kendr, or a Kon own simultaneously an evil Bhava, he 
does not cause a Raj Yog by mere relations stipulated (as per Ch. 34, 
Slokas 11 and 12). 
16. Rahu and Ketu. Rahu and Ketu give predominantly the effects, as due 
to their yuti with a Bhava Lord, or, as due to the Bhava they occupy. 
17. If Rahu and/or Ketu are in Kendr, receiving a Drishti from, or in 
association with the Lord of a Kon, or of a Kendr, it will become Yog Karak. 
18. O Maharishi Parashar, please narrate, according to the Rāśis rising, as 
to which Grah is a Yog Karak and which is inauspicious. 
19-22. Grahas and Mesh Lagn. O Brahmin, listen to these with examples. 
Even though Mangal is the Lord of Randhr Bhava, he will be helpful to 
auspicious Grahas. Śani, Budh and Śukr are malefics. Auspicious are Guru 
and Sūrya. The mere Yuti of Śani with Guru will not produce auspicious 
effects (although they own a Kon and a Kendr). If Guru is at the disposal of 
a malefic, he will surely give inauspicious results. Śukr is a direct 
(independent) killer. Śani etc. will also inflict death, if associated with an 
adverse Grah (Śukr). 
23-24. Grahas and Vrishabh Lagn. Guru, Śukr and Candr are malefics. 
Śani and Sūrya are auspicious. Śani will cause Raj Yog. Budh is somewhat 
inauspicious. The Guru group (Guru, Candr and Śukr) and Mangal will 
inflict death. 
25-26. Grahas and Mithun Lagn. Mangal, Guru and Sūrya are malefics, 
while Śukr is the only auspicious Grah. The Yuti of Guru with Śani is similar 
to that for Mesh Lagn. Candr is the prime killer, but it is dependant on her 
association. 
27-28. Grahas and Kark Lagn. Śukr and Budh are malefics, Mangal, Guru 
and Candr are auspicious. Mangal is capable of conferring a full-fledged 
Yog and giving auspicious effects. Śani and Sūrya are killers and give 
effects, according to their associations. 
29-30. Grahas and Simh Lagn. Budh, Śukr and Śani are malefics. 
Auspicious effects will be given by Mangal, Guru and Sūrya. Guru‟s Yuti 
with Śukr (though, respectively, Kon and Kendr Lords) will not produce auspicious results. Śani and Candr are killers, who will give effects, 
according to their associations. 
31-32. Grahas and Kanya Lagn. Mangal, Guru and Candr are malefics, 
while Budh and Śukr are auspicious. Śukr‟s Yuti with Budh will produce 
Yog. Śukr is a killer as well. Sūrya‟s role will depend on his association. 
33-34. Grahas and Tula Lagn. Guru, Sūrya and Mangal are malefics. 
Auspicious are Śani and Budh. Candr and Budh will cause Raj Yog. 
Mangal is a killer. Guru and other malefics will also acquire a disposition to 
inflict death. Śukr is neutral. 
35-36. Grahas and Vrischik Lagn. Śukr, Budh and Śani are malefics. Guru 
and Candr are auspicious. Sūrya, as well as Candr are Yog Karakas. 
Mangal is neutral. Śukr and other malefics acquire the quality of causing 
death. 
37-38. Grahas and Dhanu Lagn. Only Śukr is inauspicious. Mangal and 
Sūrya are auspicious. Sūrya and Budh are capable of conferring a Yog. 
Śani is a killer, Guru is neutral. Śukr acquires killing powers. 
39-40. Grahas and Makar Lagn. Mangal, Guru and Candr are malefics, 
Śukr and Budh are auspicious. Śani will not be a killer on his own. Mangal 
and other malefics will inflict death. Sūrya is neutral. Only Śukr is capable 
of causing a superior Yog. 
41-42. Grahas and Kumbh Lagn. Guru, Candr and Mangal are malefics, 
while Śukr and Śani are auspicious. Śukr is the only Grah, that causes Raj 
Yog. Guru, Sūrya and Mangal are killers. Budh gives meddling effects. 
43-44. Grahas and Meen Bhava. Śani, Śukr, Sūrya and Budh are malefics. 
Mangal and Candr are auspicious. Mangal and Guru will cause a Yog. 
Though Mangal is a killer, he will not kill the native (independently). Śani 
and Budh are killers. 
45-46. General. Thus the auspicious and inauspicious effects, derivable 
through the Grahas, due to their lordship, according to the rising Rāśi, have 
to be estimated. Apart the effects, due to Nabhash Yogas etc., should also 
be known, which I narrate, as under. 
Ch. 35. Nabhash Yogas 1-2. O excellent of the Brahmins, explained below are 32 Nabhash Yogas, 
which have a total of 1800 different varieties. These consist of 3 Asraya 
Yogas, 2 Dala Yogas, 20 Akriti Yogas and 7 Sankhya Yogas. 
3-6. Names of Nabhash Yogas. The 3 Asraya Yogas are Rajju, Musala and 
Nala Yogas. The 2 Dala Yogas are Maal and Sarpa. The 20 Akriti Yogas 
are Gada, Sakat, Shringatak, Vihag, Hal, Vajr, Kamal, Vapi, Yup, Shar, 
Shakti, Danda, Nisk, Koot, Chatr, Dhanushi (Chap), Ardh, Candr, Chakr 
and Samudr Yogas. The 7 Sankhya Yogas are Vallaki, Daam, Paash, 
Kedara, Sool, Yuga and Gola Yogas. Thus these are 32 in total. 
7. Rajju, Musala and Nala Yogas. All the Grahas in Movable Rāśis cause 
Rajju Yog. All the Grahas in Fixed Rāśis cause Musala Yog. All the Grahas 
in Dual Rāśis cause Nala Yog. 
8. Maal and Sarpa Yogas. If 3 Kendras are occupied by benefics, Maal Yog 
is produced, while malefics so placed will cause Bhujang, or Sarpa Yog. 
These Yogas, respectively, produce benefic and malefic results. 
9-11. Gada, Sakat, Vihag, Shringatak, Hal, Vajr and Yav Yogas. If all the 
Grahas occupy two successive Kendras, Gada Yog is formed. Sakat Yog 
occurs, when all the Grahas are disposed in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava. If all 
confine to Bandhu and Karm Bhava, then Vihag Yog occurs. All Grahas in 
Lagn, Putr and Dharm Bhava cause Shringatak Yog, while all Grahas in 
Dhan, Ari and Karm Bhava, or in Sahaj, Yuvati and Labh Bhava, or in 
Bandhu, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava cause Hal Yog. Vajr Yog is caused by 
all benefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, or all malefics in Bandhu and Karm 
Bhava. In a contrary situation, i.e. all benefics in Bandhu and Karm Bhava, 
or all malefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, Yav Yog is generated. 
12. Kamal and Vapi Yogas. If all the Grahas are in the 4 Kendras, Kamal 
Yog is produced. If all of them happen to be in all the Apoklimas, or in all 
the Panapharas, Vapi Yog occurs. 
13. Yup, Shar, Shakti and Danda Yogas. If all the 7 Grahas are in the 4 
Bhavas, commencing from Lagn, they cause Yup Yog, if from Bandhu, 
Shar Yog occurs, if from Yuvati, Shakti Yog occurs and, if from Karm, 
Danda Yog is formed. 
14. Nauka, Koot, Chatr and Chap Yogas. If all the Grahas occupy the 
seven Bhavas from Lagn, Nauka Yog occurs, if from Bandhu, Koot Yog is formed, if from Yuvati, Chatr Yog occurs and, if from Karm, Chap Yog 
occurs. Here again the Grahas should occupy seven continuous Bhavas. 
Quoted from Saravali. If the seven Grahas occupy continuously seven 
Bhavas, commencing from a Bhava, which is not angular to the Lagna, the 
Yoga produced is known, as Ardh Candra Yoga. 
15. Chakr and Samudr Yogas. If all the Grahas occupy six alternative 
Rāśis, commencing from Lagn, Chakr Yog is formed. Samudr Yog is 
produced, if all Grahas occupy six alternative Rāśis, commencing from 
Dhan Bhava. 
16-17. Sankhya Yogas. If all Grahas are in one Rāśi, Gola Yog is formed, if 
in 2, Yuga Yog is formed, if in 3, Sool Yog occurs, if in 4, Kedara Yog 
occurs, if in 5, Paash Yog is formed, if in 6, Daam Yog occurs and, if in 7, 
Veena Yog is produced. None of these seven Yogas will be operable, if 
another Nabhash Yog is derivable.

Ch. 36. Many Other Yogas 
1-2. Benefic and Malefic Yogas. If there be a benefic in Lagn, Subh Yog is 
produced, while a malefic in Lagn causes Asubh Yog. Benefics in both 
Vyaya and Dhan Bhava cause Subh Yog. Malefics in both Vyaya and Dhan 
Bhava cause Asubh Yog. One born in Subh Yog will be eloquent, charming 
and virtuous, while his counterpart will be sensuous, will do sinful acts and 
will enjoy (swallow) others‟ wealth. 
3-4. Gaj Kesari Yog. Should Guru be in a Kendr from Lagn, or from Candr 
and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from benefic, avoiding at the same 
time debilitation, combustion and inimical Rāśi, Gaj Kesari Yog is caused. 
One born in Gaj Kesari Yog will be splendourous, wealthy, intelligent, 
endowed with many laudable virtues and will please the king. 
5-6. Amal Yog. If there be exclusively a benefic in the 10th from Lagn, or 
Candr, Amal Yog exists. Amal Yog will confer fame, lasting till Candr and 
stars exist and will make the native honoured by the king, enjoy abundant 
pleasures, charitable, fond of relatives, helpful to others, pious and 
virtuous. 7-8. Parvat Yog. Benefics in Kendras will produce Parvat Yog, as Yuvati 
and Randhr Bhava are vacant, or are occupied by only benefics. One born 
in Parvat Yog will be wealthy, eloquent, charitable, learned in Shastras, 
fond of mirth, famous, splendourous and be the leader of a city. 
9-10. Kahal Yog. Should Bandhu‟s Lord and Guru be in mutual Kendras, 
while Lagn‟s Lord is strong, Kahal Yog occurs. Alternatively Bandhu‟s Lord, 
being in his own, or exaltation Rāśi, should be yuti with Karm‟s Lord. In 
effect the native will be energetic, adventurous, charming, endowed with a 
complete Army, consisting of chariots, elephants, horses and infantry and 
he will Lord over a few villages. 
11-12. Chamar Yog. If Lagn‟s Lord is exalted in a Kendr and receives a 
Drishti from Guru, Chamar Yog is formed. This Yog also occurs, if two 
benefics are in Lagn, or Dharm, or Karm, or Yuvati Bhava. The effects of 
Chamar Yog are: the native will be a king, or honoured by the king, long 
lived, scholarly, eloquent and versed in all arts. 
13-14. Shankh Yog. If Lagn‟s Lord is strong, while the Lords of Putr and Ari 
Bhava are in mutual Kendras, then what is known, as Shankh Yog, is 
produced. Alternatively, if Lagn‟s Lord along with Karm‟s Lord is in a 
Movable Rāśi, while Dharm‟s Lord is strong, Shankh Yog is obtained. One 
born with Shankh Yog will be endowed with wealth, spouse and sons. He 
will be kindly disposed, propitious, intelligent, meritorious and long-lived. 
15-16. Bhairi Yog. If Vyaya, Tanu, Dhan and Yuvati Bhava are occupied, as 
Dharm‟s Lord is strong, the native obtains Bhairi Yog. Again another kind of 
Bhairi Yog is formed, if Śukr, Guru and Lagn‟s Lord are in a Kendr, while 
Dharm‟s Lord is strong. The results of Bhairi Yog are: the native will be 
endowed with wealth, wife and sons. He will be a king, be famous, virtuous 
and endowed with good behaviour, happiness and pleasures. 
17. Mridang Yog. If Lagn‟s Lord is strong and others occupy Kendras, 
Konas, own Bhavas, or exaltation Rāśis, Mridang Yog is formed. The 
native concerned will be a king, or equal to a king and be happ y. 
18. Shrinath Yog. If Yuvati‟s Lord is in Karm Bhava, while Karm‟s Lord is 
exalted and yuti with Dharm‟s Lord, Shrinath Yog takes place. The native 
with Shrinath Yog will be equal to Lord Devendra (god of gods). 19-20. Sharad Yog. Should Karm‟s Lord be in Putr Bhava, while Budh is in 
a Kendr, as Sūrya with strength is in Simh, Sharad Yog is formed. This will 
again be obtained, if Guru, or Budh is in a Kon to Candr, while Mangal is in 
Labh Bhava. One born in either kind of Yog will obtain wealth, spouse an d 
sons, be happy, scholarly, dear to the king, pious and virtuous. 
21-22. Matsya Yog. Benefics in Dharm and Tanu Bhava, mixed Grahas in 
Putr Bhava and malefics in Bandhu and Randhr Bhava: this array of 
Grahas at birth will produce Matsya Yog. In effect the native will be a 
Jyotishi, be a synonym of kindness, be virtuous, strong, beautiful, famous, 
learned and pious.  
23-24. Kurm Yog. If Putr, Ari and Yuvati Bhava are occupied by benefic 
Grahas identical with own Bhava, or exaltation, or friendly Rāśi, while 
malefics are in Sahaj, Labh and Tanu Bhava, in own Bhava, or in 
exaltation, Kurm Yog is formed. The results of Kurm Yog are: the native will 
be a king. be courageous, virtuous, famous, helpful, happy. He will be a 
leader of men. 
25-26. Khadg Yog. Should there be an exchange of Rāśis between the 
Lords of Dhan and Dharm Bhava, as Lagn‟s Lord is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, 
Khadg Yog is obtained. One with Khadg Yog will be endowed with wealth, 
fortunes and happiness, be learned in Shastras, be intelligent, mighty, 
grateful and skilful. 
27-28. Lakshmi Yog. If Dharm‟s Lord is in a Kendr identical with his 
Mooltrikon Rāśi, or own Rāśi, or in exaltation, while Lagn‟s Lord is 
endowed with strength, Lakshmi Yog occurs. The native with Lakshmi Yog 
will be charming, virtuous, kingly in status, endowed with many sons and 
abundant wealth. He will be famous and of high moral merits.  
29-30. Kusum Yog. Śukr in a Kendr, Candr in a Kon along with a benefic 
and Śani in Karm Bhava: these Grahas thus cause Kusum Yog for one 
born in a Fixed Rāśi ascending. Such a native will be a king, or equal to 
him, be charitable, will enjoy pleasures, be happy, prime among his race 
men, virtuous and red-lettered. 
31-32. Kalanidhi Yog. If Guru is placed in Dhan, or Putr Bhava and 
receives a Drishti from Budh and Śukr, Kalanidhi Yog is caused. In effect 
the native will be virtuous, honoured by the kings, bereft of diseases, be 
happy, wealthy and learned. 33-34. Kalpa Drum Yog. Note the following four Grahas: Lagn‟s Lord , the 
dispositor of Lagn‟s Lord (a), the dispositor of the Grah “a” (b), the Navāńś 
dispositor of the Grah “b”. If all these are disposed in Kendras and in Konas 
from Lagn, or are exalted, Kalpa Drum Yog exists. One with Kalpa Drum 
Yog will be endowed with all kinds of wealth, be a king, pious, strong, fond 
of war and merciful. 
35-36. Trimurthi Yogas. Counted from Dhan‟s Lord, if benefics occupy the 
2nd, 12th and 8th, Hari Yog is formed. If the 4th, 9th and 8th with reference to 
the Rāśi, occupied by Yuvati‟s Lord, are occupied by benefics, Hara Yog is 
obtainable. Brahma Yog is generated, if, counted from Lagn‟s Lord, 
benefics are in the 4th, 10th and 11th Rāśis. One born in anyone of the said 
three Yogas will be happy, learned and endowed with wealth and sons. 
37. Lagn Adhi Yog. Should benefics be in Yuvati and Randhr Bhava, 
counted from Lagn and be devoid of Yuti with and/or Drishti from malefics, 
Lagn Adhi Yog is produced, making one a great person, learned in 
Shastras and happy. 
38-39. Effects of Lagn‟s Lord‟s Division Dignities. Lagn‟s Lord in Parijatāńś 
will make one happy, in Vargottama will give immunity to diseases, in 
Gopurāńś will make one rich with wealth and grains, in Simhasanāńś will 
make one a king, in Paravatāńś will make one a scholar, in Devalokāńś will 
make one opulent and endowed with conveyances and in Iravatāńś will 
make one famous and honoured by kings. (Vargottama indicates a Grah, 
occupying the same Rāśi and the same Navāńś) 
Ch. 37. Candr’s Yogas 
1. If Candr with reference to Sūrya is in a Kendr, one‟s wealth, intelligence 
and skill will be little, if in a Panaphara, will be meddling, if in a Apoklima, 
will be excellent. 
2-4. In the case of a day birth, if Candr, placed in its own Navāńś, or in a 
friendly Navāńś, receives a Drishti from Guru, one will be endowed with 
wealth and happiness. One born at night time will enjoy similar effects, if 
Candr is in its own Navāńś, or in a friendly Navāńś, receiving a Drishti from 
Śukr. In a contrary situation, the Drishti from Guru, or from Śukr on Candr 
will make one go with little wealth, or even without that. 5. Adhi Yog from Candr. If benefics occupy the 8th, 6th and 7th, counted from 
Candr, Adhi Yog obtains. According to the strength of the participating 
Grahas, the native concerned will be either a king, or a minister, or an Army 
chief. 
6. Dhan Yog. Should all the (three) benefics be Upachaya, counted from 
Candr, one will be very affluent. With two benefics, placed in the 3rd, the 6th, 
the 10th and the 11th, one will have medium effects in regard to wealth. If a 
single benefic is there, the wealth will be negligible. 
7-10. Sunaph, Anaph and Duradhar. If there is a Grah other than Sūrya, in 
the 2nd from Candr, Sunaph Yog is formed, if in the 12th from Candr, Anaph 
Yog is formed and, if in the 2nd and 12th from Candr, Duradhar Yog is 
caused. One with Sunaph Yog will be a king, or equal to a king, endowed 
with intelligence, wealth, fame and self-earned wealth. One born in Anaph 
Yog will be a king, be free from diseases, virtuous, famous, charming and 
happy. One born in Duradhar Yog will enjoy pleasures, will be charitable 
and endowed with wealth, conveyances and excellent serving force. 
11-13. Kema Drum Yog. Excluding Sūrya, should there be no Grah with 
Candr, or in the 2nd and/or 12th from Candr, or in a Kendr from Lagn, Kema 
Drum Yog is formed. One born in Kema Drum Yog will be very much 
reproached, will be bereft of intelligence, learning, reduced to penury and 
perils. 
Ch. 38. Sūrya’s Yogas 
1. Vesi, Vosi and Abhayachari Yogas. Barring Candr, if a Grah among 
Mangal etc. be in the 2nd from Sūrya, Vesi Yog is formed, if in the 12th from 
Sūrya, Vosi Yog is formed and if in both the 2nd and the 12th from Sūrya, 
Ubhayachari Yog is caused. 
2-3. Effects of Vesi, Vosi and Ubhayachari Yogas. One born in Vesi Yog 
will be even sighted, truthful, long-bodied, indolent, happy and endowed 
with negligible wealth. One born with Vosi Yog will be skilful, charitable and 
endowed with fame, learning and strength. The Ubhayachari native will be 
a king, or equal to a king and be happy. 
4. Benefics, causing Vesi, Vosi, or Ubhayachari Yogas, will give the above-
mentioned effects, while malefics will produce contrary effects. Ch. 39. Raj Yog 
1-2. O excellent of the Brahmins, I now narrate below the Raj Yogas, 
making one entitled to royal honour. These were told to Parvati by Lord 
Shiva once upon a time, the gist of which is, as follows. 
3-5. Raj Yogas are to be known from the Karakāńś Lagn and the natal 
Lagn. On the one hand the pair of Atma Karak and Putr Karak should be 
considered and on the other hand the natal Lagn‟s Lord and Putr‟s Lord 
should be taken into consideration. The effects, due to such association, 
will be full, or a half, or a quarter, according to their strengths. 
6-7. Maha Raj Yog. Should Lagn‟s Lord and Putr‟s Lord exchange their 
Rāśis, or, if Atma Karak and Putr Karak (Char) are in Lagn, or in Putr 
Bhava, or in the exaltation Rāśi, or in own Rāśi, or in own Navāńś, 
receiving a Drishti from a benefic, Maha Raj Yog is produced. The native 
so born will be famous and happy. 
8. If Lagn‟s Lord and Atma Karak are in Tanu, Putr, or Yuvati Bhava, yuti 
with, or receiving a Drishti from a benefic, a Raj Yog is formed. 
9-10. Should there be benefics in the 2nd, the 4th and the 5th, counted either 
from Lagn‟s Lord, or from Atma Karak Rāśi, one will become a king. 
Similarly malefics in the 3rd and 6th from Lagn‟s Lord, or from Atma Karak 
Rāśi will make one a king. 
11. One will be related to royal circles, if Śukr is the Karakāńś, or in the 5th 
there from, or in Lagn, or in Arudh Lagn, receiving a Drishti from, or yuti 
with Guru, or Candr. 
12. Even, if a single Grah gives a Drishti to the natal Lagn, or Hora Lagn, or 
Ghatik Lagn, the native will become a king. 
13-14. If the Shad Vargas of Lagn are occupied, or receive a Drishti from 
one and the same Grah, a Raj Yog is doubtlessly formed. Accordingly, if 
the Drishti is full, half, or one fourth, results will be in order full, medium and 
negligible.  
15. If the 3 Lagnas (natal, Hora and Ghatik) are occupied by Grahas in 
exaltation, or in own Rāśi, or, if the natal Lagn, the Dreshkan Lagn and the 
Navāńś Lagn have exalted Grahas, Raj Yog is formed. 16. If Candr and a benefic are in the Arudh Lang, as Guru is in the 2nd from 
the natal Lagn and both these places are receiving Drishtis from Grahas in 
exaltation, or Grahas in own Rāśi, there will be a Raj Yog. 
17. If Lagn, Dhan and Bandhu Bhava are occupied by benefics, while a 
malefic is in Sahaj Bhava, one will become a king, or equal to a king. 
18. The native will be wealthy, if one among Candr, Guru, Śukr and Budh is 
exalted in Dhan Bhava. 
19. If Ari, Randhr and Sahaj Bhava are occupied by debilitated Grahas, as 
Lagn‟s Lord is exalted, or is in own Bhava and gives a Drishti to Lagn, there 
is a Raj Yog. 
20. Again a Raj Yog is formed, if Ari‟s, Randhr‟s and Vyaya‟s Lords are in 
fall, or in inimical Rāśis, or in combustion, as Lagn‟s Lord, placed in his own 
Rāśi, or in its exaltation Rāśi, gives a Drishti to Lagn. 
21. If Karm‟s Lord, placed in his own Bhava, or in its exaltation Rāśi, gives 
a Drishti to Lagn, a Raj Yog is formed. Similar is the case, if benefics are in 
Kendras. 
22. If the Atma Karak Grah is in a benefic‟s Rāśi/Navāńś, the native will be 
wealthy. If there are benefics in Kendras from Karakāńś Lagn, he will 
become a king. 
23. If the Arudh Lagn and Dar Pad are in mutual Kendras, or in mutual 
Sahaj/Labh Bhavas, or in mutual Konas, the native will doubtlessly become 
a king. 
24. If two, or all of Bhava, Hora, Ghatik Lagnas are receiving a Drishti from 
exalted Grahas, a Raj Yog is formed. 
25. If Bhava, Hora and Ghatik Lagnas, their Dreshkanas and Navāńśas, or 
the said Lagnas and their Navāńśas, or the said Lagnas and their 
Dreshkanas receive a Drishti from a Grah, a Raj Yog is formed. 
26-27. If Arudh Pad is occupied by an exalted Grah, particularly Candr in 
exaltation, or by Guru and/or Śukr (with, or without exaltation), while there 
is no Argala by a malefic, the native will become a king. If the Arudh Pad is a benefic Rāśi, containing Candr, while Guru is in Dhan Bhava, the same 
effect will prevail. 
28. Even, if one among Ari‟s, Randhr‟s and Vyaya‟s Lords, being in 
debilitation, gives a Drishti to Lagn, there will be a Raj Yog. 
29-31. The native will become a king, if a Grah, ruling Bandhu, Karm, 
Dhan, or Labh, gives a Drishti to Lagn, while Śukr gives a Drishti to the 11th 
from Arudh Lagn, as Arudh Lagn is occupied by a benefic. The same effect 
will be obtained, if a debilitated Grah gives a Drishti to Lagn and is placed 
in Ari, or Randhr Bhava. Again similar result will prevail, if a debilitated 
Grah, placed in Sahaj, or Labh Bhava, gives a Drishti to Lagn. 
32. I now tell you of the Raj Yogas, based on the Grahas with different 
dignities and on the Drishtis and Yutis of the Grahas. 
33-34. Dharm‟s Lord is akin to a minister and more especially Putr‟s Lord. If 
these two Grahas mutually give a Drishti, the native will obtain a kingdom. 
Even, if these two are yuti in any Bhava, or, if they happen to be placed in 
mutually 7th places, one born of royal scion will become a king. 
35. The native will attain a kingdom, if Bandhu‟s Lord is in Karm Bhava and 
Karm‟s Lord is in Bandhu Bhava and, if these Grahas give a Drishti to 
Putr‟s and Dharm‟s Lords. 
36. If the Lords of Putr, Karm, Bandhu and Lagn are yuti in Dharm Bhava, 
one will become a ruler with fame, spreading over the four directions. 
37. Should the Lord of Bandhu, or of Karm Bhava join either the Putr‟s 
Lord, or Dharm‟s Lord, the native will obtain a kingdom. 
38. If Putr‟s Lord is in Lagn, Bandhu, or Karm Bhava, yuti with Dharm‟s 
Lord, or Lagn Lord, the native will become a king. 
39. Should Guru be in his own Rāśi identical with Dharm Bhava and yuti 
with either Śukr, or Putr‟s Lord, the native will obtain royal status. 
40. Two and a half Ghatis from mid-day, or from mid-night is auspicious 
time. A birth during such an auspicious time will cause one to be a king, or 
equal to him. 41. Should Candr and Śukr be mutually in Sahaj and Labh Bhava and 
receiving Drishtis from each other, while they are placed elsewhere, a Raj 
Yog is obtained. 
42. Should Candr, endowed with strength, be Vargottāńś and receives a 
Drishti from four, or more Grahas, the native will become a king. 
43. One will become a king, if Lagn in Uttamāńś receives a Drishti from 
four, or more Grahas, out of which Candr should not be one. 
44. If one, or two, or three Grahas are in exaltation, one of a royal scion will 
become a king, while another will be equal to a king, or be wealthy. 
45. If four, or five Grahas occupy their exaltation Rāśis, or Mooltrikon 
Rāśis, even a person of base birth will become king. 
46. If six Grahas are exalted, the native will become emperor and will enjoy 
various kinds of royal paraphernalia. 
47. Even, if one among Guru, Śukr and Budh is in exaltation, while a 
benefic is in a Kendr, the native will become a king, or be equal to him. 
48. If all benefics are relegated to Kendras, while malefics are in Sahaj, Ari 
and Labh Bhava, the native, though may be of mean descent, will ascend 
the throne. 
Ch. 40. Yogas For Royal Association 
1. If Karm‟s Lord is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from the dispositor of 
Amatya Karak, or even, if Karm‟s Lord is yuti with, or receives a Drishti 
from Amatya Karak himself, the native will be a chief in the king‟s court. 
2. If Karm and Labh Bhava are devoid of malefic occupation and devoid of 
Drishti from a malefic, while Labh Bhava receives a Drishti from its own 
Lord, the native will be a chief in the king‟s court. 
3. Should Amatya Karak and the dispositor of Atma Karak be together, the 
native will be endowed with great intelligence and will be a king‟s minister. 
(„Karakendr‟ is interpreted here, as the dispositor of Atma Karak. Similarly 
„Amatyesa‟ means the dispositor of Amatya Karak) 4. If Atma Karak is strong and is with a benefic, or Amatya Karak is in its 
own Bhava, or in exaltation, one will surely become a king‟s minister. 
5. There is no doubt in one‟s becoming a king‟s minister and famous, if 
Atma Karak is in Tanu, or Putr, or Dharm Bhava. 
6. If Atma Karak, or Amatya Karak is placed in a Kendr, or in a Kon, the 
native will beget royal mercy, royal patronage and happiness thereof. 
7. Should malefics be in the 3rd and the 6th from Atma Karak, or from Arudh 
Lagn, or in Sahaj and Ari Bhava, one will become Army chief. 
8. If Atma Karak is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, or in exaltation, or in its own 
Bhava and gives a Drishti to Dharm‟s Lord, the native will be a king‟s 
minister. 
9. If the Lord of the Rāśi, where Candr is placed becomes Atma Karak and, 
if this Lord is placed in Tanu Bhava along with a benefic, the native will 
become a king‟s minister at his advanced age. 
10. Should the Atma Karak be in Putr, Yuvati, Karm, or Dharm Bhava and 
happen to be with a benefic, one will earn wealth through royal patronage. 
11. If the Arudh of Dharm Bhava happens to be itself the Janm Lagn, or, if 
Atma Karak is placed in Dharm Bhava, the native will be associated with 
royal circles. 
12. One will gain through royal association, if Labh Bhava is occupied by its 
own Lord and is devoid of a Drishti from a malefic. The Atma Karak should 
at the same time be yuti with a benefic. 
13. An exchange of Rāśis between Karm‟s Lord and Lagn‟s Lord will make 
the native associated with the king in a great manner. 
14. If Śukr and Candr are in the 4th from Karakāńś Lagn, the native will be 
endowed with royal insignia. 
15. Should Lagn‟s Lord, or the Atma Karak be yuti with Putr‟s Lord and be 
in a Kendr, or in a Kon, the native will be a king, or minister. 
Ch. 41. Combinations for Wealth 1. I now tell you of special combinations, giving wealth. One born to these 
Yogas will surely become wealthy. 
2. Yogas for Great Affluence (up to Sloka 8). Should a Rāśi of Śukr be Putr 
Bhava and be occupied by Śukr himself, while Mangal is in Labh Bhava, 
the native will obtain great riches. 
3. Should a Rāśi of Budh be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Budh himself, 
as Labh Bhava is occupied by Candr, Mangal and Guru, the native will be 
very affluent. 
4. Should Simh be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Sūrya himself, as Śani, 
Candr and Guru are in Labh Bhava, the native will be very affluent. 
5. Should Sūrya and Candr be in Labh Bhava, as Śani is in Putr Bhava 
identical with his own Bhava, the native will be very affluent. 
6. Should Guru be in Putr Bhava identical with his own Rāśi, as Budh is in 
Labh Bhava, the native will be very affluent. 
7. If a Rāśi of Mangal happens to be Putr Bhava with Mangal therein, while 
Śukr is in Labh Bhava, the native will become very affluent. 
8. If Kark happens to be Putr Bhava, containing Candr therein, while Śani is 
in Labh Bhava, the native will become very affluent. 
9. Yogas for Wealth (up to Sloka 15). Should Sūrya be in Simh identical 
with Lagn and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from Mangal and Guru, 
one will be wealthy. 
10. Should Candr be in Kark identical with Lagn and be yuti with, or 
receiving a Drishti from Budh and Guru, one will be wealthy. 
11. Should Mangal be in Lagn identical with his own Rāśi and be yuti with, 
or receiving a Drishti from Budh, Śukr and Śani, the native will be rich. 
12. Should Budh‟s Rāśi be Lagn with Budh therein and should Budh be yuti 
with, or receiving a Drishti from Śani and Guru, the native will be rich. 
13. Should Guru be in Lagn identical with his own Rāśi and be yuti with, or 
receiving a Drishti from Budh and Mangal, the native will be rich. 14. If Śukr happens to be in Lagn identical with his own Rāśi and be yuti 
with, or receiving a Drishti from Śani and Budh, one will be wealthy. 
15. If Śani is in his own Rāśi identical with Lagn and receiving a Drishti 
from, or being yuti with Mangal and Guru, the native will be wealthy. 
16. Other Qualified Grahas. Dharm‟s Lord and Putr‟s Lord are capable of 
bestowing wealth. Similarly Grahas, yuti with Dharm‟s Lord and/or Putr‟s 
Lord are capable of bestowing wealth. There is no doubt, that these Grahas 
will give wealth during their Dasha periods. 
17. The Yogas, mentioned above (up to Sloka 16) should be delineated 
after knowing favourable, or unfavourable dispositions of the participant 
Grahas and their strength and weakness. 
18-19. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of the Lords of Kendras. If the Lord 
of a Kendr is in Parijatāńś, the native will be liberal, if in Uttamāńś, will be 
highly liberal, if in Gopurāńś, will be endowed with prowess, if in 
Simhasanāńś, will be honourable, if in Paravatāńś, will be valorous, if in 
Devalokāńś, will be head of an assembly, if in Brahmalokāńś, will be a 
sage and, if in Iravatāńś, will be delighted and be celebrated in all quarters. 
20-22. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Putr‟s Lord. If Putr‟s Lord is in 
Parijatāńś, the native will take to the branch of learning, befitting his race, if 
in Uttamāńś, will have excellent learning, if in Gopurāńś, will receive world-
wide honours, if in Simhasanāńś, will become a minister, if in also 
Paravatāńś, will be endowed with Vedic Knowledge, if in Devalokāńś, will 
be a Karm Yogi (performer of actions, worldly and religious rites), if in 
Brahmalokāńś, will be devoted to the Lord and, if in Iravatāńś, will be pious. 
23-27. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Dharm‟s Lord. If Dharm‟s Lord is 
in Parijatāńś, the native will visit holy places, if in Uttamāńś, has been 
visiting holy places in the past births and he will do the same within this life-
time, if in Gopurāńś, will perform sacrificial rites, if in Simhasanāńś, will be 
mighty and truthful, conquerer of his senses and will concentrate only on 
the Brahman, giving up all religions, if in Paravatāńś, will be the greatest of 
ascetics, if in Devalokāńś, will be an ascetic, holding a cudgel (Lagudi), or 
he will be a religious mendicant, that has renounced all mundane 
attachments and carrying three long staves, tied together, in his right hand 
(Tridandin) and, if in Brahmalokāńś, will perform Aswamedh Yagya (Horse Sacrifice) and will attain the state of Lord Indra, if in Iravatāńś, will be a 
synonym of Dharma, or virtues just, as Lord Ram and Yudhishtira. 
28. Lords of Kendras and Konas Related. The Kendras are known, as 
Vishnu Sthanas (Bhavas of Lord Vishnu), while the Konas are called 
Lakshmi Sthanas. If the Lord of a Kendr establishes a relationship with the 
Lord of a Kon, a Raj Yog is obtained. 
(A sixth kind of relationship can also be extended in this context to Navāńś 
positions, though there is no specific classic sanction for this. For example 
in the case of a Makar native Mangal in the Navāńś of Śukr and Śukr in the 
Navāńś of Mangal will confer a superior Raj Yog. This form of relationship 
will be equally superior, like the first 3 relationships, mentioned in the 
earlier paragraph). 
29-34 Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Related Lords of Kendras and 
Lords of Konas. If the Lord of a Kendr and the Lord of a Kon, having a 
relationship, as indicated in Sloka 28, happen to be in Parijatāńś, the native 
will be king and will protect men, if in Uttamāńś, will be an excellent king, 
endowed with elephants, horses, chariots etc., if in Gopurāńś, will be a tiger 
of kings, honoured by other kings and, if in Simhasanāńś, will be an 
emperor, ruling over the entire earth. With the said Raj Yog relationship of 
the said Grahas in Simhasanāńś were born Harish Candr, Manu, Bali, Agni 
Deva and many emperors. In the present Yuga so born is Yudhishtira 
(Dharm Raj of Mahabharat). Salivahana‟s birth and that of others will also 
come with this Yog. With such Lords, placed in Paravatāńś, Manu etc. were 
born. The Incarnations of Lord Vishnu took place, when such Lords were 
placed in Devalokāńś. With such Lords, placed in Brahmalokāńś, Lord 
Brahma was born and, placed in Iravatāńś, the Swayambhu Manu was 
born. (Manu is the first of the 14 Manus, identified, as the second creator, 
who produced the Prajapatis. To Manu the code of laws, Manu Smriti is 
ascribed). 
Ch. 42. Combinations for Penury 
1. O Lord, you have stated many Yogas, related to acquisition of wealth. 
Please tell me such Yogas, causing utter poverty. 2. The native will be penniless, if Lagn‟s Lord is in Vyaya Bhava, while 
Vyaya‟s Lord is in Lagn along with the Lord of a Marak, or receives a 
Drishti from such a Gr ah. 
3. The native will be penniless, if Lagn‟s Lord is in Ari Bhava, while Ari‟s 
Lord is in Lagn, yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from a Marak Lord. 
4. Should Lagn, or Candr be with Ketu, while Lagn‟s Lord is in Randhr 
Bhava, the person concerned will be penniless. 
5. If Lagn‟s Lord along with a malefic is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, 
while Dhan‟s Lord is in an enemy‟s Rāśi, or in debilitation, even a native of 
royal scion will become penniless. 
6. If Lagn‟s Lord is yuti with the Lord of Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or 
with Śani and, if Lagn‟s Lord is devoid of a Drishti from a benefic, the native 
will be penniless. 
7. Should Putr‟s and Dharm‟s Lords be, respectively, found in Ari and 
Vyaya Bhava and receive a Drishti from Marak Grahas, the native will be 
penniless.  
8. If malefics, excepting the Lords of Karm and Dharm Bhava, happen to be 
in Lagn, associated with, or receiving a Drishti from Marak Grahas, one will 
become penniless. 
9. Note the Grahas, that are ruling the Rāśis, occupied by the Lords of Ari, 
Randhr and Vyaya Bhava. If the said dispositors are in such evil Bhavas in 
turn and are associated with, or receive a Drishti from malefics, the native 
will be miserable and indigent. 
10. The Lord of the Navāńś, occupied by Candr, joining a Marak Grah, or 
occupying a Marak Bhava, will make one penniless. 
11. Should the Lord of the natal Lagn and that of the Navāńś Lagn be yuti 
with, or receive a Drishti from Marak Grahas, one will be penniless. 
12. If inauspicious Bhavas are occupied by benefics, while auspicious 
Bhavas are occupied by malefics, the native will be indigent and will be 
distressed even in the matter of food. 13. A Grah, associated with one of the Lords of Ari, Randhr and Vyaya 
Bhava, being bereft of a Drishti from the Lord of a Kon, will in its Dasha 
periods cause harm to the native‟s financial aspects. 
14. If the 8th/12th from Atma Karak, or Randhr/Vyaya Bhava receive a 
Drishti from the Atma Karak‟s Navāńś Lord and the Lord of Janma Lagn, 
the native will be bereft of wealth. 
15. The native will be a spendthrift, if the 12th from Atma Karak receives a 
Drishti from the dispositor of Atma Karak, or, if Vyaya Bhava receives a 
Drishti from the Lord of Lagn. 
16-18. Now I tell you some Yogas for poverty along with conditions of their 
nullifications. Should Mangal and Śani be together in Dhan Bhava, the 
native‟s wealth will be destroyed. Should Budh give a Drishti to Mangal and 
Śani in Dhan Bhava, there will be great wealth. There is no doubt in it. 
Sūrya in Dhan Bhava, receiving a Drishti from Śani, will cause penury, 
while, if Sūrya is in Dhan Bhava and does not receive a Drishti from Śani, 
riches and fame will be obtained. The same effects (poverty) will be 
declared, if Śani is in Dhan Bhava, receiving a Drishti from Sūrya. 
Ch. 43. Longevity 
1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have dealt with combinations for wealth and 
poverty. Kindly detail methods of ascertaining the life-span of human 
beings. 
2-3. O Brahmin, for the benefit of mankind I narrate methods of 
ascertaining longevity. Knowing that longevity is difficult even for gods. 
Many exponents have laid down various methods of longevity calculations. 
Following is the summary of such schools of thought. 
4-8. Pindayu. The Grahas contribute to longevity, according to their being 
in exaltation, or debilitation and also based on their strengths and 
weaknesses and positions in Ashvini etc. and in the various Rāśis. First of 
all Pindayu is based on the positions of the Grahas. O Brahmin, listen 
carefully to what I say: 19, 25, 15, 12, 15, 21 and 20 are the number of 
years, contributed by the Grahas, from Sūrya etc., when in exaltation. 
These are half of the above in debilitation. And, if the Grahas are in 
between exaltation and debilitation, the rule of three process should be used. Deduct the actual position of the Grah from its deep exaltation point. 
If the product is less than 6 Rāśis, deduct it again from 12 Rāśis. The 
product concerned should be multiplied by the number of years allotted to 
the Grah and divided by 12 to get the Grah‟s actual contribution. 
9. Rectifications. Excepting Śukr and Śani, the contributions, made by 
others, should be halved, if they are eclipsed by Sūrya. One third should be 
reduced, if the Grah is in its inimical Rāśi. This does not apply to the one in 
retrogression (see Vakra Charam). 
10-11. Deductions for Grahas in the Visible Half of the Zodiac. Full, half, 
one third, one fourth, one fifth and one sixth are the deductions of 
contributions, made by malefics, placed in the visible half of the zodiac. 
Benefics in such cases lose only half of what malefics lose. Should there 
be more than one Grah in a Bhava, the deduction, due to the strongest, will 
only prevail and not deductions, due to other Grahas in that particular 
Bhava. Waning Candr is a benefic for this purpose. 
12-13. Malefics in Lagn. In case Tanu Bhava is occupied by malefics, adopt 
the following procedure. Convert Lagn‟s Sphuta into minutes of arc and 
multiply it by the years etc., contributed by the occupant, and divide by 
21600. The years etc. so arrived be deducted from the respective 
contribution, which will be the net span, donated by the Grah. If there is 
benefic‟s Drishti on Lagn, containing malefics, then the loss is only half. 
14-15. Lagn‟s Contribution. The number of years, contributed by Lagn, will 
correspond to the number of Rāśis it gained (from Mesh), while the 
degrees Lagn has gained in the particular Rāśi will also correspondingly 
donate (30° = l year). If the Lagn‟s Lord in the Navāńś is stronger than 
Lagn‟s Lord, then the contribution should be computed only based on the 
number of Navāńśas gained (from Mesh), otherwise the computation will 
be for the Rāśi Lagn. 
16-17. Nisargayu. O Brahmin, now I tell you about Nisargayu. 1, 2, 9, 20, 
18, 20 and 50 are the years, allotted to Candr, Mangal, Budh, Śukr, Guru, 
Sūrya and Śani from the period of birth. 
18-19. Ańśayu. Now I will tell you about Ańśayu contributions by Lagn and 
Grahas. The years correspond to the number of Navāńśas, counted from 
Mesh. Multiply the longitude in question by 108. If the product exceeds 12, expunge multiples of 12 and consider the final product in Rāśis, degrees 
etc., as years, months etc. 
20-22. The same reductions, as per Pindayu, apply to Ańśayu as well; i.e. 
half for a combust Grah, one third for inimical placement and the ones, due 
for placements in the half of the zodiac, counted from the 12th backwards. 
Some scholars suggest further corrections for Ańśayu, viz. to increase 
threefold the contribution of a Grah in exaltation, or in own Bhava and 
double the contribution, if the contributor is in his own Navāńś, or in his own 
Dreshkan. If doubling and trebling is warranted, only trebling be done. In 
case of reductions also only halving is to be done, if both halving and 
reducing a third are required. That is how the final life-span of men be 
understood. 
23. Longevity for Other Living Beings. For other living beings as well such 
computations can be made. The said figure should be multiplied by the 
figure, corresponding to its full span of life and divided by the figure, 
corresponding to the full span of life for human beings. 
24-29. Full Life Span of Various Living Beings. Now I‟ll tell you about the 
full life-span figures for various living beings. Gods and sages enjoy 
endless life-span (in astronomical proportions, as against ordinary mortals). 
The full life-span of eagles, owls, parrots, crows and snakes is one 
thousand years. For falcon, monkey, bear and frog the full span of life is 
300 years. Demon‟s full life-span is 150 years, while it is 120 for human 
beings, 32 for horses, 25 for donkeys and camels, 24 for oxen and 
buffaloes, 20 for peacocks, 16 for goats and rams. 14 for swans, 12 for 
cuckoo, dog and dove, 8 for hens etc. and 7 for birds etc. 
30-31. Choice of Longevity. I have narrated 3 different methods of 
longevity. Listen to me about the choice among the three systems. 
According to which of the three, Lagn, Sūrya, or Candr is stronger than the 
other two, Ańśayu, Pindayu, or Nisargayu should be, respectively, chosen. 
32. Doubtful Cases. If two among Lagn, Sūrya and Candr gain equal 
strength, then longevity should be worked out, as per both systems and the 
average of both should be considered. If all the three are equally strong, 
the average of the three should be considered. 
33-40. Other Clues to Longevity. O excellent of the Brahmins, I will now 
give you details of other methods in the matter of longevity, as under. This is based on the positions of Lagn‟s Lord, Randhr‟s Lord, Śani, Candr, natal 
Lagn and Hora Lagn. These six are grouped into three groups thus: the 
Lords of Lagn and of Randhr Bhava on the one hand, Śani and Candr on 
the other hand and the natal Lagn and Hora Lagn on yet the other hand. 
Out of a group of two, if the two are in Movable Rāśis, long life is denoted. 
One in a Fixed Rāśi and the other in a Dual Rāśi will also bestow long life. 
One in a Movable Rāśi and the other in a Fixed Rāśi will give medium life. 
If both are in Dual Rāśis, then again medium life will be obtained. Short life 
is denoted, if one is in a Movable Rāśi, as the other is in a Dual Rāśi, or, if 
both are in Fixed Rāśis. The type of life, denoted by three, or two groups be 
only considered. If the three groups denote different scales, then the one, 
indicated by the pair of natal Lagn and Hora Lagn should be only 
considered. In case of three different indications, if Candr is in Lagn, or 
Yuvati Bhava, then the one, indicated by the Śani-Candr pair will only come 
to pass. 
41-44. Further Clarifications. If long life is denoted by all the said three 
groups, the span is 120 years, if by two groups, it is 108 years and, if only 
by one group it is 91 years. If medium life is arrived at by three groups, it is 
80 years, if indicated by 2 groups, it is 72 years and, if by one group, it is 64 
years. If short life is denoted by the said three groups, it is only 32 years, if 
indicated by two groups, the life-span is 36 years and, if by one group, the 
life-span is 40 years. These are rectified, as under. 
45-46. Rectifications. If the contributor is in the beginning of a Rāśi, his 
donation will be full and it will be nil, if he is at the end of a Rāśi. For 
intermediary placements rule of three process will apply. Add the 
longitudes of the contributors and the sum so arrived at must be divided by 
the number of contributors. The latest product should be multiplied by the 
number of basic years and divided by 30. This will yield the net longevity. 
47. Special Rule for Śani. Should Śani be a contributor, the class of 
longevity declines. Some advocate contrarily an increase of class in this 
context. If Śani is in its own Rāśi, or in exaltation, change in class will not 
occur. Even, if he receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with only a malefic, no 
change occurs. 
48. Special Rule for Guru. If Guru is in Lagn, or in Yuvati Bhava and 
receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with only benefics, the class of longevity 
will increase. 49-50. Increase and Fall in Class of Longevity. From very short life to short 
life, from short life to medium life, from medium life to long life and from 
long life to extremely long life are the increases in the classification of 
longevity, when Guru warrants an increase. The reverse is true, if Śani 
warrants a fall in the span of life. 
51. (Maitreya says) You have narrated various kinds of longevity 
computations. Please favour me by denoting subtle classes thereof and 
poor and long life-spans. 
52. (Maharishi Parashar replies) These are seven-fold, viz. Bal Risht, Yog 
Risht, short, medium, long, sup er-natural (Divya) and immortality 
(Amritayu). 
53-54. The life-span in Bal Risht is 8 years, in Yog Risht 20 years, in short, 
medium and long lives, respectively, 32, 64 and 120 years. Super-natural 
life-span is 1000 years. Above this super-natural life- span of 1000 years it 
is Amritayu, which can be acquired only by those, who deserve it. 
55. Limitless Longevity. Should Kark be Lagn with Guru and Candr therein, 
while Śukr and Budh are in Kendras and others are in Sahaj, Ari and Labh 
Bhava, the native will obtain limitless longevity. 
56. Super-Natural Longevity. One having benefics in Kendras and/or 
Konas, while malefics are in Sahaj, Ari and Labh Bhava will obtain super-
natural life-span. Randhr Bhava in this case should be one of the Rāśis, 
owned by a benefic. 
57. Living until the End of the Yuga. One born in Kark Lagn will live till the 
end of the Yuga, if Guru is in a Kendr and happens to be in Gopurāńś, 
while Śukr is in a Kon and happens to be in Paravatāńś. 
58. Living the Life-Span of a Sage. Guru in Simhasanāńś, being in Lagn, 
Śani in Devalokāńś and Mangal in Paravatāńś. If these are so, one will 
enjoy the life-span, as due to a sage. 
59. Good Yogas increase the life-span and bad Yogas decrease the same. 
Hence I tell you such Yogas, as to know of full, medium and short span 
combinations. 60. If a Kendr contains a benefic, while Lagn‟s Lord is yuti with, or receives 
a Drishti from a benefic, or Guru in particular, the native will live a full span 
of life. 
61. Should Lagn‟s Lord be in a Kendr yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from 
Guru and Śukr, full life-span will result. 
62. If at birth three Grahas are exalted, out of which the Lords of Lagn and 
Randhr Bhava are inclusive, as Randhr Bhava is devoid of a malefic in it, 
full life-span will result. 
63. Long life is denoted, if three Grahas are in Randhr Bhava, in exaltation, 
own, or friendly divisions, while Lagn‟s Lord is strong. 
64. If Śani, or Lagn‟s Lord is yuti with any exalted Grah, long life will result. 
65. Long life will be enjoyed, if malefics are in Sahaj, Ari and Labh Bhava, 
while benefics are in Kendras. 
66. If Ari, Yuvati and Randhr Bhava are occupied by benefics, while 
malefics are in Sahaj and Labh Bhava, full life-span will follow the birth. 
67. If Randhr‟s Lord is friendly to Sūrya, while malefics are in Ari and Vyaya 
Bhava, as Lagn‟s Lord is in a Kendr, the native will live the full span of life. 
68. O excellent of the Brahmins, if a malefic is in Randhr Bhava, while 
Karm‟s Lord is exalted, one will be long-lived. 
69. Long life will follow, if Lagn is a Dual Rāśi, while Lagn‟s Lord is in a 
Kendr, or in exaltation, or in a Kon. 
70. Should Lagn be a Dual Rāśi, while two malefics are in a Kendr with 
reference to a strong Lagn‟s Lord, long life is indicated. 
71-73. If the stronger among Lagn‟s Lord and Randhr‟s Lord is placed in a 
Kendr, long life is indicated and, if in a Panaphara, medium life is indicated, 
if in Apoklima, short life will come to pass. According to Lagn‟s Lord being 
friendly, neutral, or inimical to Sūrya, long, medium, or short life will result. 74. Should Mangal and Sahaj‟s Lord, or Randhr‟s Lord and Śani be 
combust, or be yuti with malefics, or receive a Drishti from malefics, there 
will be short life. 
75. If Lagn‟s Lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, yuti with malefics an d 
devoid of Yuti with and/or Drishti from a benefic, short life will come to 
pass. 
76. If malefics are in Kendras, devoid of Yuti with, or a Drishti from 
benefics, while Lagn‟s Lord is not strong, only short life will result. 
77. O excellent of Brahmins, if Vyaya and Dhan Bhava are occupied by 
malefics and devoid of a Drishti from a benefic, or of Yuti with a benefic, the 
native will be short-lived. 
78. If the Lords of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are bereft of dignities and 
strength, short life will come to pass. If the Lords of Lagn and Randhr 
Bhava are helped by others, while being so, medium life-span will come to 
pass. 
Ch. 44. Marak Grahas 
1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have mentioned a lot about longevity. Be 
kind enough to throw light on Marakas, or killers. 
2-5. O Brahmin, Sahaj and Randhr Bhava are the two Bhavas of longevity. 
The Bhavas, related to death, are the 12th from each of these, i.e. Dhan 
and Yuvati Bhava are Marak Bhavas. 
3. Out of the two, Dhan Bhava is a powerful Marak Bhava. The Lords of 
Dhan and Yuvati Bhava, malefics in Dhan and Yuvati Bhava and malefics, 
yuti with Dhan‟s Lord and yuti with Yuvati‟s Lord are all known, as Marakas. 
The major and sub-periods of these Grahas will bring death on the native, 
depending on whether he is a long life, medium life, or short life person. 
6-7. The Dasha of a benefic Grah, related to Vyaya‟s Lord may also inflict 
death. End may descend on the native in Randhr‟s Lord‟s Dasha. The 
Dasha of a Grah, which is an exclusive malefic, may also cause death. 
9. Should Śani be ill-disposed and be related to a Marak Grah, he will be 
the first to kill in preference to other Grahas. 10-14. O Brahmin, I tell you further about Marakas. Narrated earlier are 
three kinds of life-spans, viz. short, medium and long. Short life is before 32 
years, later on up to 64 it is medium life and from 64 to 100 it is long life. 
Beyond 100 the longevity is called supreme. O excellent of the Brahmins, it 
is impossible to decide upon longevity till the native is 20 years old. Till 
such year the child should be protected by sacred recitations, religious 
offerings (of Ghī etc.) to consecrated fire, as prescribed in the Vedas etc. 
and through medical treatments, for premature death may descend on the 
child due to sins of father and mother, or of its own (in the previous birth). 
15-21. I further mention about the Marak Grahas. One born with short life 
combinations may face death in the Dasha, denoted by Vipat star (3rd from 
the birth star), one of medium life may die in the Dasha, denoted by 
Pratyak star (5th from the birth star). In the Dasha, denoted by Vadh star 
(7th from the birth star), one with long life may obtain his end. The Dasha of 
the Lord of the 22nd Dreshkan, or 23rd, or 3rd, or 5th, or 7th asterisms may 
also cause death. The Lords of the 2nd and the 12th, counted from Kark, 
may bring death. This is true, when Candr is a malefic. If he happens to be 
a benefic, there will be diseases (not death). Death may come to pass in 
the Dasha of Ari‟s Lord and in the subperiods of Ari‟s, Randhr‟s and/or 
Vyaya‟s Lords. Should there be many Marakas and, if these Marakas are 
strong, there will be diseases, miseries etc. in major and sub-periods. Thus 
these are Marakas and are primarily related to bring death upon the native. 
According to their dispositions there may be death, or difficulties. 
22-24. Rahu and Ketu, as Marakas. If Rahu, or Ketu are placed in Tanu, 
Yuvati, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or happen to be in the 7th from a Marak 
Lord, or are placed with such a Grah, they acquire powers of killing in their 
major, or sub-periods. For one born in Makar, or in Vrischik, Rahu will be a 
Marak. Should Rahu be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, he will give 
difficulties in his Dasha periods. He will not, however, do so, if Rahu 
receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic. 
25-31. Sahaj Bhava and Death. O excellent of Brahmins, if Sūrya, being 
with strength, is in Sahaj Bhava, one will obtain his death, due to a king 
(legal punishments). Candr in Sahaj Bhava will cause death, due to 
tuberculosis, while wounds, weapons, fire and thirst will cause death 
through Mangal in Sahaj Bhava. If Sahaj Bhava receives a Drishti from, or 
is occupied by Śani and Rahu, death will be through poison, water, or fire, 
or fall from heights, or confinement. Death will surely come to descend through insects, or leprosy, if Candr and Gulik occupy, or give a Drishti to 
Sahaj Bhava. Budh, giving a Drishti to, or occupying Sahaj Bhava, will bring 
death, followed by fever. Guru in Sahaj Bhava, or giving a Drishti to Sahaj 
Bhava, will cause death by swelling, or tumours. Urinary diseases will 
cause death, if Śukr is in, or gives a Drishti to Sahaj Bhava. Many Grahas, 
giving a Drishti to, or occupying Sahaj Bhava, will bring death through 
many diseases. 
32. If Sahaj Bhava is occupied by a benefic, death will be in an auspicious 
place (like a shrine) and, if Sahaj Bhava is occupied by a malefic, death will 
be in sinful places. Mixed occupation of Sahaj Bhava will yield mixed 
results with regard to the place of death. 
33. Consciousness will prevail at the time of death, if Guru, or Śukr are 
placed in Sahaj Bhava. With other Grahas in Sahaj Bhava there will be 
unconsciousness before death. 
34. According to Sahaj Bhava being a Movable, a Fixed, or a Dual Rāśi, 
death will be, respectively, in a foreign place (other than native birth place), 
in one‟s own house, or on the way. 
35-36. Occupants of Randhr Bhava. Note the occupant of Randhr Bhava. If 
it is Sūrya, death will be through fire, if Candr is in Randhr Bhava, through 
water, if Mangal, through weapons, if Budh, through fever, if Guru, through 
diseases, if Śukr, through hunger and, if Śani, through thirst. 
37. If Randhr Bhava is occupied by, or receives a Drishti from a benefic, 
while Dharm‟s Lord is yuti with a benefic, the native will die in a shrine. If 
Randhr Bhava is occupied by, or receives a Drishti from a malefic, while 
Dharm‟s Lord is yuti with a malefic, death will be in a place, other than a 
shrine. 
38-39. Fate of the Human Physical System. Should there be a benefic‟s 
Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava (22nd Dreshkan), the body will be burnt in fire 
(as prescribed in Shastras). If a malefic‟s Dreshkan happens to be in 
Randhr Bhava, the body will be thrown away in water. If the Dreshkan in 
Randhr Bhava is owned by a mixed Grah, the dead body will only dry up. If 
the Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava is a serpent Dreshkan, the body will be 
eaten away by animals, crows etc. 40. Serpent Dreshkanas. The 2nd and 3rd Dreshkan in Kark, the initial one in 
Vrischik and the last one in Meen are designated, as serpent Dreshkanas. 
41-42. Pre-natal Abode. O excellent of Brahmins, the stronger of the two 
luminaries, Sūrya and Candr, occupying a Dreshkan of Guru, denotes the 
descent from the world of gods. If the stronger of the luminaries occupies 
the Dreshkan of Śukr, or Candr, the descent is from the world of the 
Manes, if the stronger of the two luminaries is in the Dreshkan of Sūrya, or 
Mangal, the descent is from the world of Yama (world of the death) and, if 
in Dreshkan of Budh, or Śani, the descent is from the hell. 
43-45. Ascent after Death. According to the following Grahas in Vyaya, 
Yuvati, Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will attain one of the different 
worlds after death: Guru heaven, Candr, or Śukr the world of Manes, 
Mangal and/or Sūrya earth (rebirth), Budh and/or Śani hell. In case the said 
Bhavas are not occupied, the native will go to the world, indicated by the 
stronger of the Dreshkan Lords, related to Ari and Randhr Bhava. The 
relative Grah‟s exaltation etc. will denote the high, medium and low status 
the native will obtain in the said world. 
46. Other Grahas and Rāśis, becoming Marakas, are being discussed in 
the chapter, related to Dashas. 
Ch. 45. Avasthas of Grahas 
1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have earlier stated, that the Avasthas, or 
states of the Grahas are to be considered in the context of the effects of the 
Grahas. Be so kind to tell me about this. 
2. O excellent of Brahmins, various kinds of Avasthas of the Grahas have 
been expounded. Out of these, I will give you the summary of Baal (infant) 
and other states of the Grahas. 
3. Baal, Kumar, Yuv, Vriddh and Mrit Avastha (Baal Adi Avasthas). Infant, 
youthful, adolescent, old and dead are the states of the Grahas, placed in 
the ascending order at the rate of six degrees in odd Rāśis. In the case of 
even Rāśis this arrangement is in reverse order. (Vriddh - Advanced, Mrit - 
In extremis) 4. Results. One fourth, half, full, negligible and nil are the grades of the 
results, due to a Grah in infant, youthful, adolescent, old and dead 
Avasthas. 
5. Awakening, Dreaming and Sleeping States. If a Grah is in its own Rāśi, 
or in exaltation, it is said to be in a state of awakening (alertness). In the 
Rāśi of a friend, or of a neutral it is in dreaming state, while in an enemy‟s 
Rāśi, or in debilitation it is in a state of sleeping. 
6. According to a Grah, being in Awakening, Dreaming, or Sleeping states, 
the results, due to it will be full, medium, or nil. 
7. Other Kinds of States. There are nine kinds of other Avasthas, viz. Dipt, 
Swasth, Pramudit, Shanta, Din, Vikal, Duhkhit, Khal and Kop. 
8-10. If a Grah is in its exaltation Rāśi, it is in Dipt Avastha, if in its own 
Rāśi, it is in Swasth, if in a great friend‟s Rāśi, it is in Pramudit, if in a 
friendly Rāśi, it is in Shanta, if in a neutral Rāśi, it is in Din, if a Grah is yuti 
with a malefic, it is in Vikal, if is in an enemy‟s Rāśi, it is in Duhkhit, if in a 
great enemy‟s Rāśi, it is in Khal and, if a Grah is being eclipsed by Sūrya, it 
is in Kop. Depending on such a state of the Grah, the Bhava, occupied by it 
will obtain corresponding effects. 
11-18. Yet other Avasthas. Lajjit, Garvit, Kshudhit, Trushit, Mudit and 
Kshobhit are the other kinds of Avasthas, due to the Grahas. Placed in Putr 
Bhava, if a Grah is associated with Rahu, or Ketu, or with Sūrya, Śani, or 
Mangal, it is in Lajjit Avastha. If a Grah is in exaltation, or in Mooltrikon, it is 
Garvit. If a Grah is in an enemy‟s Rāśi, or yuti with an enemy, or receives a 
Drishti from an enemy, or even, if a Grah is yuti with Śani, the Avastha is 
Kshudhit. If a Grah is in a watery Rāśi and receives a Drishti from a 
malefic, but does not receive a Drishti from a benefic, the Avastha is called 
Trushit. If a Grah is in a friendly Rāśi, or is yuti with, or receives a Drishti 
from a benefic, or is yuti with Guru, it is said to be in Mudit Avastha. If a 
Grah is yuti with Sūrya and receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a malefic, 
or receives a Drishti from an enemy, it is said to be in Kshobhit. The 
Bhavas, occupied by a Grah in Kshudhit, or in Kshobhit, are destroyed. 
19-23. The learned should estimate the effects, due to a Bhava, in the 
manner, cited above, after ascertaining the strength and weakness. Weak 
Grahas cause reduction in good effects, while stronger ones give greater 
effects. If a Grah, posited in Karm Bhava, is in Lajjit, Kshudhit Avastha, or Kshobhit Avastha, the person will always be subjected to miseries. If a 
Grah in Putr is in Lajjit, there will be destruction of progeny, or there will be 
only one surviving child. Surely the wife of the native will die, if there is a 
Grah in Yuvati in Kshobhit, or in Trushit Avastha. 
24-29. Effects of Garvit, Mudit, Lajjit, Kshobhit, Kshudhit and Trushit 
Avastha. A Grah in Garvit Avastha will cause happiness through new 
houses and gardens, regalhood, skill in arts, financial gains at all times and 
improvement in business. A Grah in Mudit Avastha will give residences, 
clothes, ornaments, happiness from lands and wife, happiness from 
relatives, living in royal places, destruction of enemies and acquisition of 
wisdom and learning. A Grah in Lajjit will give aversion to God, loss of 
intelligence, loss of child, interest in evil speeches and listlessness in good 
things. A Grah in Kshobhit will give acute penury, evil disposition, miseries, 
financial debacles, distress to feet and obstruction to income, due to royal 
wrath. A Grah in Kshudhit will cause downfall, due to grief and passion, 
grief on account of relatives, physical decline, troubles from enemies, 
financial distress, loss of physical strength and an eclipsed mind, due to 
miseries. A Grah in Trushit Avastha will cause diseases through 
association with females, leading over wicked deeds, loss of wealth, due to 
one‟s own men, physical weakness, miseries, caused by evil people and 
decline of honour. 
30-37. Calculation of Shayan Adi Avasthas. Now I will tell you of the 
Avasthas, viz. Shayan, Upavesan, Netrapani, Prakash, Gaman, Agaman, 
Sabh, Agam, Bhojan, Nritya Lips, Kautuk and Nidr and the Chesthas of 
such Avasthas. Note the number of the star, occupied by the Grah, for 
which an Avastha is to be calculated. Multiply that number by the number, 
denoted by the Grah (Sūrya 1 to Śani 7). The figure so arrived at should 
again be multiplied by the number of the Navāńś, where the Grah is in. Add 
to this the number of the birth asterism (ruling star, the one, occupied by 
Candr), the number of Ghatis of birth and the number of Rāśis, Lagn 
gained from Mesh (Mesh 1, Vrishabh 2 and so forth). This figure should be 
divided by 12 and the remainder will indicate the corresponding Avastha o f 
the Grah. The sub-state in the said Avastha can be found out in the 
following way. Multiply the figure (Sayan 1 to Nidr 12), denoted by the 
Avastha concerned, by the same figure and increase it by the figure, 
denoted by the Anka value for the first syllable of the native‟s personal 
name. Divide the product so obtained by 12. The remainder thereof should 
be further increased by constant additives of the Grahas in the following way: Sūrya 5, Candr 2, Mangal 2, Budh 3, Guru 5, Śukr 3, Śani 3, Rahu 
(Ketu) 4. The product so arrived at should be divided by 3. In the process of 
calculation, if it happens, that the remainder is 1, it is Drishti, if 2, it is 
Chesht and, if 0, it is Vichesht. 
Notes. Shayan Adi are of supreme importance, as compared to the other 
kinds of Avasthas. 
In place of Navāńś, given above, some translators interpret the word Ańś, 
as degree, occupied by the Grah, which is obviously not correct. In this 
connection the reader‟s attention is drawn to Balabhadr‟s Hora Ratna, Ch. 
3, wherein the author, Balabhadr himself, gives an example for Sūrya, 
being in the 7th Navāńś of Simh and thus he considered only 7, as 
multiplier. He quotes Adhibhut Sagara, as his authority for calculation of 
Sayan Adi. 
Agaman Avastha is known, as Gamanechch by some exponents. 
Anka value is 1 for a, ka, cha, ḍ a, dha, bha and va, 2 for i, kha, ja, ḍha, na, 
ma and sha, 3 for u, ga, jha, ta, pa, ya and śa, 4 for e, gha, ṭ a, tha, pha, ra 
and sa, 5 for o, ca, ṭha, da, ba, la and ha. 
38-39. Effects of Chesht etc. If the sub-state is Drishti in an Avastha, the 
results, being stated for the Avastha, will be medium, the effects will be full 
in Chesht and negligible in Vichesht. The good and bad effects of Grahas 
should be deciphered, based on the strength and weakness of the Grahas. 
In exaltation the Grahas reveal effects in a pronounced manner, due to 
Avasthas. 
40-51. Effects of Sūrya‟s Avasthas. If Sūrya is in Sayan Avastha, the native 
will incur digestive deficiency, many diseases, stoutness of legs, bilious 
vitiation, ulcer in the anus and heart strokes; if in Upavesan, will suffer 
poverty, will carry loads, will indulge in litigations, be hard-hearted, wicked 
and will lose in his undertakings; if is in Netrapani, will always be happy, 
wise, helpful to others, endowed with prowess and wealth, very happy and 
will gain royal favours; if in Prakash, will be liberal in disposition, have 
plenty of wealth, be a significant speaker in the assembly, will perform 
many meritorious acts, be greatly strong and endowed with charming 
beauty; if in Gaman, will be disposed to live in foreign places, be miserable, 
indolent, bereft of intelligence and wealth, be distressed, due to fear and 
will be short-tempered; if in Agaman, will be interested in others‟ wives, be devoid of his own men, be interested in movements and skilful in doing evil 
deeds, be dirty, ill-disposed and will be a talebearer; if in Sabh, will be 
disposed to help others, be always endowed with wealth and gems, be 
virtuous, endowed with lands, new houses and robes, be very strong, very 
affectionate to his friends and very kindly disposed; if in Agam, will be 
distressed, due to enemies, fickle-minded, evil-minded, emaciated, devoid 
of virtuous acts and intoxicated with pride; if in Bhojan, will experience 
pains in joints, will lose money on account of others‟ females, will have 
strength, declining off and on, be untruthful, will incur head-aches, eat 
remnant food and will take to bad ways; if in Nritya Lips, will be honoured 
by the learned, be a scholar, will have knowledge of poetry etc. and will be 
adored by kings on the earth; if is Kautuk, will always be happy, will be 
endowed with Vedic Knowledge and will perform Yagyas, will move amidst 
kings, have fear from enemies, will be charming-faced and be endowed 
with knowledge of poetry; if in Nidr, will have a strong tendency towards 
being drowsy, will live in foreign (distant) places, will incur harm to his wife 
and will face financial destruction. Sūrya in Upavesan will make one an 
artisan, black in complexion, devoid of learning and miserable. One will 
serve others. In Netrapani there will be all kinds of happiness, if Sūrya is in 
Putr, Dharm, Karm, or Yuvati. In other Bhavas Netrapani of Sūrya will give 
eye diseases and enmity with all. If Sūrya is in Prakash, the native will be 
meritorious, religious and liberal, will enjoy pleasures, be equal to a prince 
and will enjoy the status of Kuber, the God of wealth. However, the 
Prakash of Sūrya, placed in Yuvati, or Putr will cause loss of the first child 
and will produce many litigations. If Sūrya is in Gaman, the native will incur 
disease of the feet and will be very mean. If in Agaman, Sūrya in Vyaya, or 
in Yuvati will destroy progeny and will give very limited wealth. If in Agam, 
Sūrya will give many miseries, an ugly appearance and foolishness. 
However, he will give wealth. Sūrya in Bhojan in Dharm will cause many 
hindrances to spiritual and religious undertakings. In other Bhavas Sūrya in 
Bhojan will cause head and ear diseases, apart from joint pains. Though 
Maharishi Parashar states, that the native with Sūrya in Kautuk Avastha will 
have fear from enemies, Bal Bhadr exempts such evil effect for the Ari 
Bhava position. Sūrya in Kautuk in other Bhavas will give a number of 
daughters, two wives, itch, excellence, liberality etc. If Sūrya is in Nidr, the 
native will be predisposed to incur piles and elephantiasis, will experience a 
lack of peace and he will be liable to lose his first child. 
52-63. Effects of Candr‟s Avasthas. If Candr is in Sayan, the native will be 
honourable, sluggish, given to sexual lust and he will face financial destruction; if in Upavesan, will be troubled by diseases, be dull-witted, not 
endowed with mentionable wealth, will be hard-hearted, will do unworthy 
acts and will steal others‟ wealth; if in Netrapani, will be troubled by great 
diseases (long lasting in nature), be very garrulous, wicked and will indulge 
in bad deeds. Should Candr be in Prakash, the native will be famous in the 
world, will have his virtues exposed through royal patronage, will be 
surrounded by horses, elephants, females and ornaments, will visit shrines. 
If Candr is in Gaman with decreasing rays, the native will be sinful, cruel 
and always troubled by afflictions of sight. If Candr is in Gaman with 
increasing rays, the native will be distressed, due to fear. If Candr is in 
Agaman, the native will be honourable, will suffer diseases of the feet, will 
secretly indulge in sinful acts, will be poor and devoid of intelligence and 
happiness; if in Sabh, will be eminent among men, honoured by kings and 
kings of kings, will be very beautiful, will subdue the passion of women and 
will be skilful in sexual acts, will be virtuous; if in Agam, will be garrulous 
and virtuous and, if the said Candr is of dark fortnight, the native will have 
two wives, he will be sick, highly wicked and violent; if in Bhojan, will be 
endowed with honour, conveyances, attendants, social status, wife and 
daughters, provided Candr is Full „Purna‟; if in Bhojan and is of dark 
fortnight, auspicious effects will fail to come; if in Nritya Lips and is 
endowed with (fortnightly) strength, will be strong, will have knowledge of 
songs and will be a critic of beauty of things; if in Nritya Lips and of dark 
fortnight, i.e. not endowed with strength, the person will be sinful; if in 
Kautuk, the native will attain kingship, lordship over wealth and skill in 
sexual acts and in sporting with harlots. Should waxing Candr, being yuti 
with Guru, be in Nidr, the native will be quite eminent. If waxing Candr is in 
Nidr, but devoid of Guru‟s Yuti, the native will lose his wealth on account of 
females and female jackals will be crying around his abode (as though it 
were a cemetery). 
64 75. Effects of the Avasthas of Mangal. If Mangal is in Sayan, the native 
will be troubled by wounds, itch and ulcer. If Mangal is placed in Upavesan, 
the native will be strong, sinful, untruthful, eminent, wealthy and bereft of 
virtues. If Mangal is placed in Lagn and happens to be in Netrapani, there 
will be penury; if placed in other Bhavas, Netrapani will confer rulership of a 
city. Should Mangal be in Prakash, the native will shine with virtues and will 
be honoured by the king. Mangal in Prakash in Putr will cause loss of 
children and of wife. If Mangal is in Prakash in Putr and happens to be 
there with Rahu, a severe (positional) fall will descend on the native. 
Should Mangal be in Gaman, the native will be always roaming, will have fear of multiple ulcers, will incur misunderstandings with females, will be 
afflicted by boils, itches etc. and will incur financial decline. If Mangal 
happens to be in Agaman Avastha, the native will be virtuous, endowed 
with precious gems, will adore a sharp sword, will walk with the gait of an 
elephant, will destroy his enemies and will remove the miseries of his 
people. If Mangal is placed in Sabh and happens to be in exaltation, the 
native will be skilful in conducting wars, will hold the flag of righteousness 
aloft and will be wealthy; if Mangal happens to be in Sabh in Putr, or 
Dharm, the native will be bereft of learning; if Mangal is in Sabh in Vyaya, 
childlessness and no wife and no friends will result; if Mangal is in other 
Bhavas in Sabh, the native will be a scholar in a king‟s court (poet 
laureate), be very wealthy, honourable and charitable. If Mangal is in 
Agam, the native will be devoid of virtues and good deeds, will be 
distressed by diseases, will acquire diseases of the root of the ears („Karan 
Mularogam‟ & „Padamulam Urumulam‟ etc.) and severe gout pains, will be 
timid and will befriend evil lot. If Mangal is with strength, while in Bhojan 
Avastha, the native will eat sweet-food; if devoid of strength, will indulge in 
base acts and be dishonourable. If Mangal is in Nritya Lips, the native will 
earn wealth through the king and will be endowed with fullness of gold, 
diamonds and corals in his house; if in Kautuk, will be curious in disposition 
and will be endowed with friends and sons; if in Kautuk and simultaneously 
exalted, will be honoured by the king and the virtuous and will be virtuous 
himself; if in Nidr, will be short-tempered, devoid of intelligence and wealth, 
will be wicked, fallen from virtuous path and troubled by diseases. Should 
Mangal be in Upavesan in Lagn, the native will be extremely sinful and he 
will incur several diseases, will be indigent and not peaceful. If Upavesan 
occurs for Mangal in Dharm, the native will lose his whole wealth apart from 
his wife and progeny. Mangal in Netrapani in Lagn will give poverty and will 
destroy the native‟s wife and progeny; if Mangal is in Netrapani in other 
Bhavas, this confers on the native all kinds of wealth and happiness from 
wife and children. The Dhan, or Yuvati position of Mangal in Netrapani will 
cause fear from lions and snakes apart from giving earnings from lands. 
Furthermore the native‟s wife will predecease him. Should Mangal be in 
Prakash in Putr, or in Yuvati, the native will lose his wife and all children. If 
Mangal is placed in Putr in Prakash and is yuti with Śani, the native will kill 
cows. Should Mangal be in Gaman in Lagn, the native will be active in his 
assignments, will incur diseases of the joints, burning pains in the eyes and 
will obtain dental afflictions and the like, he will have fear from dogs and will 
adore the guise of a female. In other Bhavas Mangal in Gaman will bring 
royal favours, leadership and luxuries of life. Mangal in Agaman will cause piles and diseases of the rectum. If Mangal is in Bhojan, or in Sayan in 
Putr, or in Randhr, there will be untimely death for the native. In other 
Bhavas Bhojan of Mangal will confer wealth. Should Mangal be in Nritya 
Lips and happens to be in Lagn, Dhan, Yuvati, or Karm, the native will 
receive all kinds of happiness; there will be miseries in abundance, if 
Mangal is in Nritya Lips and placed in Randhr, or Dharm, apart from 
incurring untimely death. In other Bhavas Nritya Lips of Mangal will make 
the native akin to Kuber. Mangal in Yuvati, or in Dharm in Kautuk will give 
several diseases and death of the first child and wife. In other Bhavas 
Kautuk will confer scholarship, various kinds of wealth, two wives and more 
female children. In Nidr Mangal in Lagn, Dhan, Sahaj, Dharm, Karm, or 
Labh will give scholarship, foolishness and poverty. Putr, or Yuvati 
placement of Mangal in Nidr will give many miseries and many male 
children. Should Rahu join Mangal in Nidr in any Bhava, the native will 
have many wives, be miserable and will suffer from some diseases on the 
surface of the feet. 
76-86. Effects of Budh‟s Avasthas. Should Budh in Sayan be in Lagn, the 
native will be lame and will have reddish eyes (like the black bee); if Budh 
is in Sayan in other Bhavas, the native will be addicted to licentious 
(disregarding certain rules) pleasures and be wicked. If Budh is in 
Upavesan in Lagn, the native will possess (the seven principle) virtues; if 
Budh in Upavesan is in Lagn, receiving a Drishti from a malefic, or Drishtis 
from malefics, or is yuti with malefics, penury will result; if Budh in 
Upavesan is in Lagn, receiving a Drishti from a benefic, or Drishtis from 
benefics, or is yuti with benefics, financial happiness will follow. If Budh is in 
Netrapani, the native will be devoid of learning, wisdom, well wishers and 
satisfaction, but he will be honourable; if Budh is in Putr in Netrapani, the 
subject will be bereft of happiness from wife and sons, will be endowed with 
(more) female children and will gain abundant finance through royal 
patronage. If Budh is in Prakash, the native will be charitable, merciful and 
meritorious, he will cross the boundaries of ocean in respect of many 
branches of learning, he will be endowed with the great faculty of 
discrimination and will destroy evil people; if in Gaman, will visit the courts 
of kings on many occasions and Goddess Lakshmi will dwell in his abode;

Kautuk in Lagn, the native will be skilful in music; if Budh is in Yuvati, or 
Randhr with Kautuk, the native will be addicted to courtezans; if Budh in 
Kautuk is placed in Dharm, the native will be meritorious and attain 
heavens after death. If Budh is in Nidr, the native will not enjoy comfortable 
sleep, will be afflicted by neck, or neck joint „Samadhi‟ diseases, will be 
devoid of co-born, afflicted by miseries galore, will enter into litigations with 
his own men and will lose wealth and honour.

99-110. Effects of Śukr‟s Avasthas. If Śukr is in Sayan, the native, although 
strong, will incur dental disease, he will be very short-tempered, bereft of 
wealth, will seek union with courtezans and be licentious; if in Upavesan, 
will be endowed with a multitude of nine gems („Navamin Vraja‟) and 
golden ornaments, be ever happy, will destroy enemies and will be 
honoured by the king, will have highly increased honours; if in Netrapani in 
Lagn, Yuvati, or Karm, there will be loss of wealth on account of afflictions 
of the sense of sight (heavy medical expenses, due to severe eye 
diseases); if Netrapani occurs, when Śukr is in other Bhavas, the native will 
own large houses. Should Śukr be in Prakash in its own Rāśi, in its 
exaltation Rāśi, or in a friendly Rāśi, the native will sport, like a lofty

135-146. Effects of Ketu‟s Avasthas. If Ketu is in Sayan in Mesh, Vrishabh,

Rāśis, increased diseases will follow. If Ketu is in Upavesan, the native will 
suffer from ulcers and will have fear from enemies, windy diseases, snakes 
and thieves. Should Ketu be in Netrapani, the native will contract eye 
diseases and will have fear from wicked people, snakes, enemies and

take to evil paths and will roam all over; if in Nidr, will be endowed with 
wealth and corns, will be virtuous and will spend his time sportively. 
147. General Effects (up to Sloka 155). O Brahmin, if a benefic Grah is in 
Sayan, there will be benefic effects at all times, according to the learned. 
148. If a malefic is in Bhojan, everything will be destroyed and there is no 
need of a second thought. 
149. Should a malefic in Yuvati be in Nidr, auspicious effects will follow, 
provided, that there is no Drishti from another malefic. 150. Declare without a second thought auspicious effects, following the 
location of a malefic in Putr Bhava, but only with Nidr, or in Sayan. 
151. Untimely death, due to royal wrath, will come to pass, if there is a 
malefic in Randhr Bhava in Nidr, or in Sayan. 
152. If in the case of a malefic in Randhr Bhava in Nidr, or Sayan there 
happens to be a benefic Drishti, or the Yuti of a benefic, (untimely) death 
will be in the river Ganges, i.e. Gangetic belt, shrines etc. 
153. If there is a malefic in Karm in Sayan, or Bhojan, the native will face 
many miseries on account of his own deeds. 
154. O excellent of the Brahmins, doubtlessly a Raj Yog will come to pass, 
if Candr is in Karm in Kautuk, or Prakash. 
155. Thus the good and bad effects should be guessed, assessing the 
strength and weakness of the Grahas, concerning all the Bhavas. 
Ch. 46. Dashas of Grahas 
1. Maitreya said. O Venerable Maharishi Parashar! You are omniscient. 
There is no subject, with which you are not conversant. Therefore now 
please favour me with guidance about the different kinds of Dashas 
(periods) of the various Grahas. 
2-5. Maharishi Parashar replied. O Brahmin! Dashas are of many kinds. 
Amongst them Vimshottari is the most appropriate for the general 
populace. But the other Dashas, followed in special cases, are Astottari, 
Shodshottari, Dwadashottari, Panchottari, Shatabdik, Chaturashiti-sama, 
Dwisaptati-sama, Shastihayani, Shat-trimshat-sama. Our ancients have 
described these different kinds of Dashas, based on Nakshatras. 
6-11. O Brahmin! Some Maharishis have made a mention of Kala and 
Chakr Dasha, but they have recognized the Kala Chakr Dasha, as 
supreme. The other kinds of Dashas, propagated by the sages, are Char, 
Sthir, Kendr, Karak, Brahma Grah, Manduk, Shul, Yogardh, Drig, Trikon, 
Rāśi, Panchswara, Yogini, Pind, Nausargik, Asht Varg, Sandhya, Pachak, 
Tara etc. But in our view all these Dashas are not appropriate. 
Vimshottari 12-14. Beginning from Kritika, the Lords of Dashas are Sūrya, Candr, 
Mangal, Rahu, Guru, Śani, Budh, Ketu and Śukr in that order. Thus, if the 
Nakshatras from Kritika to the Janm Nakshatr are divided by nine, the 
remainder will signify the Lord of the commencing Dasha. The remaining 
Dashas will be of the Grahas in the order, given above. In Kali Yuga the 
natural life-span of a human being is generally taken, as 120 years. 
Therefore Vimshottari Dasha is considered to be the most appropriate and 
the best of all Dashas. 
15. The periods of Dashas of Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Rahu, Guru, Śani, 
Budh, Ketu and Śukr are 6, 10, 7, 18, 16, 19, 17, 7 and 20 in that order. 
16. To find out the remainder of the Dasha, operating at the time of birth, 
first find out the expired portion of the Dasha of the concerned Grah. This is 
done, as follows. Multiply the Dasha period of the Grah concerned by the 
period of the stay of Candr in Janm Nakshatr, that has expired and divide 
that amount by the total period of the stay of Candr in that Nakshatr. The 
figure in years, months etc. so arrived at will be the expired period of the 
Dasha. If this figure is deducted from the total period of the Dasha, we will 
get the balance of Dasha at the time of birth. 
Ashtottari 
17-20. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin, the sages have recommended 
the adoption of Ashtottari, when Rahu not being in Lagn, in any other 
Kendr, or Trikon to the Lord of the Lagn. From 4 Nakshatras from Ardra 
commences the Dasha of Sūrya, from 3 after that begins the Dasha of 
Candr, 4 after that will bring the Dasha of Mangal, 3 after that the Lord of 
Dasha will be Budh, 4 therefrom will have Śani, as the Dasha Lord, 3 
thereafter the Lord will be Guru, Rahu will be the Lord of the Dasha 4 
Nakshatras after that and then Śukr will take over the lordship of the Dasha 
3 Nakshatras from the last one mentioned above. The Lord of the Dasha at 
birth will be determined by counting in this order up to the Janm Nakshatr. 
The duration of Ashtottari Dasha for Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Śani, 
Guru, Rahu and Śukr are 6, 15, 8, 17, 10, 19, 12 and 21 in that order. Thus 
in this Dasha system only 8 Grahas play the role of Dasha Lords, Ketu 
having been denied this privilege. 
21-22. The Dashas of the various Grahas have been specified above. In 
the case of malefic Grahas the Dasha span of one Nakshatr is ¼ of the Dasha of the Grah. It is 1/3rd in the case of benefics. Thus the expired 
portion of the Dasha is calculated, according to the method, followed for 
Vimshottari Dasha, by multiplying the Bhayat, i.e. the expired period of the 
stay of Candr in the Janm Nakshatr, by the Dasha portion of the Janm 
Nakshatr and dividing it by Bhabhog, i.e. the total period of the stay of 
Candr in the Janm Nakshatr. Then the balance of Dasha at birth can also 
be ascertained. If Uttarashadha happens to be the Janm Nakshatr, the 
duration of its first three Padas is taken, as Bhabhog and the Dasha 
calculations should be done accordingly. The Dasha and calculations for 
Abhijit Nakshatr are done by taking the 4th Pad of Uttarashadha plus the 
15th part of the beginning of Shravan. For Shravan the Bhabhog would be 
the total of its duration in Ghatikas minus the 1/15th part of the beginning of 
Shravan. 
Shodshottari 
23. It will be advisable to adopt the Shodshottari, if the birth is in the day in 
Krishna Paksh (dark half of the month), or at night in Shukla Paksh (bright 
half). 
24-26. The Dasha may be adopted, when the Lagn is in the Hora of Candr 
with birth in the Krishna Paksh, or, when Lagn is in the Hora of Sūrya with 
birth in the Shukla Paksh. Count the number of Nakshatras from Pushya to 
the Janm Nakshatr. Divide this number by 8. The remainder will indicate 
the Dashas of Sūrya, Mangal, Guru, Śani, Ketu, Candr, Budh and Śukr. 
The Dashas of the above Grahas are of 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 
years. 
Dwadashottari 
27-28. This Dasha system will be appropriate for one, whose Lagn is in the 
Navāńś of Śukr. Count from Janm Nakshatr to Revati. Divide this number 
by 8. The remainder will indicate the Dasha of the Grah concerned. The 
Dasha order is Sūrya, Guru, Ketu, Budh, Rahu, Mangal, Śani, Candr. The 
Dashas will be of 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 years of the Grahas. 
Panchottari  
(29-30) This Dasha is considered suitable for those, whose Lagn is Kark 
and also in the Kark Dvadashāńś. Count from Anuradha up to the Janm 
Nakshatr and divide the number by 7. The remainder will indicate the Dasha. The order of the Dasha Lords is Sūrya, Budh, Śani, Mangal, Śukr, 
Candr and Guru. The Dashas of the Grahas are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 
18 years. 
Shatabdik 
(31-32) This Dasha system has been considered appropriate, if Lagn is 
Vargottama. This happens, when Lagn in the Rāśi Kundali and the Navāńś 
Lagn are in the same Rāśi. 
(33-34) Count from Revati to the Janm Nakshatr and divide this number by 
seven. The remainder will indicate the Lords of Dashas in this order: Sūrya, 
Candr, Śukr, Budh, Guru, Mangal and Śani. Their Dashas will be of 5, 5, 
10, 10, 20, 20 and 30 years. 
Chaturashiti-sama 
35-36. Chaturashiti-sama Dasha is considered appropriate in cases, where 
the Karm‟s Lord is placed in Karm. Count from Swati to the Janm Nakshatr 
and divide this number by 7. The remainder will indicate the Dasha Lords in 
the following order: Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr and Śani. The 
Dasha period of each Grah is 12 years. 
Dwisaptati-sama 
37-39. This Dasha system is considered suitable in cases, where the Lord 
of Lagn is in Lagn, or in Yuvati. Count from Mul to the Janm Nakshatr and 
divide the number by 8. The remainder will determine the Dasha Lords in 
the following order: Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr, Śani and 
Rahu. In this Dasha system all the eight Grahas have Dashas of 9 years 
each. 
Shastihayani 
40-41. This Dasha may be adopted in cases, where Sūrya is posited in 
Lagn. The order of Dasha Lords in this system is, as follows: Guru, Sūrya, 
Mangal, Candr, Budh, Śukr, Śani and Rahu. The following shows the 
Nakshatras, falling under the various Dasha Lords. The Dashas of Guru, 
Sūrya and Mangal are of 10 years. The remaining Grahas have Dashas of 
6 years each. Guru (Ashvini, Bharani, Kritika, Punarvasu), Sūrya (Rohini, 
Mrigashira, Ardra, U.Ashadha), Mangal (Pushya, Aslesha, Magha, Revati), Candr (P.Phalguni, U.Phalguni, Hast), Budh (Swati, Vishakah, Anuradha), 
Śukr (Jyeshtha, Mul, P.Ashadha), Śani (Abhijit, Shravan, Dhanishtha), 
Rahu (Shatabhisha, P.Bhadra, U.Bhadra). 
Shat-trimshat-sama 
42-43. Count from Shravan to the Janm Nakshatr and divide the number by 
8. The remainder 1 etc. will indicate the Dasha Lords, whose order will be, 
as follows: Candr, Sūrya, Guru, Mangal, Budh, Śani, Śukr and Rahu. Their 
Dashas will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 years. If the birth is during the day 
and Lagn is in the Hora of Sūrya and, if the birth is at night and Lagn is in 
the Hora of Candr, adoption of this system would be preferable. 
Kaal 
44-49. 5 Ghatikas before the sight of the semi-disk of the setting Sūrya and 
5 Ghatikas after that and 5 Ghatikas before and after the rising of Sūrya, 
that is 10 Ghatikas in the evening and 10 Ghatikas in the morning, 
respectively. The total period of both these Sandhyas (twilight) is said to be 
20 Ghatikas. The 20 Ghatikas of the night have been given the name 
Purna and the 20 Ghatikas of the day have been given the name Mugdha. 
The Sandhya at the time of sunrise is called Khanda and the Sandhya at 
the time of sunset is said to be Sudh. Both of these Sandhyas are of 10 
Ghatikas each. If the birth is in Purna, or Mugdha, its past Ghatikas should 
be multiplied by 2 and the product should be divided by 15. The figure so 
arrived at should be converted into years, months etc. By multiplying it by 
the serial number of Sūrya and other Grahas in their normal order, we will 
get the Kaal Dasha of these Grahas. If the birth is during Sandhya, then its 
past Ghatikas should be multiplied by 4 and the product divided by 15. The 
figure so arrived at in terms of years, months etc. should be multiplied by 
the serial number of Sūrya and the other Grahas to get the Kaal Dasha of 
all the nine Grahas. 
Chakr 
50-51. If the birth is at night, the Dasha will commence from Lagn Rāśi. If 
the birth is during the day, the Dasha will start from the Rāśi, in which the 
Lord of Lagn is placed. If the birth is during Sandhya, the Dasha will begin 
from the Rāśi of the second Bhava. The Dasha of each Rāśi is 10 years. 
As it is the Dasha system of the 12 Rāśis in the Zodiac, it has been named, 
as Chakr Dasha. Kaal Chakr 
52-53. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! Now, after making obedience 
to Lord Shiva, I shall describe the Kala Chakr Dasha. Whatever was related 
by Lord Shiva to Goddess Parvati, is being explained by me for the use of 
sages to be utilized for the welfare of the people. 
54-55. By drawing vertical and horizontal lines, prepare 2 Kundalis, Savya 
and Apsavya, of 12 apartments (Kosthas) each. From the second Kostha in 
each Kundali fix the Rāśis Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Simh, Kanya, 
Tula, Vrischik, Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh, Meen. Then Nakshatras may be 
incorporated in the manner, indicated hereafter. These Kundalis, indicative 
of the 12 Rāśis, are called Kala Chakr. 
56-58. Write Ashvini, Bharani and Kritika in the Savya Chakr and Rohini, 
Mrigashira, Ardra in the Apsavya. Then incorporate the three following 
Nakshatras, Punarvasu, Pushya and Aslesha in the Savya and Magha, 
Purvaphalguni and Uttaraphalguni in the Apsavya. Then incorporate the 
three following, Hast, Chitra and Swati in the Savya and Vishakah, 
Anuradha and Jyeshtha in the Apsavya. Then incorporate Mul, 
Purvashadha and Uttarashadha in the Savya and Shravan, Dhanishtha and 
Shatabhisha in the Apsavya. Finally incorporate the last three Nakshatras, 
Purvabhadrapad, Uttarabhadrapad and Revati in the Savya Chakr. Now 
there will be 15 Nakshatras in the Savya and 12 Nakshatras in the 
Apsavya, (because for the 12 Rāśis there are 12 Padas of 3 Nakshatras, 
the Navāńśas). The Padas of Ashvini, Punarvasu, Hast, Mul, 
Purvabhadrapad, Kritika, Aslesha, Swati, Uttarashadha and Revati of the 
Savya should be reckoned in the same manner, as the Padas of Ashvini. 
59. Now I shall describe in detail, how the Deha and Jiva should be 
reckoned in the Padas (quarters) of the Nakshatras. 
60. In the first Pad of Ashvini Mesh is indicative of Deha (body) and Dhanu 
is indicative of Jiva (life). And the Lords of Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, 
Simh, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik and Dhanu are Lords of the Dashas in the 
order, as described before. 
61. In the second Pad of Ashvini Makar is Deha and Mithun is Jiva and the 
Lords of the nine Rāśis from Makar to Mithun are Lords of the Dashas. 62. In the third Pad of the ten Nakshatras, beginning from Ashvini, Vrishabh 
is Deha and Mithun is Jiva. The Lords of the Rāśis Vrishabh, Mesh, Meen, 
Kumbh, Makar, Dhanu, Mesh, Vrishabh and Mithun are Lords of the 
Dashas in that order. 
63-64. For the 4th Pad of the 10 Nakshatras, beginning from Ashvini, Kark 
is Deha and Meen is Jiva and the Lords of the nine Rāśis from Kark to 
Meen are the Lords of Dashas. 
65. In the four Padas of the 5 Nakshatras, Bharani, Pushya, Chitra, 
Purvashadha and Uttarabhadrapad, Deha and Jiva are the same, as for 
Bharani.  
66. In the first Pad of Bharani Vrischik is Deha and Meen is Jiva and the 
Lords of the Rāśis Vrischik, Tula, Kanya, Kark, Simh, Mithun, Vrishabh, 
Mesh and Meen are the Lords of Dashas in this order. 
67. In the 2nd Pad of Bharani Kumbh is Deha and Kanya is Jiva and the 
Lords of Kumbh, Makar, Dhanu, Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Simh and 
Kanya are the Lords of Dashas in that order. 
68. In the 3rd Pad of Bharani Tula is Deha and Kanya is Jiva and Lords of 
the Rāśis Tula, Vrischik, Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh, Meen, Vrischik, Tula and 
Kanya are the Dasha Lords in this order. 
69. In the 4th Pad of Bharani Kark is Deha and Kumbh is Jiva and the Lords 
of the Rāśis Kark, Simh, Mithun, Vrishabh, Mesh, Meen, Kumbh, Makar 
and Dhanu are the Dasha Lords in this order. 
71-72. O Brahmin! I have thus given you the description of Savya Chakr. 
Now I shall give the description of Apsavya Chakr. Prepare a similar chart 
of 12 apartments and from the 2nd apartment onwards place the Rāśis from 
Vrischik onwards in the reverse order. In this chart Deha and Jiva would be 
the same for Rohini, Magha, Vishakah and Shravan, as for Rohini. 
73-76. In the first Pad of Rohini Kark is Deha and Dhanu is Jiva. The Lords 
of the Rāśis Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh, Meen, Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Simh 
and Tula will be the Dasha Lords in this order. In the 2nd Tula will be Deha 
and Kanya the Jiva and the Lords of the Rāśis Kanya, Tula, Vrischik, 
Meen, Kumbh, Makar, Dhanu, Vrischik and Vrischik will be the Dasha 
Lords. In the 3rd Kumbh will be Deha and Kanya Jiva. The Lords of the Rāśis Kanya, Simh, Kark, Mithun, Vrishabh, Mesh, Dhanu, Makar and 
Kumbh will be the Dasha Lords. In the 4th Vrischik will be Deha and Meen 
Jiva and the Lords of the Rāśis Meen, Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Simh, Kark, 
Kanya, Tula and Vrischik will be the Lords. 
77. In the 4 Padas of the Apsavya Nakshatras Mrigashira, Ardra, 
Purvaphalguni, Uttaraphalguni, Anuradha, Jyeshtha, Dhanishtha and 
Shatabhisha the Deha and Jiva and the Dasha Lords will be the same, as 
for Mrigashira. 
78-81. In the first Pad of Mrigashira Kark is Deha and Meen is Jiva and the 
Lords of the Rāśis Meen, Kumbh, Makar, Dhanu, Vrischik, Tula, Kanya, 
Simh and Kark will be the Dasha Lords in this order. In the 2nd Vrishabh is 
Deha and Mithun is Jiva and the Lords of the Rāśis Mithun, Vrishabh, 
Mesh, Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh, Meen, Mesh and Vrishabh will be the Dasha 
Lords. In the 3rd Makar is Deha and Mithun is Jiva and the Lords of the 
Rāśis Mithun, Simh, Kark, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik, Meen, Kumbh and Makar 
will be the Dasha Lords. In the 4th Mesh will be Deha and Dhanu Jiva an d 
the Lords of the Rāśis Dhanu, Vrischik, Tula, Kanya, Simh, Kark, Mithun, 
Vrishabh and Mesh will be the Dasha Lords. 
82. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! The description of the Deha and 
Jiva of the Padas of the Apsavya Nakshatras and the Dasha Lords is the 
same, as narrated by Lord Mahadeva to Goddess Parvati. 
83. Maitreya said. O Venerable Maharishi Parashar! Now please guide me 
about the Dasha spans of the Dasha Lords, described by you. Please also 
demonstrate, how the commencement of the Dasha, its expired and the 
remaining periods at the birth are to be calculated. 
84. Maharishi Parashar said. 5, 21, 7, 9, 10, 16 and 4 years are the Dasha 
spans of Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr and Śani. 
85-86. The span of life of a person is determined from the Padas (Ańśas) of 
the Nakshatr at the time of birth, or the time of query and the years allotted 
to the 9 Rāśis, commencing from it (the Pad of the Nakshatr). Some sages 
are of the view, that the person will enjoy full span of life (Purna Ayu), if his 
birth is at the commencement of the Padas, will have middle span of life 
(Madhaya Ayu), if the birth is in the middle of the Padas and short span of 
life („Alap Ayu‟), or will face death-like sufferings, if the birth is at the end of 
the Padas of the Nakshatr. 87-88. According to this principle, we should be acquainted with the Padas 
of the Nakshatras. Now I shall tell you, how the calculations are made, 
according to the proportion of the Padas of a Nakshatr. The number of 
Ashvini etc., whichever may be the past Nakshatras, should be divided by 
3. Thereafter the remainder should be multiplied by 4. To the figure so 
made available the Pad of the present Nakshatr should be added. The 
product will be the Navāńś from Mesh onwards. 
89. The number of years (Purna Ayu) are, as under. For the Ańś in Mesh 
100 years, in Vrishabh 85 years, in Mithun 83 years, in Kark 86 years. The 
number of years will be the same for Rāśis, situated the 5th and 9th to them. 
90-91. Multiply the past Ghatikas, Palas etc. of the Pad of the Nakshatr, in 
which a person is born, by the existing Dasha years and divide it by 15. 
The result will indicate the expired period of the Dasha in years, months 
etc. By deducting it from the total number of years allotted, we get the 
balance of Dasha at birth. The Dasha should be taken, as commencing 
from that Rāśi. 
92. Multiply the past Ghatikas, Palas etc. of the present Pad of the 
Nakshatr by the number of years and divide the product by the fourth part 
of Bhabhog. The years etc. so obtained may then be deducted from the 
total Dasha period. The result will be the balance of Dasha at birth in years, 
months etc. 
93. The past Kalas (minutes) of the Navāńś, in which Candr may be 
placed, should be multiplied by the years, allotted to the Dasha and the 
product should be divided by 200. The resulting years etc. will be the 
expired portion of the Dasha. By deducting them from the total number of 
years the balance of the Dasha at birth is obtained. 
94-95. In the Savya Chakr the first Ańś is called Deha and the last Jiva. 
The opposite is the case in the Apsavya Chakr. Therefore the calculations 
should be based on the Deha etc. in the Savya Chakr and on the Jiva etc. 
in Apsavya. 
We give below the Savya and Apsavya Kaal Chakr Charts. For Example. 
The birth is in Mrigashira 4th Pad. It is in the Apsavya Kaal Chakr. The Lord 
of Deha is Mangal and that of Jiva is Guru. The Bhabhog of Mrigashira is 
59/31 (59 Ghatikas 31 Palas) and Bhayat is 58/15 (58 Ghatikas 15 Palas). 
¼ of the Bhabhog comes to 14/52/44. That would be the value of one Pad. Multiplying this by 3 will get Ghatikas of 3 Padas, namely 44/38/15. 
Deducting this from Bhayat, the past Ghatikas, Palas etc. of the 4th Pad will 
be 13/36/45. The full Dasha years are 100. Multiplying this by 13/36/45 we 
get 1300/3600/4500 = 1361/15. This divided by 15 will give the expired 
period at birth, namely 90 years and 9 months. See the Kaal Chakr. There 
we count from Jiva etc. to Deha. In the 4th Pad of Mrigashira Jiva is in 
Dhanu and Deha in Mesh. Therefore, by deducting the total of years from 
Dhanu to Mithun, namely 77, from 90 years 9 months, we get the expired 
period of Vrishabh, namely 13 years and 9 months. By deducting this from 
the present 16 years of Śukr, we will get 2 years and 3 months, as the 
balance of Dasha at birth. Accordingly, like Vimshottari Dasha, the order of 
Dasha will be Vrishabh, Mesh, Dhanu, Vrischik etc. 
For Example. Suppose, that at the time of birth of a person in Kritika 
Nakshatr the longitude of Candr (Candr Spast) is 1r4°50‟. This converted 
into Kalas will be 2090 at birth. The Dasha should be taken, as 
commencing from that. Divide the Kalas by 800 (1 Nakshatr). The result will 
be the 2nd Nakshatr, namely Bharini and the remainder will be 490. These 
will be the past Kalas of Kritika. There are 200 Kalas in one Pad (Navāńś). 
Divide 490, the past Kalas of Kritika, by 200. We will then get 2, as past 
Padas and the remainder 90 will represent the past Kalas of the present 
Nakshatr. By multiplying this by 83, the Dasha years, we will get 7470, 
which, divided by 200, will indicate the expired portion of the Dasha, as 37 
years, 4 months and 6 days. By deducting the years of Dehāńś, 
commencing from Vrishabh, in the order Vrishabh, Mesh, Meen, Kumbh 
(16+7+10+4 = 37), we will get 0 years, 4 months and 6 days. This will be 
the expired portion of Makar. Deducting this from 4, the Dasha period of 
Makar, we get the balance of the Dasha of Makar, namely 3 years, 7 
months and 24 days. See in this connection the Savya Kaal Chakr. 
Gati of Rāśis in the Kaal Chakr 
96-98. There are three kinds of movements (Gati) of the Rāśis in the Kaal 
Chakr, namely Manduki, Markati and Simhavlokan. The movement of one 
Rāśi by jumping over one Rāśi is known, as Manduki Gati. Backward 
movement to the previous Rāśi is called Markati Gati. The movement of a 
Rāśi to the 5th and 9th Rāśi is said to be Simhavlokan. 99-100. Movement from Kanya to Kark and from Simh to Mithun is Manduki 
Gati. Movement from Simh to Kark is Markati Gati. Movement from Meen to 
Vrischik and from Dhanu to Mesh is called Simhavlokan Gati. 
Effects of Dashas of Rāśis, as a Result of these Gati 
101-102. The effects of the Dasha of the Rāśis with Manduki Gati in the 
Savya Chakr are distress to friends, relations, parents and elders and there 
is likely to be cause for trouble from poison, weapons, thieves and 
enemies. In the Manduki Dasha of the Gati of a Rāśi from Simh to Mithun 
there is the likelihood of the death of the mother, or self, trouble from 
Government and possibility of brain fever. 
103. The effects of the Dasha of Rāśi with Markati Gati in the Savya Chakr 
are loss of wealth, agricultural products and animals, death of father, or an 
elderly close relation and feeling of lethargy. 
104-105. The effects of the Dasha of the Rāśis with Simhavlokan Gati in 
the Savya Chakr are possibility of injury from animals, loss of amity with 
friends, distress to near relations, drowning in a well, fall from animals, 
possibility of harm from poison, weapons and diseases and destruction of 
residential dwelling. 
106-108. In the Dasha of the Rāśis with the Manduki Gati in the Apsavya 
Chakr the effects will be distress to wife and conditions, loss of children, 
possibility of feverish conditions and loss of position. In the Dasha of the 
Rāśis with the Markati Gati there may be danger from watery places, loss 
of position, distress from father, punishment from Government and 
wandering in the forests; with the Simhavlokan there may be destruction of 
the dwelling and death of father etc. 
109-111. If the movement is from Meen to Vrischik, the native may suffer 
from fever; if from Kanya to Kark, there may be loss of brothers and 
kinsmen; if from Simh to Mithun, there may be ill health of the wife; if from 
Simh to Kark, the native may die; if from Dhanu to Mesh, there may be 
death of uncles and similar relations. If the Rāśi is yuti with a malefic, 
adverse conditions may be expected in the Dasha of the Rāśi. Favourable 
effects will be felt in its Dasha, if the Rāśi is yuti with a benefi c. 112-113. O Brahmin! In the Kaal Chakr Dasha favourable and unfavourable 
effects may be predicted, after taking into account the directions of the 
Rāśis and Grahas. 
114-119. If the movement is from Kanya to Kark, good results are realized 
in places, located in the East and at that time journeys to the places in the 
North prove fruitful. Unfavourable effects will be felt in places, located in the 
West and the South. It will be advisable not to undertake journeys in those 
directions in the Dasha of these Rāśis. If the movement is from Simh to 
Mithun, no journey should be undertaken to places, located in the East. 
However, the journeys to the South-West will prove fruitful in the Dasha of 
those Rāśis. If the movement is from Kark to Simh, journeys during that 
period to the South will prove unfavourable and result in loss and the native 
has to return from the South to the West. If the movement is from Meen to 
Vrischik, there will distress, if the native goes to the North. The same would 
happen, if the movement is from Dhanu to Makar. There may be ill health, 
imprisonment, or death, if the movement is from Dhanu to Mesh. There 
may be gains, comforts and property and marriage, if the movement is from 
Dhanu to Vrischik. It will not be advisable to undertake journeys to the West 
during the related period, if the movement is from Simh to Kark. Favourable 
results should be predicted, if the Rāśis are yuti with benefics and adverse, 
if the Rāśis are yuti with malefics. 
120-122. According to the above-mentioned Kaal Chakr, the person, born 
in the Ańśas of the various Rāśis, will be, as under. Mesh Ańś brave and a 
thief, Vrishabh wealthy, Mithun learned, Kark king, Simh respected by king, 
Kanya learned, Tula minister, or adviser, Dhanu sinful, Kumbh 
businessman, Meen wealthy. 
123-128. If the Deha, or Jiva Rāśis are yuti with Sūrya, Mangal, Śani, or 
Rahu, the native will die. Worse results may be expected, if the Deha and 
Jiva Rāśis are yuti with two, or all of them. If there is a malefic in Deha 
Rāśi, the native suffers ill health; a malefic in a Jiva Rāśi will make the 
native very timid. If the Deha and/or Jiva Rāśi are yuti with two malefics, 
there will be distress and diseases. Three malefics in the Deha and/or Jiva 
Rāśi will cause premature death. Four malefics in the Deha and Jiva Rāśi 
will cause definite death. If both the Deha and Jiva Rāśis are occupied by 
malefics, there will be fear from king and thieves and death of the native. If 
Sūrya is in the Deha, or Jiva Rāśi, there will be danger from fire. Candr in 
the Deha, or Jiva Rāśi will cause danger from water, Mangal fear from weapons, Budh fear from windy troubles, Śani fear from Gulma (a disease), 
Rahu and Ketu fear from poison. If the Deha, or Jiva Rāśis are occupied by 
Budh, Guru and Śukr, the native will be wealthy, will enjoy all kinds of 
comforts and will have good health. Mixed results may be expected, if the 
Deha and Jiva Rāśis are occupied by both benefics and malefics. 
129-130. In the Dasha of the Rāśis, owned by malefics, the body and soul 
will be in distress. The effects will be favourable in the Dasha of the Rāśis, 
owned by benefics. If a malefic Rāśi is occupied by a benefic Grah, or, if a 
benefic Rāśi is occupied by a malefic Grah, the effects will be of a mixed 
nature. 
Effects of Kaal Chakr Dasha of the Rāśis in Lagn and other Bhavas. 
131-132. In the Kaal Chakr Dasha of the Rāśi in Lagn the body remains 
healthy and the native spends a life with many kinds of comforts. If the 
Lagn Rāśi is a benefic one, the good effects are realized fully. If the Lagn 
Rāśi is a malefic Rāśi, there is likelihood of ill health. If a Grah in exaltation, 
or in its own Rāśi occupies Lagn, the native is respected by the king, or 
government and acquires wealth. 
133-134. In the Chakr Dasha of the Rāśi in Dhan the native receives good 
food, enjoys happiness of wife and children, gains wealth, achieves 
progress in the educational sphere, becomes a clever conversationalist and 
moves in good society. If the Rāśi be a benefic, good effects are realized in 
full, otherwise the effects would be of a mixed nature. 
135-136. Happiness from co-borns, valour, patience, comforts, acquisition 
of gold, ornaments and clothes and recognition by the king, or government, 
are the effects in the Kaal Chakr Dasha of the Rāśi in Sahaj. If the Rāśi is a 
benefic, the good results are realized in full, otherwise adverse effects may 
also be experienced. 
137-138. Good relations with kinsmen, acquisition of land, houses, or a 
kingdom, conveyances and clothes and enjoyment of sound health, are the 
effects of the Chakr Dasha of the Rāśi in Bandhu. If the Rāśi is a benefic 
one, the good effects are realized in full. If it is a malefic Rāśi, adverse 
results are also experienced. 
139-140. Being blessed with wife and children, favours from Government, 
enjoyment of sound health, good relations with friends, achievement of fame, good progress in the educational sphere, patience and valour are the 
effects of the Chakr Dasha of the Rāśi in Putr. If the Rāśi is a benefic one, 
the good results are enjoyed in full. If the Rāśi is a malefic one, adverse 
effects are also experienced. 
141-142. Danger from the king, fire and weapons and the possibility of 
suffering from diabetes, Gulma and jaundice are the effects in the Chakr 
Dasha of the Rāśi in Ari. If the Rāśi is a malefic one, the above adverse 
effects will be experienced in full. There will be some mitigation of the evil 
effects in the case of a benefic Rāśi. 
143-144. Marriage, conjugal happiness, being blessed with children, gain of 
agricultural products, cows and clothes, favours and recognition from the 
king and achievement of fame, are the effects in the Chakr Dasha of the 
Rāśi in Yuvati. The beneficial results will be experienced in full, if the Rāśi 
is a benefic one. Meagre good effects will be realized in the case of a 
malefic Rāśi. 
145-146. Destruction of a residential house, distress, loss of wealth, 
poverty and danger from enemies are the effects of the Chakr Dasha of the 
Rāśi in Randhr. The adverse effects will be realized in full, if the Rāśi is a 
malefic one. Some mitigation in evil effects may be expected in the case of 
a benefic Rāśi. 
(147-157) … 
…Char 
158-166. Now I will tell you about the working out of the Dasha years of 
Vrischik and Kumbh. If both the Lords of the two Rāśis, Vrischik and 
Kumbh, are placed in their own Rāśis, their Dasha will be of 12 years. 
Otherwise the Dasha will be of the number of years, indicated by the 
number, counted from that Rāśi to the Rāśi, occupied by its Lord. If one 
Grah be in his own Rāśi and the other in any other Rāśi, the Dasha will be 
of the number of years counted, from the above first Rāśi to the other. If the 
Lords are in different Rāśis, the counting is to be done up to the Rāśi, 
which is stronger. The Rāśi, which has a Grah, placed in it, is considered 
more powerful than the Rāśi without a Grah in it. If both are with Grahas in 
them, the one with more Grahas would be considered more powerful. If 
both Rāśis are occupied by an equal number of Grahas, the strength of the 
Rāśi itself should be taken into account. The principle for considering the Bal of the Rāśi is, that the Fixed Rāśi is considered stronger than the 
Movable one and the Dual Rāśi is considered more powerful than the Fixed 
Rāśi. If there is equality in the strength of the Rāśis, then to determine the 
number of years of Dasha counting should be done up to the Rāśi with 
bigger number. If one Rāśi is occupied by a Grah in exaltation, the counting 
should be done up to that Rāśi only. In addition 1 should be added in the 
number of years in the case of a Rāśi with an exalted Grah and 1 should be 
deducted from the number of years in the case of a Rāśi with a Grah in 
debilitation. The prediction should be made after calculating the Dashas in 
this manner. 
167. If the Rāśi in Dharm Bhava is in an odd Pad, the counting should be 
from the Rāśi in the Lagn onwards. The counting would be in the reverse 
order, if the Pad is even. The Dashas of Rāśis have to be fixed, keeping 
this in view. 
For Example. In the above Tula is the Rāśi in Dharm Bhava in an odd Pad. 
Amongst the Lords of Lagn, Śani and Rahu, Rahu is associated with a 
Grah. Therefore Rahu is more powerful than, Śani. Therefore counting 
should be done up to Rahu. Kumbh is in even Pad, therefore counting ha s 
to be done from Kumbh up to Rahu in the reverse order, by which the Char 
Dasha for Kumbh would come to 8 years. Mesh is in odd Pad. Therefore 
the Char Dasha for Mesh will be one year. The Dasha of other Rāśis 
should be calculated in the same manner. 
Sthir 
168-169. Maharishi Parashar said. Now I am going to describe the Sthir 
Dasha. In this Dasha system 7, 8 and 9 years are the Dasha spans of the 
Movable (Char), Fixed (Sthir) and Dual (Dvisva Bhava) Rāśis. In this 
system the Dasha of the 12 Rāśis begins from the Brahm Grah Ashrit Rāśi. 
The Dashas are counted onwards from the odd Rāśis and in the reverse 
order from the even Rāśis. 
170-173. Maitreya said. O great Sage! Now please enlighten me how the 
Brahm Grah is picked out in a chart. Maharishi Parashar said. From 
amongst the Lords of Ari, Randhr and Vyaya the Grah, who may possess 
the greatest strength and is placed in Lagn, or in Yuvati with strength, the 
one, placed in an odd Rāśi within sixth Bhava from the Bhava concerned, is 
called the Brahm Grah. The Lord of Randhr in Randhr is also accepted, as Brahm Grah. If Śani, or Rahu/Ketu obtain Brahmatva (qualifications of 
Brahm Grah), they become Brahm Grah. If a number of Grahas obtain 
Brahmatva, the one with the largest number of degrees would become 
Brahm Grah. If there is parity in the degrees of such Grahas, the most 
powerful amongst them would become Brahm Grah. 
Yogardha 
174. The spans of Dashas of the Rāśis in the Yogardha Dasha system are 
half of the total of the spans of Char and Sthir Dashas. The Dasha will 
commence from the Rāśi of Lagn, or Yuvati, whichever is stronger. The 
order of the Dashas of the 12 Rāśis will be counted onwards, if the opening 
Dasha Rāśi is an odd one. If it be an even Rāśi, the Dashas will be in 
reverse order. 
Kendradi 
175-176.  In this system there are Dashas of Fixed Rāśis in the Kendr etc. 
from Lagn, or from Yuvati, whichever is stronger. If Lagn, or Yuvati with 
strength is placed in an odd Rāśi, the Kendr etc. are counted in the onward 
order. If it be in an even Rāśi, the counting will be in the backward, or 
reverse order. In them also the Dashas would be in the order of 
comparative strength of the Rāśis. The order of Dashas would be the 
same, as reckoned from the Atma Karak. The spans of Dashas would be 
the same, as they are in the Char Dasha. In calculating the years of 
Dashas of Grahas, counting is done from the Grah to his own Rāśi. The 
years of Dashas would be the number, arrived at by counting up to the Rāśi 
of the Grah, which is stronger, or more in number. 
177. If a Grah owns two Rāśis, the Dasha years will be equal to the 
number, which is greater, when counted from the Rāśi, occupied by him. 
Notes. Under this system Dashas are of two kinds, namely Lagn Kendradi 
and Atma Karak Kendradi. There are also Kendradi Rāśi Dasha, or 
Kendradi Grah Dasha in both the Dasha systems, mentioned above.  
Karak 
178. The system, under which the first Dasha is of the Atma Karak and the 
subsequent Dashas are of the remaining 7 Karakas in their order is known, as Karak Dasha. In this system the Dasha years are equal to the number of 
Rāśis, counted from Lagn up to the Karak concerned. 
Manduk 
179-180. Under the Manduk Dasha system the Dasha commences from 
Lagn, or Yuvati Bhava, whichever is stronger. If the Rāśi of commencement 
is an odd Rāśi, the Dashas of 3 Movable, 3 Fixed and 3 Dual Rāśis will be 
counted in the onwards order. They will be in the reverse order in the case 
of an even Rāśi. In this system the Dasha years will be the same, as in 
Sthir Dasha. In this system every Dasha is of the next 3rd Rāśi. 
Shula 
181-182. Some sages have designed the Shula Dasha for determining the 
time of death. In this system the Dasha commences from Dhan, or Randhr, 
whichever is stronger. If the Rāśi is an odd one, the order of the Dasha 
Rāśis will be onwards. It will be backwards in the case of an even Rāśi. 
The Dasha years in this system are, as adopted for the Sthir Dasha. There 
is a possibility, that death appears in the Dasha of the Marak Rāśi, which 
has greater strength. 
Trikon 
183-184. In this system the first Dasha commences from the strongest 
amongst the Rāśis in Kon (Trikon) to Lagn (Tanu, Putr and Dharm). This 
system is similar to the Char Dasha. Here also the Dashas of the Rāśis will 
be in the onwards order in the case of odd Rāśis and in the reverse order in 
the case of even Rāśis. The Dasha years will be similar to that of Char 
Dasha. It has been named Trikon because of the commencement of the 
Dasha from the Rāśis in Konas. 
Dirga 
185-187. In this system the order of the Dashas is, as follows: the Rāśi, 
occupying Dharm, the Rāśis, receiving a Drishti from the Rāśi in Dharm, 
the Rāśi in Karm, the Rāśis, receiving a Drishti from the Rāśi in Karm, the 
Rāśi in Labh and the Rāśis, receiving a Drishti from the Rāśi in Labh. As 
this system is mostly based on Drishtis, it has been named, as Dirga 
Dasha. Three different processes are adopted for the Movable, Fixed and 
Dual Rāśis from Dharm, Karm and Labh. According to them, Rāśi, which receives a Drishti from the Movable Rāśi, is counted backwards and the 
Rāśi, receiving a Drishti from the Fixed Rāśi, is counted onwards. In the 
case of the Dual Rāśi, if it is odd, the counting is onwards and the order is 
backwards in case of an even Rāśi for the Rāśis, receiving a Drishti. 
Notes. The intention is, that from the point of view of Drishti the process of 
Rāśi, receiving a Drishti, should be started from the Rāśi, which is nearest. 
In this connection readers may refer to Rāśi Drishtikathan Adhyaya, Ch. 8, 
Verse 9 and the table after that. 
Lagnadi Rāśi Dasha 
188-189. In this system there are Dashas of all the 12 Rāśis, including 
Lagn, in every Nakshatr. Consequently the Bhayat at birth may be 
multiplied by 12 and then the product should be divided by Bhabhog. The 
Rāśi, degree etc. so available may be added to the longitude of Lagn. From 
the Rāśi, becoming available by doing so, will start the Dashas of the 12 
Rāśis. (If that Rāśi is odd, the counting will be onwards. It will be in the 
reverse order, if the Rāśi is even) 
190. For finding the balance of Dasha at birth, multiply the expired degree 
etc. by the Dasha years of the first Dasha Rāśi and divide it by 30. The 
years etc. so arrived at may be deducted from the Dasha years. The result 
will indicate the balance of Dasha at birth in years, months etc. 
Panch Swar Dasha 
191-194. Beginning from Akaradhi 5 Swaras (a, i, u, e, o), write underneath 
them the Varnas in 6 lines. Leave out the letters „ňa‟ , „ña‟  and „ņa‟, because 
they are not used in names. If they are found in any name, „ga‟  may be 
substituted for „ňa‟ , „ja‟  for „ña‟ and „da‟ for „ņa‟  for working out the Dashas 
and making predictions. In this manner the Swar, under which the first 
Varna of the name of the native is found, will determine the order of the 
Dashas of the five Swaras. Dashas are of 12 years for all the five Swaras. 
In the Dasha of every Swar there will be Antar Dashas of all the five 
Swaras in the same order. 
Yogini 
195-199. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I have already given you the 
description of Panch Swar Dasha. Now I will acquaint you with the Yogini Dasha, as described by Lord Mahadeva. There are 8 Yoginis, namely 
Mangal, Pingal, Dhanya, Bhramari, Bhadrika, Ulka, Siddha and Sankat. 
Candr, Sūrya, Guru, Mangal, Budh, Śani, Śukr and Rahu are born from 
them. Add 3 to the Janm Nakshatr and divide it by 8. The remainder will 
indicate the Yogini Dasha of Mangal, etc. The Dashas are of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7 and 8 years. The balance of Dasha at birth should be worked out from 
the Bhayat and Bhabhog etc., as already explained earlier. 
Pind, Ańś and Nisarg 
201-202. The Pind, Ańś and Nisarg Dasha will be the same, as Pindayu, 
Ańśayu and Nisargayu, the method of determination of which has already 
been explained previously. The order of Dashas will be, as follows. The first 
will be of Lagn, Sūrya, or Candr, whoever is stronger. The subsequent 
Dashas will be of Grahas in Kendr to them, then of Grahas in Panaphara 
Bhavas and lastly in Apoklima Bhavas. The Dashas and Antar Dashas of 
Lagn and the seven Grahas will also be in the same order. 
203. The effects of these Dashas will be in accordance with Ashtak Varg 
Bal, which subject will be dealt with later. These Dashas are also called 
Ashtak Varg Dashas. 
Sandhya 
204. Sandhya is the Dvadashāńś Ayurdaya of the Param Ayurdaya 
(maximum possible life-span). In Sandhya Dasha the Dasha of all the 
Rāśis from Lagn onwards is of 1/12 the years of Param Ayurdaya. 
Pachak Dasha in Sandhya Dasha 
205-206. By multiplying the Dasha years of Sandhya Dasha by 6 and 
dividing the product by 31, the years, months etc. so arrived at may be put 
in one apartment of a Table. Thereafter half of these years, months etc. 
may be written in the next three apartments. The remaining 8 apartments 
may be filled in by one third of the aforesaid years, months etc. In this 
manner Pachak Dasha in Sandhya Dasha of every Bhava can be worked 
out and predictions may be made from it. 
Tar 207-209. O Brahmin! Some sages have given consideration to Tar Dasha, 
which is like Vimshottari. In this Dasha Janm, Sampat etc. in their order 
replace Sūrya, Candr etc., placed in Kendras. This Dasha is applied in 
those cases only, where there are Grahas in Kendras. If there are a 
number of Grahas, the first Dasha will belong to the strongest amongst 
them. 
210. O Brahmin! I have now completed the description of the different kinds 
of Dashas. I will give the description of their Antar Dashas (sub-periods) 
later. 
Ch. 47. Effects of Dashas 
1. Maitreya said. O Maharishi Parashar! You have told me about the 
different kinds of Dashas. Now be kind enough to enlighten me with the 
effects of Dashas. 
2. Maharishi Parashar replied. O Brahmin! There are two kinds of effects of 
Dashas: general and distinctive. The natural characteristics of the Grahas 
cause the general effects and the distinctive effects are realized by their 
placements etc. 
3-4. The effects of the Dashas of the Grahas are in accordance with their 
strength. The effects of a Grah in the first Dreshkan are realized at the 
commencement of the Dasha. The Grah in the second Dreshkan makes its 
effects felt in the middle of the Dasha. The effects of the Grah in the third 
Dreshkan are experienced at the end of the Dasha. If the Grah is 
retrograde, these effects would be in the reverse order. The Dasha effects 
of Rahu and Ketu, who are always retrograde, will always be realized in the 
reverse order. 
5-6. The effects are favourable, if at the commencement of the Dasha the 
Dasha Lord is in Lagn, in his exaltation, own, or a Shant Rāśi. The results 
are unfavourable, if the Dasha Lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, in 
his debilitation, or in an inimical Rāśi. 
7-11. During the Dasha of Sūrya there is acquisition of wealth, great felicity 
and honours from the Government, if at the time of birth Sūrya is in his own 
Rāśi, in his exaltation Rāśi, in a Kendr, in Labh, be associated with the Lord 
of Dharm, or the Lord of Karm and strong in his Varg. The native will be blessed with a son (children), if Sūrya is with the Lord of Putr. The native 
will acquire elephants and other kinds of wealth, if Sūrya is associated with 
the Lord of Dhan. The native will enjoy comforts of conveyances, if Sūrya is 
associated with the Lord of Bandhu. He attains a high position, like that of 
Army Chief, by the beneficence of the king and enjoys all kinds of 
happiness. Thus during the Da sha of a strong (and favourable) Sūrya there 
are acquisitions of clothes, agricultural products, wealth, honours, 
conveyances etc. 
12-15. During the Dasha of Sūrya there will be anxieties, loss of wealth, 
punishment from Government, defamation, opposition by kinsmen, distress 
to father, (in)auspicious happenings at home, distress to paternal and 
maternal uncles etc., anxiety and inimical relations with other people for no 
reason whatsoever, should Sūrya be in his Rāśi of debilitation, be weak in 
Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, or be associated with malefic Grahas, or with the 
Lord of Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya. There will be some favourable effects at 
times, if in the above situations Sūrya receives a Drishti from benefic 
Grahas. The effects will always be unfavourable, when malefic Grahas give 
a Drishti to Sūrya. 
16-22. O Brahmin! After describing the effects of the Dasha of Sūrya in 
brief, I will now come to the effects of Vimshottari Dasha of Candr. During 
the Dasha of Candr from its commencement to the end there will b e 
opulence and glory, good fortune, gain of wealth, auspicious functions at 
home, dawn of fortune, attainment of a high position in Government, 
acquisition of conveyances, clothes, birth of children and acquisition of 
cattle, should Candr be in her exaltation, in her own Rāśi, in Kendr, in 
Labh, Dharm, or Putr, be associated with, or receives a Drishti from 
benefics, be fully powerful and is associated with the Lord of Karm, Dharm, 
or Bandhu. There will be extraordinary gains of wealth and luxuries, if such 
a Candr is in Dhan Bhava. 
23-26. Should Candr be waning, or in her debilitation Rāśi, there will be 
loss of wealth in her Dasha. If Candr is in Sahaj, there will be happiness off 
and on. If Candr is associated with malefics, there will be idiocy, mental 
tension, trouble from employees and mother and loss of wealth. If waning 
Candr is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, or is associated with malefics, there will 
be inimical relations with Government, loss of wealth, distress to mother 
and similar evil effects. If a strong Candr is placed in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya 
there will be troubles and good times off and on. 27-32. If Mangal is in his exaltation, in his Multrikon, in his own Rāśi, in 
Kendr, in Labh, or Dhan Bhava with strength, in a benefic Ańś (Navāńś) 
and is associated with a benefic, there will be during his Dasha acquisition 
of kingdom (attainment of a high administrative, or political position in 
Government, gain of wealth and land, recognition by Government), gain of 
wealth from foreign countries and acquisition of conveyances and 
ornaments. There will also be happiness and good relations with co-borns. 
If Mangal with strength is placed in a Kendr, or in Sahaj, there will be gain 
of wealth through valour, victory over enemies, happiness from wife and 
children. There will, however, be a possibility of some unfavourable effects 
at the end of the Dasha. 
33. If Mangal is in his debilitation Rāśi, weak, in an inauspicious Bhava, or 
is associated with, or receives a Drishti from malefics, there will be in his 
Dasha loss of wealth, distress and similar unfavourable effects. 
34-39½. In order to clarify the effects of the Dasha of Rahu I shall first 
mention the exaltation and debilitation Rāśis of Rahu and Ketu. The 
exaltation Rāśi of Rahu is Vrishabh. The exaltation Rāśi of Ketu is Vrischik. 
The Multrikonas of Rahu and Ketu are Mithun and Dhanu. The own Rāśis 
of Rahu and Ketu are Kumbh and Vrischik. Some sages have expressed 
the view, that Kanya is the own Rāśi of Rahu and Meen is the own Rāśi of 
Ketu. Should Rahu be in his exaltation Rāśi etc., there will be during the 
Dasha of Rahu great happiness from acquisition of wealth, agricultural 
products etc., acquisition of conveyances with the help of friends and 
Government, construction of a new house, birth of sons (children), religious 
inclinations, recognition from Government of foreign countries and gain of 
wealth, clothes etc. If Rahu be associated with, or receives a Drishti from 
benefics, be in a benefic Rāśi and be in Tanu, Bandhu, Yuvati, Karm, Labh, 
or Sahaj, there will be during his Dasha all kinds of comforts by the 
beneficence of the Government, acquisition of wealth through a foreign 
Government, or sovereign and felicity at home. 
40-43. If Rahu is in Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be during his Dasha 
all kinds of troubles and distress. If Rahu is associated with a malefic, or a 
Marak Grah, or is in his debilitation Rāśi, there will be loss of position, 
destruction of his residential house, mental agony, trouble to wife and 
children and misfortune of getting bad food. There will be loss of wealth at 
the commencement of the Dasha, some relief and gain of wealth in his own 
country and distress and anxieties during the last portion of the Dasha. 44. Now I am going to describe the effects of the Dasha of Guru, the great 
benefic and preceptor of the Gods. 
45-48. If Guru is in his exaltation, his own Rāśi, his Multrikon, in Karm, Putr, 
or Dharm Bhava, in his own Navāńś, or in his exalted Navāńś, there will be 
during his Dasha: acquisition of kingdom, great felicity, recognition by 
Government, acquisition of conveyances and clothes, devotion to deities 
and Brahmins, happiness in respect of his wife and children and success in 
the performance of religious sacrifices (oblations). 
49-51. If Guru is in his debilitation Rāśi, combust, associated with malefics, 
or in Ari, or Randhr, there will be during his Dasha loss of residential 
premises, anxiety, distress to children, loss of cattle and pilgrimage. The 
Dasha will give some unfavourable effects at its commencement only. 
During the later part of the Dasha there will be good effects, like gain of 
wealth, awards from and recognition by Government. 
52. Now I will describe to you the effects of the Dasha of Śani, who is 
considered the vilest and most inferior amongst all the Graha s. 
53-56. If Śani is in his exaltation, in his own Rāśi, or in Multrikon, or friendly 
Rāśi, in his own, or exalted Navāńś and in Sahaj, or Labh, there will be 
during his Dasha recognition by Government, opulence and glory, name 
and fame, success in the educational sphere, acquisition of conveyances 
and ornaments etc., gain of wealth, favours from Government, attainment 
of a high position, like Commander of an Army, acquisition of a kingdom, 
benevolence of goddess Lakshmi, gain of property and birth of children. 
57-60. If Śani is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, in his debilitation Rāśi, or 
combust, there will be during his Dasha ill effects from poison, injury from 
weapons, separation from father, distress to wife and children, disaster, as 
a result of displeasure of Government, imprisonment etc. If Śani receives a 
Drishti from, or is associated with a benefic, is placed in a Kendr, or in a 
Trikon, in Dhanu, or in Meen, there will be acquisition of a kingdom, 
conveyances and clothes. 
61. Now I am going to describe the effects of the Dasha of Budh, who is 
called a Kumar (in his teens) amongst all the Grahas. 
62-65. If Budh is in his exaltation, in his own, in a friendly Rāśi, or in Labh, 
Putr, or Dharm, there will be during his Dasha acquisition of wealth, gain of reputation, improvement in knowledge, benevolence of Government, 
auspicious functions, happiness from wife and children, good health, 
availability of sweetish preparations, profits in business etc. If Budh 
receives a Drishti from a benefic, is in Dharm, or is the Lord of Karm, the 
aforesaid beneficial results will be experienced in full and there will be great 
felicity all-round. 
66-70. If Budh is associated with a malefic, there will be during his Dasha 
punishment by Government, inimical relations with kinsmen, journey to a 
foreign country, dependence on others and the possibility of urinary 
troubles. If Budh is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, there will be loss of wealth, 
due to indulgence in lascivious activities, possibility of suffering fro m 
rheumatism and jaundice, danger of thefts and malevolence of 
Government, loss of land and cattle etc. At the commencement of the 
Dasha of Budh, there will be gains of wealth, betterment in the educational 
sphere, birth of children and happiness. In the middle of the Dasha, there 
will be recognition from Government. The last part of the Dasha will be 
distressful. 
71. Now I will tell you about the Dasha of Ketu, who is a headless trunk 
(Kabandha) amongst all the Grahas. 
72-77. If Ketu is in a Kendr, a Trikon, or in Labh, in a benefic Rāśi, in his 
exaltation, or in his own Rāśi, there will be during his Dasha cordial 
relations with the king, desired headship of a country, or village, comforts of 
conveyances, happiness from children, gain from foreign countrie s, 
happiness from wife and acquisition of cattle. If Ketu is in Sahaj, Ari, or 
Labh, there will be in his Dasha acquisition of a kingdom, good relations 
with friends and opportunities for the acquisition of elephants. At the 
commencement of the Ketu Dasha there will be Raj Yog. During the middle 
portion of the Dasha there will be possibilities of fearfulness and in the last 
part there will be sufferings from ailments and journeys to distant places. If 
Ketu is in Dhan, Randhr, or Vyaya, or receives a Drishti from a malefic, 
there will be imprisonment, destruction of kinsmen and residential premises 
and anxieties, company of menials and diseases. 
78. Now I will describe the effects of the Dasha of Śukr, who is the 
incarnate of intoxication, ecstasy, delight and pride amongst all the Grahas. 79-82. If Śukr is in his exaltation, in his own Rāśi, or in a Kendr, or a Trikon, 
there will be during his Dasha acquisition of fancy clothes, ornaments, 
conveyances, cattle and land etc., availability of sweet preparations every 
day, recognition from the sovereign, luxurious functions of songs and 
dances etc. by the benevolence of Goddess Lakshmi. If Śukr is in his 
Multrikon, during his Dasha there will definitely be acquisition of a kingdom, 
acquisition of a house, birth of children and grandchildren, celebration of 
marriage in the family, attainment of a high position, like the Commander of 
an Army, visits of friends, recovery of lost wealth, property, or kingdom. 
83-84½. If Śukr is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, there will be during his Dasha 
inimical relations with kinsmen, distress to wife, losses in business, 
destruction of cattle and separation from relations. 
85-87. If Śukr is in Bandhu, as Lord of Dharm, or Karm, there will be during 
his Dasha attainment of rulership of a country, or village, performance of 
pious deeds, like building of reservoirs and temples and giving grains etc. 
in charity, availability of sweet preparations every day, vigor in work, name 
and fame and happiness from wife and children. 
88-89. Similar are the effects of Śukr in his sub-periods. If Śukr is Lord of 
Dhan, or Yuvati, there will be during his Dasha physical pains and troubles. 
To get alleviation from those troubles the native should perform 
Shatarudriya, or Mrityunjaya Japa in the prescribed manner and give in 
charity a cow, or female buffalo. 
Ch. 48. Distinctive Effects of the Nakshatr Dasha, or of 
the Dashas of the Lords (Vimshottari) of various 
Bhavas 
1. If the Lord of Karm is placed in an auspicious Bhava in his exaltation 
Rāśi etc., his Dasha effects will be favourable. The effects will be adverse, 
if the Lord of Karm is in his debilitation Rāśi and occupies an inauspicious 
Bhava. This proves, that an inauspicious Grah in his exaltation Rāśi etc. 
will not produce unfavourable results, if placed in an auspicious Bhava and 
a benefic, being in his debilitation Rāśi and being placed in an inauspicious 
Bhava, will produce adverse effects. Now I will describe the effects of the 
Dasha of the Lords of various Bhavas, who are related to each other. 2-4. There will be physical well-being in the Dasha of the Lord of Lagn, 
distress and possibility of death in the Dasha of the Lord of Dhan, 
unfavourable effects in the Dasha of the Lord of Sahaj, acquisition of house 
and land in the Dasha of the Lord of Bandhu, progress in educational 
sphere and happiness from the children in the Dasha of the Lord of Putr 
and danger from enemies and ill health in the Dasha of the Lord of Ari. 
5-8. There will be distress to wife and the possibility of the death of the 
native in the Dasha of the Lord of Yuvati, the possibility of death and 
financial losses in the Dasha of the Lord of Randhr, improvement in the 
educational sphere, religious-mindedness and unexpected gains of wealth 
in the Dasha of the Lord of Dharm, recognition from and awards by the 
Government in the Dasha of the Lord of Karm, obstacles in gains of wealth 
and the possibility of diseases in the Dasha of the Lord of Labh and 
distress and danger from diseases in the Dasha of the Lord of Vyaya. A 
Grah, placed in an auspicious Bhava, like Trikon etc., at the 
commencement of the Dasha, produces favourable results in his Dasha. 
The Grah, placed in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya at that time, yields only adverse 
results during his Dasha. It is therefore essential, that the placement of a 
Grah at the time of birth and at the commencement of the Dasha should 
both be taken into account for the assessment of the Dasha effects. 
14-17½. The Dasha of Ari‟s, Randhr‟s, or Vyaya‟s Lord also becomes 
favourable, if they get associated with the Lord of a Trikon. If the Lord of a 
Kendr is in a Trikon, or the Lord of a Trikon is in a Kendr, the Dasha of the 
Grah, yuti with either of them, becomes favourable. The Dasha of a Grah, 
receiving a Drishti from the Lord of a Kendr, or Trikon is also favourable. If 
Dharm‟s Lord is in Lagn and Lagn‟s Lord is in Dharm, the Dashas of both of 
them will produce extremely beneficial results. There will be acquisition of a 
kingdom in the Dashas of Lagn‟s Lord and Karm‟s Lord, if Karm‟s Lord is in 
Lagn and Lagn‟s Lord is in Karm. 
18-20. The Dasha of Sahaj‟s, Ari‟s and Labh‟s Lord, of the Grahas, placed 
in Sahaj, Ari and Labh and of the Grahas, yuti with the above, will prove 
unfavourable. The Dasha of the Grahas, associated with the Lords of 
Marak Bhavas, namely Dhan and Yuvati, in Dhan, or Yuvati and the 
Dashas of the Grahas, placed in Randhr, will produce unfavourable effects. 
Thus the Dashas should be considered favourable, after taking into 
account the placement of a Grah and his relationship of one Grah with the 
other. (Rahu and Ketu give favourable results in Sahaj, Ari and Labh). Ch. 49. Effects of the Kaal Chakr 
1-5. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I am now going to describe to 
you the effects of the Kaal Chakr Dasha. 
During the Dasha of the Rāśi, owned, or occupied by Sūrya, there will be ill 
health, due to the blood, or bile troubles; … Candr, there will be gain of 
wealth and clothes, name and fame and birth of children; … Mangal, there 
will be bilious fever, gout and wounds; … Budh, there will be acquisition of 
wealth and birth of children; … Guru, there will be increase in the number 
of children, acquisition of wealth and enjoyment; … Śukr, there will be 
acquisition of learning, marriage and gain of wealth; … occupied by Śani, 
there will be all kinds of adverse happenings. 
The Effects of the Dashas on the Basis of the Navāńś of each Rāśi 
6-7. In the Kaal Chakr Dasha of Mesh in Mesh Navāńś there will be 
distress, due to troubles, caused by the pollution of blood. In the Dasha of 
Mesh in the Navāńś of Vrishabh there will be increase in wealth and 
agricultural product. In the Navāńś of Mithun there will be advancement of 
knowledge. In the Navāńś of Kark there will be acquisition of wealth, in the 
Simh Navāńś danger from enemies, in the Kanya distress to wife, in the 
Tula kingship, in the Vrischik death and in the Dhanu acquisition of wealth. 
Such will be the effects of the 9 Padas of Mesh. In assessing the net 
effects the nature of the Grah, occupying the Rāśi, should also be taken 
into account.  
8-10. In the Dasha of Makar Navāńś in Vrishabh there will be tendency to 
perform undesirable deeds along with more adverse effects. In the Kumbh 
Navāńś there will be profits in business, in the Meen success in all 
ventures, in the Dasha of Vrischik Navāńś danger from fire, in the Dasha of 
Tula Navāńś recognition from Government and reverence from all, in the 
Dasha of Kanya Navāńś danger from enemies, in the Dasha of Kark 
Navāńś distress to wife, in the Dasha of Simh Navāńś diseases of eyes 
and in the Dasha of Mithun Navāńś obstacles in earning livelihood. Such 
will be the effects of the 9 Navāńśas of Vrishabh. Similar interpretation 
should be made of further verses on this subject. 
11-12. In Mithun in the Dasha of the Vrishabh Ańś there will be acquisition 
of wealth, in the Dasha of Mesh Ańś attacks of fever, in the Dasha of Meen Ańś affectionate relations with maternal uncle, in the Dasha of Kumbh Ańś

of learning and wealth, … Makar danger from water, … Kumbh increase in 
the production of agricultural products and in the Dasha of the Meen Ańś 
acquisition of more wealth and enjoyment. 
16-17. In Simh in the Dasha of the Navāńś of Vrischik there will be distress 
and disputes, … Tula extraordinary gains, … Kanya gains of wealth, … 
Kark danger from wild animals, … Simh birth of a son, … Mithun increase 
of enemies, … Vrishabh gains from sale of cattle, … Mesh danger from 
animals and in the Dasha of Meen Ańś journeys to distant places. 
18-19. In Kanya in the Dasha of Kumbh Ańś there will be acquisition of 
wealth, … Makar financial gains, … Dhanu mingling with kinsmen, … Mesh 
happiness from m other, … Vrishabh birth of children, … Mithun increase in 
enemies, … Kark love with some woman, … Simh aggravation of diseases 
and in the Dasha of Kanya Ańś birth of children. 
20-22. In Tula in the Dasha of Tula Ańś there will be financial gains, … 
Vrischik good relations with kinsmen, … Dhanu happiness from father, … 
Makar disputes with mother, … Kumbh birth of a son and financial gains, … 
Meen entanglement with enemies, … Vrischik disputes with women, … 
Tula danger from water and in Dasha of Kanya Ańś more financial gains. 
23-24½. In Vrischik in the Dasha of Kark Ańś there will be financial gains, 
… Simh opposition to the king, … Mithun acquisition of land, … Vrishabh 
financial gains, … Mesh danger from reptiles, … Meen danger from water, 
… Kumbh profits in business, … Makar profits in business, … Makar 
possibility of suffering from diseases and in the Dasha of Dhanu Ańś 
financial gains. 
25-27. In Dhanu in the Dasha of Mesh Ańś there will be financial gains, … 
Vrishabh acquisition of more land, … Mithun success in ventures, … Kark 
success all round, … Simh increase in the accumulated wealth, … Kanya disputes, … Tula financial gains, … Vrischik affliction with diseases, … 
Dhanu happiness from children. 
28-29. In Makar in the Dasha of Makar Ańś there will be happiness from 
children, … Kumbh gain of agricultural products, … Meen well being, … 
Vrischik danger from poison, … Tula financial gains, … Kanya increase in

30-32. In Kumbh in the Dasha of Vrishabh Ańś there will be financial gains, 
… Mesh diseases of the eyes, … Meen journeys to distant places, … 
Kumbh increase in wealth, … Makar success in all kinds of ventures, … 
Dhanu more enemies, … Mesh loss of happiness and enjoyment, …

33-34½. In the Meen in the Dasha of Kark Ańś there will be increase in 
wealth, … Simh recognition by Government, … Kanya financial gains, … 
Tula gains from all sources, … Vrischik fever, … Dhanu more enemies, … 
Makar conjugal disputes, … Kumbh danger from water and in the Dasha of 
Meen Ańś good fortune all-round. In this manner on the Kaal Chakr, 
prepared on the basis of Pad of the Janm Nakshatr, the Dashas of the 
Navāńś Rāśis and their duration can be assessed and prediction can be 
made for the whole life of the native. Appropriate remedial measures 
(recitation of Mantras, oblations etc.) should be taken to alleviate the 
adverse effects, caused by malefic Dashas. 
35-37. The effects of Dasha in Raj Yog etc. have already been described in 
Vol. I of this book. The same should be applied in a judicious manner in the 
Kaal Chakr. These are in brief effects of Kaal Chakr Dasha. 
Ch. 50. Effects of the Char etc. Dashas 
1-3. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I have already described the 
Char etc. Dashas. Now I am going to tell you the effects of these Dashas. 
The effects of the Dashas of the Rāśis should be judged from the strength 
of the Lords of Rāśis and whether they are benefics, or malefics. If the Lord 
of a Rāśi possesses full strength, the effects of the Dasha of the Rāśi will 
be realized in full. The effects of the Dasha will be of medium nature, if the 
strength is medium. If the Lord of Rāśi possesses little strength, the effects 
will be experienced accordingly. 4-10. If there are malefics in the 8th, the 5th and the 9th from a Dasha Rāśi, 
the effects of the Dasha of that Rāśi will be distressful. If there are malefics 
in the 3rd and the 6th from a Dasha Rāśi, the effects of the Dasha will be 
victory over enemies and happiness. If there are benefics in the 3rd and the 
6th from the Dasha Rāśi, there will be defeat in its Dasha. If there are 
benefics, or malefics in the 11th from the Dasha Rāśi, there will be 
conquests and happiness in the Dasha. If the Dasha Rāśi is occupied by, 
or is owned by a benefic, the effects of its Dasha will be beneficial. If a 
Dasha Rāśi, owned by a benefic, is occupied by a malefic, favourable 
effects will be experienced in the first part of the Dasha and they will be 
adverse in the latter part. If a Dasha Rāśi, owned by a malefic is occupied 
by a benefic, the effects of the Dasha will be the same. A Dasha Rāśi, 
owned and occupied by a malefic will always yield unfavourable results. 
The reverse will be the case in the case of the Dasha Rāśi, owned and 
occupied by a benefic. If a Dasha Rāśi, owned by a benefic, is occupied by 
both benefic and malefic Grahas, the effects of Dasha will be adverse in its 
first part and favourable in the latter part. 
11-17. The assessment of the effects of the Dasha of the Dasha Rāśi 
should be made after taking into account the disposition of the Grahas in 
the Rāśi at birth and the disposition of Grahas during the Dasha. If the 
Dasha Rāśi is well disposed both at the time of birth and during its Dasha, 
the beneficial results will be realized in full. If it is ill-disposed during the 
Dasha, the effects will be of mixed nature. If the Dasha Rāśi is ill-disposed 
both at the time of birth and during its Dasha, only evil effects will be 
experienced. 
18-19. The effects of the Dasha will be favourable, if it is occupied by a 
benefic and there is also a benefic in the Rāśi previous to it. If the Rāśi is 
occupied by a malefic, the effects will be of adverse nature. If there are 
benefics in Putr and Dharm, the effects of its Dasha will be favourable. The 
reverse will be the case, if Putr and Dharm are occupied by malefics. 
20-21. Kumbh, Vrishabh, Simh and Vrischik are Badhak Bhavas for the 
four Movable Rāśis: Mesh, Kark, Tula and Makar. In other words the 11th 
Rāśi to a Movable Rāśi is its Badhak Bhava. If there is a malefic in the 
Bhava, occupied by its Lord, or in Badhak Bhava of that Rāśi, there will be 
occasions of great sorrow, imprisonment and diseases during the Dasha. 22. The Dasha of a Rāśi will be favourable, if it is occupied by its own Lord, 
or an exalted Grah. The Dasha of a Rāśi, not occupied by any Grah, will be 
adverse. 
23-25. There will be great danger, imprisonment during a journey, 
displeasure of Government and danger from enemies in the Dasha and 
Antar Dasha of the Rāśi, from which its Badhak Bhava, Vyaya, Ari and 
Randhr are occupied by Rahu. There will be loss, due to the displeasure of 
the king and danger therefrom in the Antar Dasha of the Rāśi, that is 
occupied by Sūrya, Mangal, Rahu and Śani. There will be the possibility of 
death, if the 5th and the 9th from the Antar Dasha Rāśi are occupied by a 
debilitated, or malefic Grah. 
26-28. There will be enjoyment, acquisition of chiefship of a town, or 
village, birth of a son, financial gains, well-being, dawn of fortune, 
attainment of the position of a Commander of an Army and progress all-
round, if there is an exalted Grah in the Trikon from the Antar Dasha Rāśi. 
There will be in his Dasha financial gains, well-being and birth of a son, if 
the Grah, who is the Lord of the Dasha, happens to be in a benefic Rāśi 
and receives a Drishti from Guru. 
29-32. Vrishabh, Tula, Makar, Kumbh and Mithun are the inimical Rāśis of 
Sūrya. The inimical Rāśis of Candr and other Grahas may be reckoned 
similarly. If a Grah is in an inimical Rāśi, his Dasha will be full of 
adversities. The effects of the Dasha of Rāśis and Grahas should be 
judged after taking into account the above rules. 
33-34. The Dashas of that Grah will be favourable, who is Raj Yog Karak, 
who is disposed between two benefics (that is there are benefics in the 2nd 
and the 12th Bhavas to that Grah) and who has benefics in the 2nd, 3rd and 
4th Bhavas from him. A malefic Grah becomes favourable, if he is disposed 
between benefics. 
35-36. The whole of the Dasha of a Grah, who is related to a friendly and 
benefic Grah at the commencement and the end of the Dasha, will be 
favourable. In an unfavourable Dasha the Antar Dasha of a benefic (Grah, 
or Rāśi) becomes favourable. The Dasha of a Grah, or Rāśi, who has 
benefics in the 5th, or the 9th from it, is also favourable. In this manner the 
effects of the Dasha should be judged, after taking into account the dispositions of the Grah, or Rāśi at the commencement and at the end of 
the Dasha. 
37-39. The Dasha of the Grahas and Rāśis, who have benefics in the 
Trikon from them is favourable. If the Dasha of a benefic Rāśi commences 
in a benefic Rāśi, it will be very favourable. If an evil Dasha commences in 
a benefic Rāśi, it is also favourable. Therefore the commencement of a 
Dasha should always be kept in view in assessing the results of the Dasha. 
There will be loss of fortune, if at the commencement of the Dasha there is 
a malefic Rāśi, or, if the Lord of the Dasha Rāśi is in debilitation. 
40-41. There will be loss of fortune, wealth and agricultural products and 
infliction with disease during the Dasha of the Rāśi, occupied by a 
debilitated Grah, or, if there is a debilitated Grah in the 5th from it, or in the 
9th from it, or whose Lord is debilitated, or related to a debilitated Grah. 
42. Four Rāśis from Kumbh and four Rāśis from Vrischik belong to Rahu 
and Ketu, respectively. If Rahu and Ketu are in any one of the aforesaid 
Rāśis, the Dasha will be productive of beneficial results. 
43-45. If a Grah, whose Dasha is otherwise considered favourable, is 
placed in a Marak Bhava, or, if the Rāśi, in which his Dasha comes to an 
end, receives a Drishti from Śukr, or Candr, there will be in his Dasha 
displeasure of government and loss of wealth. 
46-47. There will be loss of everything, imprisonment, death, exile from the 
country and great distress at the end of the Dasha of Rahu. The above 
effects will definitely be realized, if there are malefics in the 5th and the 9th 
from Rahu. Beneficial and adverse effects should be predicted in this 
manner. 
48-50. The same would be the effects in the Dasha of the Rāśi, occupied 
by malefics, like Rahu etc. The association of a Marak Grah with the Rāśi 
at the time of commencement of its Dasha is not productive of good effects. 
If such a Grah is Rahu, there will be imprisonment, or loss of wealth. 
51-52. The natural characteristics of the Bhava, occupied by Rahu, are 
harmed at the commencement of the Dasha. If such a Bhava is Dhan, 
there will be loss of wealth. If Candr and Śukr are in Vyaya, there will be 
losses, due to the displeasure of government. If Mangal and Ketu are so 
disposed, there will be death, or danger from fire. There will be acquisition of a kingdom, if Śukr and Candr are in Dhan at the commencement of the 
Dasha. This means, that the effects of the Bhava, in which Candr and Śukr 
are placed at the commencement and end of a Dasha, are strengthened. 
Thus their disposition in Ari, Randhr and Vyaya will produce only adverse 
effects. 
53-55. Similarly the sages have described the effects of the Bhava with 
Argal. If there is an auspicious Argal causing benefic, or malefic Grah of a 
Rāśi and Lagn receives a Drishti from him, that Rāśi will prevail. Here Lagn 
is the secondary condition. If the Grah, causing uninterrupted Argal, gives a 
Drishti to a Rāśi, that Rāśi will prevail. In other words good effects will be 
derived in the Dasha of that Rāśi. The Dasha of the Rāśi, which does not 
receive a Drishti from an auspicious Argal, or the Dasha of a Rāśi with 
Vipreet Argal will not be favourable. The Dasha of that Rāśi, which receives 
a Drishti from a benefic, will be favourable. 
56-59. Financial gains will be derived in the Dasha of the Rāśi, which is 
occupied by its benefic Lord, or by an exalted Grah, who receives a Drishti 
from him. There will be loss of wealth, if such a Grah is in the 12th Bhava to 
the Rāśi (or Bhava). There will be destruction of all good effects, distress to 
children and father and mental agony in the Dasha of the Rāśi, if there are 
malefics in the 5th and the 9th from the Rāśi. Evil effects will be experienced 
in the Dasha of the Rāśi, which is occupied by Randhr‟s Lord, Vyaya‟s 
Lord, Sūrya, Mangal, or Śani. 
60-63. The Dasha of the Rāśi will cause distress to children, exile to a 
foreign country and continuous disturbances in life, if Rahu and Ketu are in 
the Trikon to the Rāśi. There will be danger from enemies, from the king 
and disease in the Dasha of the Rāśi, which is so posited, that the 6th and 
the 8th from it are occupied by malefic, debilitated, or combust Grahas. 
There will be destruction of house, land and agricultural fields, if there is a 
malefic, or debilitated Grah in the 4th from the Rāśi. There will be loss of 
house, due to negligence, if such a Grah is Mangal. There will be heart 
pain and danger from government, if the Grah is Śani and there will be 
losses all round and danger from poison and thieves, if the Grah is Rahu. 
64-66½. There will be pilgrimage to holy places in the Dasha of the Rāśi, 
who has Rahu in the 10th to it. There will be gain of earnings, religious rites, 
gain of wealth, renown for good deeds and success in efforts and ventures 
in the Dasha of the Rāśi, which is so posited, that the 10th, the 11th and the 9th from it are occupied by benefics. There will be birth of children, 
happiness from wife and recognition by the Government in the Dasha of 
the Rāśi, from which the 5th, the 7th and the 9th are occupied by benefic, or 
exalted Grahas. During the Dasha of the Bhavas (Rāśis), occupied by 
Putr‟s, Labh‟s, Karm‟s, Bandhu‟s, Dharm‟s and Lagn‟s Lord, there will be 
growth of these Bhavas. The good effects will be in proportion to the 
strength of the Bhavas and the Grahas, occupying them. 
67-70. In the Dasha of a Rāśi (Bhava) there will be well-being, increase in 
opulence and glory and devotion to deities and Brahmins, if it is occupied 
by Guru, Śukr, or the Lord of a Trikon. There will be acquisition of more 
conveyances and cattle etc. in the Dasha of the Rāśi (Bhava), which is so 
posited, that the 4th from it is occupied by an exalted Grah, or Lord of a 
Trikon. Candr there will give things, like grains, Ghī etc. Full Candr will 
favour with a treasure and jewels etc. Śukr there, will provide enjoyment 
from music etc. 
71-72. There will be enjoyment of the palanquin-like conveyance in the 
Dasha of the Rāśi (Bhava), from which the 4th is occupied by Guru. There 
will be success in all ventures, great opulence and glory, acquisition of a 
kingdom during the Dasha of a Rāśi (Bhava), which has the Yog of the 
Lord of Lagn, Dharm‟s Lord, Karm‟s Lord, an exalted Grah, or benefics. 
The effects of the Dashas of various Bhavas should be judged in this 
manner. 
73-77. The effects of the Dashas of each Rāśi, or Grah (Nakshatr Dasha) 
depend on their 18 different kinds of conditions. They are deep exaltation, 
exaltation, dispositions on their either side, Multrikon, own, Adhimitr, 
Tatkalik Mitra‟s, neutral, enemy‟s, Adhisatru‟s Rāśi, deep debilitation, 
debilitated, or enemy‟s Varg, own Varg, disposition in a Kendr, disposition 
in a Trikon, defeated in war between Grahas, deep combustion. 
78-83½. Acquisition of kingdom, enjoyment and acquisition of more 
property are the effects of the whole Dasha of the Grah, who is in deep 
exaltation and is fully equipped with all the six kinds of strength, great 
opulence and glory with some possibility of affliction with disease are the 
effects of the Grah, placed in his Rāśi of exaltation. The Dasha of a Grah in 
deep debilitation is called Rikt. Diseases, loss of wealth and danger of 
death are the effects of the Dasha of such a Grah. The Dasha of the Grah, 
who is in a condition in between deep exaltation and deep debilitation is known, as Avrohini (descending). The Dasha of the Grah in exaltation, or in 
a friend‟s Rāśi is called Madhya (of middle order). This Dasha also yields 
moderately good effects. The Dasha of a Grah, placed in a condition in 
between deep debilitation and deep exaltation, is called Rohini (ascending). 
The Dasha of a Grah, placed in between the debilitated and enemy Navāńś 
is called Adham (evil). Dangers of various kinds, distress and sorrows are 
the results of the Dasha of such a Grah. These Dashas give results, 
according to their nomenclature. 
84-87. The Dashas of other Grahas become auspicious and augment the 
fortune, if the Lord of Dharm and Guru are in any way related with Yog, 
Kendr, or the Bhava concerned etc. The Grah with Yog of good fortune at 
birth produces good effects, when he is free from retrogression and 
becomes direct. The weakness, inabilities and Yogas of other Grahas 
should also be taken into account in judging their effects. All those Dashas 
give full, medium and little effects in accordance with the disposition of the 
Grahas in the Kendr, Panaphara and Apoklima. 
88-89½. The Grahas in Shirshodaya, Ubhayodaya and Prishthodaya Rāśis, 
yield their results, respectively, at the commencement, in the middle and at 
the end of the Dasha. All the Grahas yield auspicious results in the Antar 
Dasha of Naisargik (natural, constant) and Tatkalik (according to position) 
friends. The results will be adverse in the Antar Dasha of inimical Grahas. 
Antar Dashas of Rāśis 
90-96. There are Antar Dashas of the 12 Rāśis, commencing from the 
Rāśi, in which the Lord of the Dasha is placed. There will be auspicious 
results, like acquisition of kingdom in the Antar Dasha of a Rāśi, which is 
occupied by its own Lord, or a friendly Grah. There will be inauspicious 
results, like loss of wealth, disputes, danger from diseases etc. in the Antar 
Dasha of the Rāśi, which may be Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, or is occupied by a 
malefic, debilitated Grah, or a Grah, placed in an inimical Rāśi. The Rāśi, 
which contained more auspicious marks in the Ashtak Varg will yield 
benefic effects in its Antar Dasha. Adverse will be the effects of the Antar 
Dasha of the Rāśi, which contains more inauspicious marks. For assessing 
the results the Rāśi, from which the Dasha commences, should be treated, 
as Lagn and the Bhavas thereafter should be assumed to have the 
characteristics, as if they are so from Lagn. Thus the 2nd Bhava from that 
Rāśi will be the Bhava of the wealth, the 3rd of co-borns and so on. There will be gains, or losses of Dhatus etc., assigned to the Rāśis and the 
Grahas, in the Antar Dasha of the Rāśis concerned. In judging the effects 
of the Antar Dashas of the Grahas their benefic and malefic nature, 
relations with the malefic, or benefic, Drishtis on them and their disposition 
in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya etc. should all be kept in view. 
97. The results of the Antar Dasha‟s Pratyantar Dashas of the Rāśis should 
be assessed in the manner, explained in this chapter. 
Ch. 51. Working out of Antar Dashas of Grahas and 
Rāśis in Vimshottari etc. Dasha systems 
1. For finding out the span of the Antar Dasha of a Grah in the Dasha of the 
same, or another Grah multiply the Dasha years of the former with the 
Dasha years of the latter and divide the product by the total Dasha years of 
all the Grahas. For finding out the span of the Pratyantar Dasha of the 
same, or any other Grah in the Antar Dasha of another Grah multiply the 
years etc. of the Antar Dasha with the Dasha years of the other Grah and 
divide the product by the total Dasha years of all the Grahas. The figure so 
available in months etc. will represent the Pratyantar Dasha of the former. 
2. In every Dasha the first Antar Dasha belongs to the Lord of the Dasha. 
Then the further Antar Dashas belong to the other 8 Grahas in the same 
order, as followed for the Dashas. The same applies to Pratyantar Dasha. 
The Antar Dashas of Char Grahas in Char etc. Dasha 
3-4. The Antar Dashas of the Charadi Kendradi Dasha of the Grahas are 
worked out by dividing the Dasha years by 9. The first Dasha will invariably 
be of the Lord of the Dasha. Thereafter there will be Antar Dashas of 
Grahas, placed in Kendras, Panapharas and Apoklimas, respectively, 
according to their strength. 
Antar Dashas of Rāśis 
5. The Antar Dashas of Rāśis is worked out by dividing the Dasha years by 
12. Pratyantar Dashas of the Antar Dashas are also calculated in the same 
manner. 6. The Antar Dashas will start from the Dasha Rāśi, or from the Rāśi 7th 
therefrom, whichever is stronger. The Antar Dashas are in the onwards 
order, if the Dasha Rāśi is odd and in the reverse order, if it is ev en. 
7-12. O Brahmin! Now I will acquaint you with the special characteristics of 
the order of the Antar Dashas of the Rāśis. If the Dasha Rāśi is a Movable 
one, the Antar Dashas of the 12 Rāśis are in the onwards, or reverse order. 
If the Dasha Asraya Rāśi is a Fixed one, the Antar Dashas will start from it 
and thereafter there will be an Antar Dasha of every sixth Rāśi. If the 
Dasha Ashraya Rāśi is a Dual one, the first Antar Dasha will belong to it. 
Thereafter there will be Antar Dashas of Rāśis in Kendr to it, Rāśis in Kendr 
to the 5th from it and Rāśis in Kendr to the 9th from it. In the case of all kinds 
of Rāśis, namely Movable, Fixed, or Dual, the order will be onwards, if the 
Dasha Asraya Rāśi is an odd one and in the reverse order, if it is an even 
one. The so called Dasha Asraya Rāśi is known, as Pak Rāśi. In the first 
order Rāśi, which is Pak Rāśi, is also called Bhog Rāśi. Later, if the Dasha 
Prad Rāśi is even, then the Bhog Rāśi will be that, which is at the same 
Rāśi distance, as the Dasha Asraya Rāśi is from the Dasha Prad Rāśi. For 
the Char, Sthir and Trikon Dasha, the Pak and Bhog should be determined 
in this manner. If Pak and Bhog Rāśis are associated with malefics, there 
will be pain in the body and mental agony. There will be enjoyment, if they 
are associated with benefics. In the Kaal Chakr Dasha, like the Vimshottari 
Dasha system, the span of Dasha should be multiplied by the span of the 
Dasha of the Rāśi, whose Antar Dasha is required and the product should 
be divided by the total Dasha years of (all) the Rāśi(s). The years, months 
etc. as arrived at will represent the Antar Dasha of the Rāśi concerned. 
13-16. Now I will tell you the method of working out the Antar Dashas in the 
Pinda, Ańś and Nisarg Dashas. The Lord of Dasha is Dasha Pachak of full 
part, the Grah, associated with, is Pachak of ½ part, the Grah in Trikon 
from him is Pachak of l/3 part and the Grah in the 4th and 8th from him are 
Pachak of ¼ part, the Grah in the 7th from him is Pachak of l/7 part of the 
Dasha. No Grah in any other Bhava is Antar Dash Pachak. In this manner 
there are Antar Dasha Pachakas in the above-mentioned Bhavas from the 
various Bhavas, including Lagn. In any of such Bhavas, if there are more 
than one Grah, then the one, who is the strongest amongst them will be the 
Pachak. Take the fractions and reduce them in equivalent fractions with a 
common denominator. Add up the aliquot parts of the Dasha, 
representative of the various numerators, leaving out the denominators. 
The Antar Dashas will be arrived at, when the various aliquots are converted into years, months etc. within the main Dasha and divided by the 
above sum. (The calculations, given above, are not the literal translation of 
the text in the verses concerned, but their actual meaning and sense. This 
has been got confirmed by checking up with similar information, given in 
Kalyana Varma‟s Saravali and Varamihir‟s Brihat Jatak) 
Ch. 52. Effects of the Antar Dashas in the Dasha of 
Sūrya (Vimshottari) 
1-3. Good effects, like acquisition of wealth and grains etc., are derived in 
the Antar Dasha of Sūrya in his own Dasha, if Sūrya is exalted, in his own 
Bhava, in Labh, in a Kendr, or in a Trikon. Adverse results will be 
experienced, if Sūrya is debilitated, or in an inauspicious Bhava, or Rāśi. 
Medium effects will be realized, if Sūrya is in other houses. If Sūrya is the 
Lord of Dhan, or Yuvati, there will be danger of premature death, or death-
like sufferings. The remedial measures to be adopted are Mrityunjaya Japa, 
or the worship of Sūrya (by recitation of appropriate Mantras, charity etc.). 
4-6. Functions, like marriage etc., gain of wealth and property, acquisition 
of a house, of land, cattle and conveyances etc. will be the effects of the 
Antar Dasha of Candr in the Dasha of Sūrya, if Candr is in a Kendr, or in a 
Trikon. There will be marriage of the native, birth of children, beneficence of 
and favours from kings and fulfillment of all ambitions, if Candr is in his 
exaltation Rāśi, or in his own Rāśi. 
7-10. Distress to wife and children, failures in ventures, disputes with 
others, loss of servants, antagonism with the king and destructions of 
wealth and grains will be the effects, if Candr is waning, or is associated 
with malefics. Effects, like danger from water, mental agony, imprisonment, 
danger from diseases, loss of position, journeys to difficult places, disputes 
with coparceners, bad food, trouble from thieves etc., displeasure of the 
king, urinary troubles, pains in the body will be experienced, if Candr is in

increase in the enjoyment from wife and children, acquisition of kingdom, 
performance of marriage and religious functions, gain of garments, land

the effects in the Antar Dasha, if Candr is in the 6th, the 8th, or the 12th from 
the Lord of the Dasha, or, if Candr is weak. There will be premature death, 
if Candr is the Lord of a Marak Bhava. To acquire peace and comfort, the 
remedial measure is giving in charity of a white cow and a female buffalo 
(Mahishi). 
15-18. Auspicious effects, like acquisition of land, gain of wealth and 
grains, acquisition of a house etc. will be derived in the Antar Dasha of 
Mangal in the Dasha of Sūrya, if Mangal is in his exaltation Rāśi, in his own 
Rāśi, in a Kendr, or in a Trikon. All-round gains, attainment of the position

or, if Mangal is without dignity and strength. 
21-22. Destruction of wealth by the displeasure of the king will be the 
effect, if Mangal is in his debilitation Rāśi, or be weak. Diseases of the mind 
and body will result, if Mangal is the Lord of Dhan, or Yuvati Bhava. 
Recovery from ill health, increase in longevity and success in adventures 
are possible, if remedial measure, like recitation of Vedas, Japa and 
Vrashotsarg are performed in the prescribed manner. 
23-26½. In the Antar Dasha of Rahu in the Dasha of Sūrya, if Rahu is in a 
Kendr, or in a Trikon from Lagn, there will be in the first two months loss of 
wealth, danger from thieves, snakes, infliction of wounds and distress to 
wife and children. After 2 months inauspicious effects will disappear and 
enjoyment and comforts, sound health, satisfaction, favours from the king 
and government etc. will be the favourable effects, if Rahu is yuti with 
benefics, or, if Rahu is in the Navāńś of a benefic. Recognition from the

30-31. Adverse effects, like premature death and danger from snakes will 
be derived, if Rahu is in Dhan, or Yuvati, or, if Rahu is associated with the

of the Antar Dasha, some good effects in the middle part of the Antar 
Dasha and the possibility of displeasure of the king and exile to a foreign 
country at the end of the Dasha. If Budh is the Lord of Dhan, or Yuvati, 
there will be pains in the body and attacks of fever. For relief from the evil effects and to regain good health and happiness the remedial measures 
are the recitation of Vishnu Sahasranam and giving in charity grains and an 
idol, made of silver. 
58-59. Body pains, mental agony, loss of wealth, danger from the king,

56-58. Maharishi Parashar said to Maitreya. O Brahmin! The effects of 
Antar Dashas in the Kala Chakr, which have been described above, are 
based on Savya Chakr. The effects of Antar Dashas in the Dashas of the 
Rāśis in the Apsavya Chakr have to be assessed, after taking into account 
the benefic and malefic natures of the Lords of the Rāśis. People have to 
enjoy the good, or suffer the bad results, according to their good, or bad 
actions in the previous births. Everybody suffers, or enjoys accordingly. 
The peculiarity in this respect is, that inauspicious results have been 
ascribed to malefics. But, if during the Antar Dasha the Grah concerned is 
a friend of the Lord of the Dasha, the results of the Antar Dasha will be 
favourable. If the Grah concerned is a benefic, but an enemy of the Lord of 
the Dasha, his Antar Dasha effects will not prove favourable. This is how 
the Antar Dasha effects have to be analyzed and conclusions arrived at.

32. There is no doubt, that observance of remedial measures in the form of 
prescribed Maharishi Yagyas destroys the evil effects of the inauspicious 
Dashas and yield happiness. 
Ch. 66. AshtakaVarg 
1-4. Maitreya said: “O Venerable Sage! You have described many kinds of 
effects, relating to the Grahas and Bhavas, after incorporating the views of 
many sages and Acharyas, but it is not possible to say with certainty, if a 
particular effect is quite correct, after considering the contradictions in the 
effects by the movements of the various Grahas. As because of sinful 
deeds, committed by people in Kaliyuga, their minds have become blunt, 
be kind enough to describe a method, which would enable even the 
shallow minded persons to ascertain their happiness and sorrows and 
determine their longevity on the basis of the positions of the Grahas in 
transit.” 
5-6. The sage replied: “O Brahmin! You have put a very intelligent question. 
I will now describe the Shastra for the benefit of all, the Shastra, in which 
there will be no contradictions in judging the effects of happiness and 
sorrows and for determination of the longevity. You now listen to me 
carefully. 
7-11. If the 12 Bhavas, including Lagn, are occupied by, or aspected by 
benefic Grahas, they yield auspicious results, according to their 
characteristics, but this happens, where the Grahas concerned are in their 
exaltation Rāśi, own Rāśi, or posited in a benefic Bhava. There will be no 
good effects, if such Grahas are in depression, or posited in an inauspicious Bhava. Similarly the Bhavas, associated with, or aspected by 
malefics in depression, or posited in malefic Bhavas, yield adverse results, 
according to their characteristics. If such Grahas be in their exaltation Rāśi, 
the effects will not be adverse. This is how the general effects have been 
described by the Daivajnas. I have only repeated those effects. The main 
purposes of this Jyotish Shastra are to determine the longevity and joys 
and sorrows of the people, but because the movements of the Grahas are 
so subtle, even sages, like Vashista and Brihaspati, have not been able to 
be quite definite in this respect. Then how can a common man, particularly 
in Kaliyuga, do so. 
12. There are two divisions, or parts of the Jyotish Shastra, namely general 
and particular. I have already dealt with the general part. I now come to the 
other part, which deals with this subject in particular. 
13-15. As the effects of the twelve Bhavas are judged from Lagn and 
Candr, effects of the twelve Bhavas and the various Grahas are judged in 
the same manner. Therefore the inauspicious places from the seven 
Grahas, named, as Karan, beginning from Sūrya and Lagn (total 8), should 
be marked by dots (Bindus) and auspicious places, named, as Sthan, by 
small vertical lines (Rekhas) and on the basis of their assessment should 
the judgment of the horoscope and predictions be made.” 
Notes. The above arrangement is known, as AshtakaVarg. The meaning of 
AshtakaVarg is literally the group of eight things. In other words it is the 
combination of the good and bad positions of a Grah with reference to the 
seven Grahas and Lagn. So it is the combination of the benefic and malefic 
marks (the Rekhas and the Bindus) in a planet‟s chart with reference to the 
position of the eight Grahas (here Lagn is to be treated, as a Grah). 
16. Five Grahas in 1st, 2nd, 8th, 3rd and the 12th Bhavas from Sūrya are 
Karanprad (dot significators). Similarly four Grahas in the 7th and 4th, three 
Grahas in the 6th and 9th, six Grahas in the 5th, 2 Grahas in the 10th and one 
Grah in the 11th are dot significators. 
17-19. Thus Lagn, Candr, Guru, Śukr and Budh in the 1st, 2nd and 8th from 
Sūrya; Sūrya, Mangal, Śani, Candr and Guru in the 12th; Budh, Candr, 
Śukr, Guru in the 4th; Lagn, Candr, Śukr in the 9th; Sūrya, Śani and Mangal 
in the 6th; Lagn, Budh, Guru and Candr in the 7th; Śukr in the 11th; Sūrya, 
Śani, Śukr, Guru and Mangal in the 3rd; Guru and Śukr in the 10th; Sūrya, Śani, Candr, Lagn Mangal and Śukr in the 5th are Karanprad, or dot 
indicators. 
20-22. In Candr‟s AshtakaVarg 6 Grahas in the 9th and the 2nd, 5 Grahas in 
the 4th, 8th and the 1st, one Grah in the 10th and the 3rd, 4 Grahas in the 5th, 
3 Grahas in the 6th and the 7th and 1st, eight in the 12th are Karanprad. Thus 
Lagn, Sūrya, Mangal, Śani and Śukr, these five in the 1st; Lagn, Budh, 
Sūrya, Candr, Śani and Śukr, these 6 in the 2nd; Guru in the 3rd; Sūrya, 
Śani, Candr, Lagn and Mangal, these 5 in the 4th; Śukr, Budh, Guru, these 
3 in the 6th; Mangal, Lagn and Śani, these 3 in the 7th; Mangal, Lagn, Śani, 
Śukr and Candr, these five in the 8th; Lagn, Sūrya, Mangal, Śani, Budh and 
Guru, these 6 in the 9th; Śani only in the 10th; none in the 11th; all the eight 
in the 12th from their own places are Karanprad. These Grahas in the other 
Bhavas are Rekhaprad (line significators). 
23-27. In the AshtakaVarg of Mangal 6 Grahas in the 12th, 4th and 7th, 5 
Grahas in the 5th, 6 Grahas in the 2nd, 7 Grahas in the 9th, 5 Grahas in the 
1st and 8th, 4 Grahas in the 3rd, 3 Grahas in the 10th and 2 Grahas in the 6th 
are Karanprad. In the 11th no Grah is Karanprad. In other words all the 
Grahas in the 11th from their own places are Rekhaprad. Thus Sūrya, 
Candr, Budh, Guru and Śukr, these five in the 1st; Lagn, Sūrya, Candr, 
Budh, Guru and Śani, these 6 in the 2nd; Śukr, Mangal, Guru and Śani, 
these 4 in the 3rd; Sūrya, Candr, Budh, Guru, Śukr and Lagn, these 6 in the 
4th; Candr, Mangal, Guru, Śukr and Lagn, these 5 in the 5th; Mangal and 
Śani, these 2 in the 6th; Budh, Candr, Sūrya, Śukr, Guru and Lagn, these 6

in the 10th, 11th and 6th and all except Guru in the 7th are Karanpradas. 
Thus Lagn, Sūrya and Candr in the 1st; Lagn, Mangal, Candr, Sūrya and

the 11th and Sūrya and Candr in the 12th from their own places are 
Rekhapradas. 
69. In the charts of AshtakaVarg Karan is signified by a Bindu, or dot (0) 
and Sthan by a Rekhapradas, or line (1). Karan is inauspicious, while 
Sthan is auspicious. 70-72. To identify the auspicious and inauspicious Bhavas in the 
AshtakaVarg a chart should be prepared with 14 horizontal lines and ten 
vertical lines. The form of the chart so prepared will consist of 117 
apartments. In this chart in the first line incorporates the names of th e 
seven Grahas and Lagn. In the first column write the numbers of all the 12 
Bhavas. After this mark dots under the Grah and against the Karanprad 
Bhavas. By doing so the Karanprad Bhavas of all the 8 Grahas, including 
Lagn, will become known clearly and whenever the AshtakaVarg Grah will 
pass in transit the dot-marked Bhavas, he will yield unfavourable results. In 
his transit to other Bhavas he would give favourable effects.The following 
table shows the dots in the AshtakaVarg of Sūrya. 
Ch. 67. Trikon Shod hana in the AshtakaVarg 
1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! After preparing the AshtakaVarg of all the 
Grahas, including Lagn, Trikon Shodhana has to be done for each Rāśi. A 
Trikon is made of three Rāśis equidistant from each other. Thus M esh, 
Simh and Dhanu, V rishabh, Kanya and Makar, M ithun, Tul and Kumbh, 
Kark, Vrischik and Meen form the Trikonas of the Rāśis. 
3-5. The Trikon Shodhana (rectification) should be done by writing the 
Rekhas in the AshtakaVargas of Sūrya etc. under the Rāśis Mesh etc. 
Amongst the Trikon Rāśis the Rāśi, which has lesser number of Rekhas, 
should be allotted Rekhas, arrived at by deducting its number of Rekhas 
from the greater number of Rekhas of the three Trikon Rāśis. No Trikon 
Shodhana is necessary, if any of the Trikon Rāśis has no Rekha. 
Shodhana should be done, if all the three of them have equal number of 
Rekhas, that is a zero should be written against all of them. Thereafter 
Ekadhipatya Shodhana should be done in the same manner, described 
later. (For Shodhana of the AshtakaVarg of a Grah the first thing to be done 
is to see, in which Rāśi the Grah is posited. Beginning from that Rāśi, the 
names of the 12 Rāśis should be written and then the names of the 
Grahas, posited in them, should be mentioned against them. Thereafter the 
Rekhas, gained by that Rāśi, should be written below them and the 
number, achieved after Shodhana, below it) 
Ch. 68. Ekadhipatya Shodhana in the AshtakaVarg 
1-5. Ekadhipatya Shodhana is done after writing the numbers for Rāśis, 
arrived at by Trikon Shodhana. Ekadhipatya Shodhana is done, if both the two Rāśis, owned by a Grah, have gained a number after Trikon 
Shodhana. Ekadhipatya Shodhana is not to be done, if one Rāśi has got a 
number and the other is bereft of any number. The following are the rules 
for Ekadhipatya Shodhana. If both the Rāśis are without a Grah and the 
Trikon Shodhana numbers are different, both should be given the smaller 
number. If both the Rāśis are with Grahas, no Shodhana is to be done. If 
amongst the two Rāśis one is with a Grah and a smaller Trikon rectified 
number and the other is without Grah with a bigger number, deduct the 
smaller number from the bigger number and the number of the Rāśi with 
Grah should be kept unchanged. If the Rāśi with the Grah has a bigger 
number than that of the Rāśi without Grah, the Shodhana should be done 
of the number of the Rāśi without Grah and the number of the Rāśi with 
Grah should be kept unchanged. If both the Rāśis are without Grahas and 
possess the same numbers, Shodhana of both the numbers should be 
done and the rectified numbers should be reduced to zero. If one Rāśi is 
with Grah and the other is without any Grah, the number of the latter should 
be reduced to zero. Sūrya and Candr own one Rāśi only, their numbers 
should be kept unchanged. 
6. After doing Ekadhipatya Shodhana, Pinda Sadhana should be taken in 
hand.  
Ch. 69. Pinda Sadhana in the AshtakaVarg 
1-4. The Sage said. O Brahmin! After completing the Trikon and 
Ekadhipatya Shodhana in the AshtakaVargas of all the Grahas, the 
rectified number should be multiplied by the measure of the Rāśi. If there 
be any Grah in any Rāśi, the rectified number should be multiplied by the 
measure of the Grah also. Then, after multiplying the rectified number of 
each Rāśi, the products should be added up. The total so arrived at will be 
Pinda of that Grah. The multiples of Rāśis are 10 for Vrishabh and Simh, 8 
for Mithun and Vrischik, 7 for Mesh and Tul, 6 for Makar and Kanya. The 
multipliers of the remaining Rāśis are the same, as their numbers. 
(Rāśiman Chakr. Mesh 7, Vris 10, Mith 8, Kark 4, Simh 10, Kany 6, Tula 7, 
Vrsk 8, Dhan 9, M aka 5, Kumb 11, Mina 12) The multipliers of Grahas are 
10 for Guru, 3 for Mangal, 7 for Śukr, 6 for Budh, Sūrya, Candr and Śani. 
(Grahman Chakr. Sūrya  5, Candr  5, Mangal  8, Budh  5, Guru 10, Śukr 7, 
Śani 5) 
Ch. 70. Effects of the AshtakaVarg 1-6. The matters to be considered from Sūrya and other Grahas are, as 
follows. Sūrya - the soul (Atma), nature, physical strength, joys and sorrows 
and father. Candr - mind, wisdom, joy and mother. Mangal - co-borns, 
strength, qualities and land. Budh - business dealings, livelihood and 
friends. Guru - nourishment of the body, learning, son (children), wealth 
and property. Śukr - marriage, enjoyments, conveyance, prostitution and 
sexual intercourse with women. Śani - longevity, source of maintenance, 
grief, danger, losses and death. The following procedure should be 
adopted to ascertain the effects of a house. Multiply the number of Rekhas 
with the Yog Pinda (Rāśi Pinda plus Grah Pinda), connected with the 
AshtakaVarg of that Grah and divide the product by 27. The remainder will 
denote the number of the Nakshatr. During the transit of Śani in that 
Nakshatr the Bhava concerned will be harmed. 
7-9. The 9th house from Sūrya at the time of birth deals with father. The 
Rekhas of that Rāśi, as marked in Sūrya‟s AshtakaVarg, should be 
multiplied by the Yog Pinda and the product be divided by 27. The 
remainder will denote the number of Nakshatr. The father will be in 
distress, or he will otherwise suffer, when Śani in transit passes through the 
Nakshatr. Even, when Śani passes in transit the Trikon Nakshatras, father, 
or relatives, like father, may die, or suffer. 
Notes. By dividing the 27 Nakshatras in three equal parts, the 1st, 10th and 
19th fall in Trikon from each other. Sūrya is PitraKarak (significator of 
father). Therefore all about father is ascertained from the Sūrya‟s 
AshtakaVarg. 
10-11. If the AshtakaVarg Rekha number is multiplied by the Yog Pinda 
and the product is divided by 12, the remainder will denote the Rāśi, 
through which, or through the Rāśis in Trikon to it, the transit of Śani will 
cause harm, or unfavourable effects to father. Death of the father may 
occur, if the Dasa prevailing at that time be unfavourable. If the Dasa be 
favourable, father will face only adverse effects. 
(12-15 Arishta to Father) 12-14. The death of the father may be expected, if 
Rahu, Śani, or Mangal are in the 4th from Sūrya at the time of transit of Śani 
through any of the above three Rāśis (Trikon Rāśis). The death of the 
father will come to pass by such transit, if at that time Śani, associated, or 
aspected by a malefic, be in the 9th from Lagn, or Candr and/or the Dasa of 
the Lord of the 4th from Lagn be in operation. The death does not take place, if a favourable Dasa be in force at the time of Śani‟s transit. This 
should be kept in mind by the Jyotishis, while making predictions. 
15. If the Rāśi of Lagn of the native be the 8th Rāśi from Lagn of the father, 
or, if the Lord of the 8th from father‟s Lagn be in Lagn of the native, he takes 
over all the responsibilities of his father after the latter‟s death. 
16-18. The father enjoys happiness in the Dasa of the Lord of the 4th from 
Lagn. The native is obedient to his father, if the Lord of the 4th be in Lagn, 
or the 11th, or in the 11th, or 10th from Candr. If the birth be in the 3rd Rāśi 
from Lagn, or Candr of the father, the native makes proper use of the 
wealth, inherited from his father. If the birth be in the 10th Rāśi from Lagn, 
or Candr of the father, the native will inherit all the good qualities of his 
father. If the Lord of the 10th be in Lagn, the native will be more 
distinguished than his father. 
19-20. No auspicious functions, like marriage etc., should be performed in 
the month of Rāśis (that is, when Sūrya transits that Rāśi), which has more 
number of dots in Sūrya‟s AshtakaVarg. The same applies to the 
Samvatsar of that Rāśi (that is, when the mean Guru transits that Rāśi). 
Auspicious functions should be performed, when Sūrya, or the mean Guru 
transits the Rāśi, which has more Rekhas in Sūrya‟s AshtakaVarg. 
21-23. In the same manner no auspicious functions should be performed 
during the transit of Candr in the Rāśi, which has larger number of dots in 
Candr‟s AshtakaVarg. Consideration, regarding mother, house and village, 
should be done from the 4th Bhava from Candr. Therefore multiply the 
number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg of Candr by the Yog Pinda of that 
AshtakaVarg and divide the product by 27. The death of, or distress to 
mother may be expected, when Śani passes in transit through the 
Nakshatr, denoted by the remainder. Then divide the product by 12. The 
death of the mother may occur, when Śani transits the Rāśi, denoted by the 
remainder. Distress to mother may be predicted, when Śani transits the 
Nakshatras, or Rāśis in Trikon to Nakshatr and Rāśi, indicated above. 
24-27. Consideration of brothers (co-borns), valour and patience is done 
from Mangal‟s AshtakaVarg. If the number of Rekha is larger in any Rāśi 
after Trikon Shodhana, there will be gains of land, happiness from wife and 
great happiness to brother, when Mangal passes through that Rāśi in 
transit. If Mangal be weak, the brothers will be short lived. There will be distress to brothers, when Mangal transits a Rāśi without Rekhas. Here 
also the Yog Pinda of Mangal should be multiplied by the number of 
Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg and the product be divided separately by 27 
and 12. The remainders will denote the Nakshatr and Rāśi. The brother will 
suffer, whenever Śani transits that Nakshatr, or Rāśi (or the Trikon 
Nakshatras, or Rāśis). 
28-29. Consideration in regard to family, maternal uncle and friends should 
be done from the 4th Bhava from Budh. The family etc. will enjoy happiness 
during the transit of Budh‟s AshtakaVarg. After performing Trikon and 
Ekadhipatya Shodhana in Budh‟s AshtakaVarg, the happiness, or distress 
of the family should be predicted from the transit of Śani through the 
resultant Nakshatr and Rāśi (and those in Trikon to them). 
30-33. All about knowledge, religious inclinations of the native and son 
(progeny) is to be ascertained from the 5th Bhava from Guru. If the Rekhas 
in the 5th Bhava from Guru are larger in number in the AshtakaVarg, there 
will be great happiness in respect of progeny. If the dots are larger in 
number, the happiness in respect of progeny will be meagre. The number 
of children are equal to the number of Rekhas in the 5th Bhava (from Guru), 
provided it is not the Rāśi of debilitation of Guru, or his enemy‟s Rāśi. In 
that case the number of children will be very limited. The number of 
children is also equal to the number of Navams, in which the Lord of the 5th 
from Guru is posited. Multiply the Yog Pinda of Guru by the number of 
Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg and divide the product separately by 27 and 
12. The remainders will denote the Nakshatr and Rāśi. Transit of Śani 
through that Nakshatr and its Trikon Nakshatras and of that Rāśi and its 
Trikon Rāśis will be inauspitious. During that period the knowledge, 
learning and religious activities of the native will also be adversely affected.  
34-36. There will be gain of wealth, land and happiness and marriage, 
whenever Śukr passes in transit through the Rāśis, which have larger 
number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg of Śukr. These gains will be from the 
directions of the 7th Rāśi from Śukr and of its Trikon Rāśis. The effects 
should be judged in the manner, already explained earlier, after multiplying 
the Rekhas in the 7th Bhava from Śukr by the Yog Pinda. 
37-40. The 8th Bhava from Śani signifies death, as well as longevity. 
Assessment about longevity should be made from that Bhava through the 
AshtakaVarg. Therefore predict distress to the native in the year, equal to the number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg from Lagn up to Śani. The year, 
equal to the number of Rekhas from Śani up to Lagn, will also be of 
distress. If in the year, equal to the total of the above Rekhas, Arishta Dasa 
be also in operation, there can be possibility of death of the native. 
41-42. Multiply the Yog Pinda by the number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg 
and divide the product by 27. The death of the native will take place, when 
Śani passes in transit through the Nakshatr, denoted by the remainder, or 
its Trikon Nakshatras. Again, divide the product by 12. The native will face 
danger of death, when Śani passes in transit through the Rāśi, denoted by 
the remainder, or through its Trikon Rāśis. 
43-44. The results will be favourable, when Śani passes in transit through 
Rāśis, which have larger number of Rekhas in Śani‟s AshtakaVarg. Śani‟s 
transit through Rāśis, which have larger number of dots, will produce only 
evil effects. 
Ch. 71. Determination of Longevity through the 
AshtakaVarg 
1-4. The sage said. I will now describe the method of determining longevity 
from the AshtakaVarg. For this purpose the AshtakaVargas of Lagn and all 
the Grahas have to be studied. The Rekhas in all the Rāśis have been 
allotted specific spans of life. The Rāśi, which has no Rekhas, has been 
allotted 2 days, that with one Rekha gets l½ days, one day for Rāśi with 2 
Rekhas, half day for Rāśi with 3 Rekhas, 7½ days for Rāśi with 4 Rekhas, 
2 years for Rāśi with 5 Rekhas, 4 years for Rāśi with 6 Rekhas, 6 years for 
Rāśi with 7 Rekhas and 8 years for Rāśi with 8 Rekhas. In this manner the 
spans of life should be worked from Rekhas in all the AshtakaVargas. Half 
of the sum total of all will be the longevity, based on AshtakaVarg. 
Ch. 72. Aggregational AshtakaVargas 
1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! Write down a Rāśi Kundali with 12 Bhavas, 
including Lagn. Then insert the total of the Rekhas in all the AshtakaVargas 
of the Grahas in the Rāśi concerned. The AshtakaVarg with such Rekhas is 
called the Samuday AshtakaVarg, or the aggregational AshtakaVarg. From 
this should be judged good and adverse effects of the Rāśi Kundali. 3-5. In the aggregational AshtakaVarg the Rāśi, which has more than 30 
Rekhas, gives favourable effects, that, having between 25 and 30 Rekhas, 
produces medium effects and that Rāśi, who has less than 25 Rekhas, 
yields adverse effects. Auspicious functions, like marriage etc., should be 
performed, when the Grah, on whose basis the time and date of functions 
are performed, moves into the Rāśi with favourable effects. The Rāśi, 
which is productive of adverse effects should be avoided for these 
purposes. For example, the strength of Candr (CandraBal) is generally 
acceptable for all auspicious functions. Therefore auspicious functions 
should be performed, or started, when Candr is in the Rāśi with maximum 
number of Rekhas. The Grah in the Rāśi with favourable number of Rekhas 
produces auspicious effects and the Grah in the Rāśi with unfavourable 
number of Rekhas yields evil results. 
6-6½. Amongst the 12 Bhavas more than 30 Rekhas advance the effects of 
a Bhava, between 25 and 30 Rekhas produce medium effects and the 
effects of the Bhava, which contains less than 25 Rekhas, get damaged. 
Notes. From the above rules it can be interpreted, that, if there are less 
than 25 Rekhas in 6th, 8th and 12th Bhava, their effects become favourable. 
The effects will become adverse, if these Bhavas contain more than 25 
Rekhas. 
7-8. If in a Rāśi Kundali there are larger number of Rekhas in the 11th than 
those in 10th and there are smaller number of Rekhas in the 12th than those 
in the 11th and Lagn contains largest number of Rekhas, the native will be 
wealthy and will enjoy all kinds of comforts and luxury. 
9-10. Divide the 12 Bhavas in 3 sections. There will be sufferings and 
distress in that part of the life, which is represented by the section of the 
Rāśi Kundali with more malefics. There will be happiness etc., in the part of 
the life, represented by the section of the Rāśi Kundali, containing more 
benefics. There will be mixed results in that area of life, when the relative 
section of the Rāśi Kundali has equal number of benefics and malefics. The 
Bhavas from Lagn up to the 4th signify childhood, those from 5th to 8th youth 
and those from the 9th to 12th represent old age. 
11-28. There will be danger of death in the month of the Rāśi (period of 
Sūrya‟s transit in that Rāśi), which has 7, or less than 7 Rekhas in the 
Samudaya AshtakaVarg. To ward off this evil effect 20 Tolas of gold and 2 heaps of sesame seeds, resembling the shape of a mountain, should be 
given in charity. … possibility of death …, … 8. Tuladan of camphor is 
recommended to obtain relief from this evil effect. … danger of snakes …, 
… 9. A chariot with 7 horses should be given in charity …. … danger from 
weapons …, which contains 10 …. An armour together with Vajra should 
be given in charity to ward off …. … danger of disgrace for no cause …, … 
11. An idol of the moon, made of 10 Tolas of gold, should be given in 
charity …. … danger of death from drowning …, … 12. Land full of crops 
should be given in charity …. … danger of death from wild and violent 
animals …, in which there are 13 …. A Shaligram Shila should be given in 
charity …. … danger of death …, … 14. A Varah Murti, made of gold, 
should be given in charity …. … danger of the wrath of the king …, … 15. 
An elephant should be given in charity …. … danger of Arishta (calamity, 
disaster, or misfortune) …, … 16. A Kalpa Vriksha, made of gold, should be 
given in charity …. … danger from diseases …, that has 17 …. A cow and 
jaggery should be given in charity …. … danger of conflict …, … 18. A cow, 
jewels, land and gold should be given in charity …. … possibility of 
banishment from the homeland …, which has 19 …. Family deity should be 
worshipped …. … loss of intelligence …, … 20. Goddess Saraswati should 
be worshipped …. … distress from diseases …, that has 21 …. A heap of 
grains, shaped, like a mountain, should be given in charity …. … distress to 
kinsmen …, … 22. Gold should be given in charity …. The native will be in 
distress …, … 23. An idol of the sun, made of 7 Tolas of gold, should be 
given in charity …. … death of the kinsmen …, … 24. 10 cows should be 
given in charity …. … loss of wisdom …, … 25. Goddess Saraswati should 
be worshipped …. … loss of wealth …, … 26. Gold should be given in 
charity …. … loss of wealth …, … 27. Sri Sukta Japa should be performed 
…. … losses in several ways …, … 28. Havana of Sūrya should be 
performed …. … anxieties all-round …, … 29. Ghī, clothes and gold should 
be given in charity …. … gains of wealth and grains etc. …, … 30. 
29. There will be all-round increase in wealth, happiness in respect of 
children and enjoyments in the Samvatsar, month and Nakshatr of the 
Rāśi, which has more than 30 Rekhas. … increase in wealth, property, 
children and good reputation, if the Rāśi has more than 40 Rekhas. 
30-31. The Rāśi, which is auspicious in AshtakaVarg Samudaya, is 
considered auspicious for all auspicious functions. Consequently the 
auspiciousness of AshtakaVarg should be got checked before performing 
any function, like marriage etc. If a Rāśi is not auspicious in AshtakaVarg, then its auspiciousness should be checked from transit effects. It is not 
necessary to check transit effects, if a Rāśi is auspicious in AshtakaVarg. 
Thus the auspiciousness of the Rāśi in the AshtakaVarg should be 
considered, as paramount. 
Ch. 73. Effects of the Rays of the Grahas 
1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I am going to tell you about the 
number of rays of the Grahas. When Sūrya etc. are in their deep exaltation 
point, their rays are: Sūrya 10, Candr 9, Mangal 5, Budh 5, Guru 7, Śukr 8 
and Śani 5. The rays are nil, when these Grahas are in deep debilitation, 
the number of rays would be proportionate with the number of Rāśi. The 
following method is to be adopted for ascertaining the proportionate 
number of rays. Deduct the debilitation Rāśi etc. of the Grah, whose rays 
are to be ascertained, from his longitude. If the remainder is less than 6 
Rāśis it should be multiplied by the number of rays of that Grah, mentioned 
above and the product should be divided by 6. The result will denote the 
number of rays of that Grah. In case after deduction the remainder is more 
than 6 Rāśis, then it should be deducted from 12. The other procedure will 
remain the same. 
3-7. The Sage said. O Maitreya! Other Acharyas have recommended 
further correction of the number of rays, worked out in the manner 
described above. The corrections have to be made, as follows. If the Grah 
be in his exaltation Rāśi, the number of rays ascertained should be trebled. 
… Mooltrikon, … doubled. … own Rāśi, … multiplied by 3 and the product 
be divided by 2. … Rāśi of his Adhimitr (great friend), … multiplied by 4 and 
the product be divided by 3. … Bhava of a friend, … multiplied by 6 and the 
product be divided by 5. The number of rays ascertained should be halved, 
if the Grah be in the Bhava of his enemy. If he be in the Bhava of his Adhi-
Shatru (great enemy), the number of rays ascertained should be multiplied 
by 2 and the product be divided by 5. No correction is to be made, if the 
Grah is in the Bhava of a neutral. The effects should be declared after 
computation of the net number of rays of each Grah. 
8-18. The effects, produced by the number of rays of Grahas, are given 
below. Between 1 and 5 poor and unhappy, even if born in an eminent 
family. Between 6 and 10 poor, carrier of loads and without wife and 
children. 11 meagre wealth and few children. 12 meagre wealth, idiot and 
wicked. 13 thief. 14 wealthy, protector and maintainer of several families, learned and observer of the traditions of the family. 15 head of the family, 
achieves proficiency in many kinds of learnings, good qualities. This is what 
Lord Brahma has said. 16 most distinguished in the family. 17 employer of 
many servants. 18 maintainer of large family. 19 possessor of name and 
fame. 20 blessed with a large family and kinsmen. 21 maintainer and 
protector of 50 persons. 22 charitable and kind. 23 well cultured and happy. 
Between 24 and 30 healthy, powerful, favourite of the king, splendourous, 
possessor of a large family. Between 31 and 40 minister and maintainer 
and protector of 100 to 1000 persons. Between 40 and 50 king. 51 and 
above powerful sovereign. 
19. The effects should be predicted, according to the number of rays of the 
Grahas at the time of birth, after taking into account the status of the native. 
20. For example, if the rays are more than 50 in number, one born a 
Kshatriya king‟s family will become a powerful sovereign, one born in a 
Vaishya family will become a king (or high dignitary), one born in Sudra 
family will become wealthy and one born in a Brahmin family will become 
very learned and will observe all religious norms. 
21.The effects of the Grahas, moving from their debilitation to exaltation, 
are full. The effects of the Grahas, moving from their exaltation to 
debilitation, will be lesser than described above. 
22-23. Auspicious and inauspicious effects of all the Grahas are according 
to the number of rays they possess. The prediction will not be correct 
without the knowledge of the effects of the rays. Therefore it is imperative, 
that in the judgment of Rāśi Kundalis and declaring results the effects of 
the number of rays of the Grahas be taken into account. 
Ch. 74. Effects of the Sudarshana Cha kr 
1-3. Maharishi Parasara said to Maitreya. O Brahmin! Now I will impart to 
you the knowledge of a great secrecy and superior importance, which was 
communicated to me by Lord Brahma himself for the benefit of the world. 
This is a Chakr by the name of Sudarshana, through which Devajnas will 
be able to predict the favourable and unfavourable results for every year, 
every month and every day from the time of birth to the time of death of a 
person. Listen to this very intently. 4. O Brahmin! Take a point and from it draw three circles. Within the circles 
draw 12 lines, so as to provide 12 Bhavas within each circle. This is how 
Sudarshana Chakr is drawn. 
5-6. In the first circle (innermost) place the 12 Bhavas from Lagn with 
Grahas, posited there. In the circle next to the innermost circle place the 12 
Bhavas from the Rāśi of Candr with the Grahas in them. In the third circle 
place the 12 Bhavas from the Rāśi of Sūrya with Grahas in them. Thus 
there will be 3 Rāśis in each Bhava of the Chakr. 
7-9. The significant aspect of this Chakr is, that Lagn, Candr and Sūrya 
represent the first Bhava. The 2nd, 3rd etc. up to 12th from Candr and Sūrya 
will deal with the same subject, as they do, when reckoned from Lagn. 
Then the results should be assessed, according to the Grahas in each 
Bhava. In this form of Rāśi Kundali Sūrya is considered auspicious in the 
first Bhava and inauspicious, or malefic in other Bhavas. The malefics do 
not produce evil effects, if they are in their exaltation Rāśi. In this manner 
predictions should be made, after considering the benefic and malefic 
natures of the Grahas, their disposition and aspects from and on them. 
10. A Bhava gets advancement, if it is occupied, or aspected by the Lord, 
or a benefic. The Bhava, which is occupied, or aspected by a malefic, is 
harmed. 
11-13. The effects of a Bhava will be in accordance with the Grah 
occupying it, or in accordance with the Grah aspected, if no Grah is in 
occupation of the Bhava. The effects of a Bhava, occupied by a benefic, 
will be auspicious and the Bhava, occupied by a malefic, will be 
inauspicious. Effects of the aspects will be the same. If a Bhava is 
influenced both by benefics and malefics, the results will depend on the 
majority amongst the benefics and malefics. If the number of benefics i s 
larger than the number of malefics, the results will be auspicious. If reverse 
is the case, inauspicious, or evil effects may be expected. If there are equal 
number of malefics and benefics, those with greater strength will influence 
the results of that Bhava. Mixed results should be declared, if there be no 
difference in the strength of malefics and benefics. The same would apply 
to aspects. 
14. The effects should be declared, according to its Lord, if the Bhava is 
neither occupied, nor aspected by a Gra h. 15-16. A natural benefic loses his benevolence, if he is in more malefic 
Vargas. Similarly a natural malefic loses his malevolence, if he is in more 
benefic Vargas (SaptaVarg). A Grah‟s own Rāśi, his exaltation Rāśi and 
benefic Vargas are considered auspicious. And malefic and the Vargas of 
an enemy and debilitated Rāśi are considered inauspicious. 
17. The sage said, that the results should be declared only after assessing 
the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of all the Bhavas. 
18. Maitreya asked. O Venerable sage! Kindly enlighten me on one point. If 
all the Bhavas are judged in accordance with the Sudarshana Chakr, why 
many learned sages have advocated declaration of effects from the 
Bhavas, reckoned from Lagn in Rāśi Kundali? 
19-20. The sage replied. The results should be declared in accordance with 
the Sudarshana Chakr, only when Sūrya and Candr being in separate 
Rāśis different from the Rāśi of Lagn. If amongst Lagn, Sūrya and Candr, 
all the three, or two of them are in the same Rāśi, the judgment of effects 
should be made from the Rāśi Kundali only. 
(21-23) The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you about the effects, 
produced every year and every month by the twelve Bhavas in their Dasas 
and Antardasas, according to Sudarshana Chakr. Under this system every 
one of the twelve Bhavas, beginning from the 1st, is allotted a Dasa period 
of one year. Thus every year in 12 years a Bhava becomes Lagn of the 
year and the remaining become 2nd, 3rd and so on. Every year every Bhava 
will have Antardasa of one month. By following the method of Lagn of the 
year here also, there will be a Lagn of the month. The first Antardasa will 
be of the first Bhava and then will follow for 12 months the Antardasas of 
the other Bhavas, every Bhava assuming the role of Lagn by turn. Every 
Bhava gets Pratyantar Dasa of 2½ days and Vidasa of 12½ Ghatikas. The 
same method is to be adopted for judging the effects of Bhavas in 
Pratyantar Dasas and Vidasas. 
24-26. At the time of commencement of a Dasa, if there be benefic in the 
1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 5th, 9th and 8th, favourable effects will be experienced in the 
concerned year, month etc. The Bhava, which is occupied by only Rahu, or 
Ketu, becomes harmful. The same will be the fate of the Bhava, which is 
occupied by a larger number of malefics. If there be benefics in Bhavas 
other than the 12th, or 6th, the Bhava concerned will produce favourable effects. In other words, if the benefics be in the 12th, or 6th from the Bhava 
concerned, unfavourable effects will be derived in the related year, month 
etc. If there be malefics in the 3rd, 6th and 11th from the Bhava, assuming 
the role of Lagn, then these three Bhavas will produce auspicious results. 
The effects can be ascertained for every year, month etc. in this manner. 
The total number of years in Vimsottari Dasa are 120 years. After every 12 
years the same method of determining the Dasas, Antardasas etc. has to 
be repeated for Lagn and other Bhavas. 
27-28. After ascertaining the effects of the years, months etc. in 
accordance with the Sudarshana Chakr, assessment of effects for the 
years, months etc. should be made on the basis of AshtakaVarg. The 
benefic, or malefic effects will be full, if the assessment from both produces 
the same results. If they are different, the comparative strength of both 
should be taken into account to declare the final results. 
Ch. 75. Characteristic Features of 
Panchmahapurushas 
1-2. The sage said. O Maitreya! Now I will relate to you the characteristic 
features of Panchmahapurushas. When Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr and 
Śani, being in their own, or exaltation Rāśi, be in Kendra to Lagn, they give 
rise to Ruchaka, Bhadra, Hamsa, Malavya and Sasa Yogas. These Yogas 
are called Panchmahapurusha Yogas and the persons, born in these 
Yogas, are known Panchmahapurushas. 
3-7. The Ruchaka native possesses a long face, he is very enthusiastic, 
has spotless lustre, is powerful, has attractive brows, black hair and is fond 
of all things. He loves to fight wars, is of dark-red complexion, is victorious 
over enemies, is discriminating, is protector of thieves and has cruel 
temperament and slender thighs. He is a devotee of Brahmins, has marks

is 1000 Karshas in weight. He, as ruler of Sahyachala and Vindhya 
Pradesh, dies, after attaining the age of 70, by fire or weapons. 
Notes. The old Rupee had the weight of 1 Karsha. 4 Karshas are equal to 
one Pala and 300 Palas make one Tula, according to Amarkosha. 20 Tulas 
are equal to one Bhara. 8-12. The Bhadra native is splendourous, like a lion, has very developed 
chest (or chest with well developed muscles), has the gait of an elephant, 
has long and thick arms, is learned in all respects. He is well versed in Yog 
performance, is Sattva-Guni and has beautiful feet, moustaches and head. 
He is fond of luxuries and comforts and has marks of Sankha (conch), 
Chakr, Gada, arrow, elephant, Dhwaja (flag) and Hala (plough) in his hands 
and feet. He is well versed in Shastras, has black and curly hair, possesses 
independent nature and is protector of his family. His friends share in the 
enjoyment of his wealth. He is 20 tulas in weight. He lives happily with his 
wife and children and, as ruler of Madhya Desha, lives for one hundred 
years. 
13-16. The Hamsa native has voice, like a Hamsa, has a handsome 
appearance and well developed nose. He is a king with phlegmatic 
temperament, honey-like tawny-coloured eyes, red-coloured nails, sharp 
intelligence, sturdy cheeks, round forehead and beautiful feet. He has 
marks of Matsya (fish), Ankush (the iron hook, with which elephants are 
driven), Dhanus (bow), Sankh, Kamal (lotus) in his hands and feet. He is 
very passionate and his lust remains unfulfilled. He is 96 Anguls in height. 
He is fond of swimming and playing games in watery places. He enjoys life 
fully and, as ruler of a land, situated between the Ganges and Yamuna, 
dies after attaining the age of 100 years. 
17-19. The Malavya native has beautiful lips and a slender waist. He is 
lustrous, like Candr, and has fragrance in his body. He is of ordinary red 
complexion, has a medium stature and clean and beautiful teeth. His voice 
is like that of an elephant and his arms are long enough to reach up to his 
knees. His face is thirteen Anguls in length and ten Anguls in breadth. He 
lives happily for seventy years, as ruler of Sindhu and Malwa, and then 
leaves for his heavenly abode. 
20-22. The Sasa native has small sized teeth and face, but his body is not 
small. He is valorous. He has a slender waist and beautiful thighs. He is 
wise and enjoys wandering in forests and mountains. He is well versed in 
the loopholes of the enemy. He is lively, virile and fond of women. He 
usurps other people‟s wealth. He has marks of Mala (garland), Veena, 
Mridanga (musical instruments) and weapons in his hands and feet. He 
rules happily over several parts of the earth and then leaves for his 
heavenly abode at the age of 70. Ch. 76. Effects of the Elements 
1. The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you about the effects of the five 
elements: space, air, fire, water and earth. 
2. Space, air, fire, water and earth are ruled by Guru, Śani, Mangal, Śukr 
and Budh. The effects are experienced in proportion to the intensity of the 
various elements. 
3-4. The native will have temperament, according to the greater strength of 
the Grah at the time of birth. Guru, Śani, Mangal, Śukr and Budh will, 
respectively, give spacial (etheral), airy (windy), fiery, watery and earthy 
temperament. If all of them, or many of these Grahas have equal strength, 
the temperament will be of a mixed character. 
5. If Sūrya be endowed with strength, the native will have fiery 
temperament. If Candr be strong, the native will have watery temperament. 
All the Grahas in course of their Dasa endow the native with bodily lustre, 
relating to their elements. 
6. The characteristic features of the person with fiery temperament are: 
distressed with hunger, restless, lean and thin body, learned, consumes a 
large quantity of food, sharp, fair-complexioned and proud. 
7. … earthy: emits fragrance of camphor and lotus, is fond of luxuries, 
comforts and enjoyments and is permanently happy, forgiving and has a 
deep voice, like a lion. 
8. … etheral: acquainted with semasiology, expert in diplomacy, brilliant, 
learned, unmasked face and long stature.  
9. … watery: is lustrous, can sustain burdens, is soft-spoken, king, has 
many friends and is learned. 
10. … airy: charitable, full of anger, fair complexion, fond of wandering, 
victorious over enemies, king and has lean physique. 
11. When the fire element is predominant in a person, his face and body 
exhibit lustre, like gold and he has happy-looking eyes. He achieve s 
success in all his ventures, is victorious over his enemies and gets gains of 
wealth. 12. … earth, the body of the person emits various kinds of fragrances. His 
nails, hair and teeth are are clean. He gets gains of happiness and wealth 
and is religious-minded. 
13. … ether, the person is a clever conversationalist and becomes happy 
by learning to songs etc. 
14. … water, the person‟s body is slender, he enjoys good health and tasty 
food and is happy on that account. 
15. … air, the body is filthy. The person becomes an idiot and suffers from 
rheumatism, sorrows and agonies. 
16. The sage said. O Brahmin! The effects of the elements, which I have 
described above, will be realized in full, if the Grahas concerned are 
endowed with adequate strength. If they are weak, the effects will be 
reduced in proportion to their weakness. 
17. If the Grah concerned is in his debilitation Rāśi, or be placed in an 
inauspicious Bhava, the elemental effects will be adverse, that is, opposite 
to the effects, described above. If a Grah is without strength, his elemental 
effects will be experienced only in imagination. 
18. If a person‟s time, date and place of birth is not known, he should 
determine the Dasa of a Grah from the effects, mentioned above and, if he 
is facing evil effects, he should take appropriate remedial measures to 
appease the Grah concerned. 
Ch. 77. Effects of the Gunas 
1-4. The Great Sage Parasara said. O Brahmin! When the Sattva-Guni 
Grahas are predominant, the person born is Sattva-Guni and of good 
character. When Rajo-Guna (passion of love and pleasure) is predominant, 
the person born is Rajo-Guna and intelligent. When the Tamo-Guna 
(attribute of darkness) is predominant, the person born is stupid. When at 
the time of birth all the Grahas are of equal dominance, the person has a 
mixture of all the attributes. The persons (creatures) so born  are classified, 
as Uttama (most excellent), Madhyama (of intermediate type), Adhama 
(despisable) and Udaseena (indifferent, or neutral) in that order. Thus there 
are four kinds of animate beings (Prani). I will relate their attributes, which 
have been described by Narada and other sages. 5. The natural attributes of persons, belonging to Uttam class, are 
possession of control over organs of perception and mind, simplicity, 
truthfulness, patience and satisfaction. 
6. Valour, splendour, patience, cleverness, not retreating in war and 
protecting the holy men are the natural attributes of persons, belonging to 
Rajo-Guna.  
7. Greed, falsehood, idiocy, laziness and doing service of others are the 
inborn attributes of persons, who belong to Adham class. 
8. Engagement in agriculture and business, protection of cattle and 
speaking both truth and lies are inborn attributes of persons, belonging to 
Udaseena class. 
9. O Maitreya! Classify the people, as Uttama, Madhyama, Adhama and 
Udaseena after observation of the attributes, described above. A person 
should be considered appropriate for a job, according to his attributes. 
10. If amongst Sattva, Rajas and Tamas any attribute is the most dominant, 
it is considered the most predominant of all. Otherwise all have equal 
effects. 
11. The affectionate relationship between an employer and employee and 
man and women will be invariable and stable, if they possess the same 
attributes. 
12. O Maitreya! Amongst the above four classes of persons, if there is any 
kind of relationship of even Adhama with Udaseena, of Udaseena with 
Madhyama and of Madhyama with Uttama, there will be mutual affection 
and happiness. 
13. If the bridegroom has better attributes than the bride and the master 
has better attributes than the servant, there will be mutual affection (regard 
for each other) and happiness. If the bride, or the servant possesses better 
attributes, the relationships will be full of bitterness. 
14. The attributes of the native are dependent on his father and mother, his 
time of birth and the persons, he gets associated with. These are the root 
causes of Uttama etc. qualities, possessed by him. The attributes, endowed by the time of the birth and associations, are stronger than those, 
received from the parents. 
15. Consequently the person is embellished with the attribute Sattva, 
Rajas, or Tamas, whichever is predominant at the time of birth. The 
predictions should therefore be made after taking into account the time of 
birth. 
16. The Supreme Lord of the Universe, who is indestructible and omnicient, 
is the Kal. He is the Creator, Protector and Destroyer of all movable and 
immovable. 
17. These three faculties of Lord Kal are called nature. Divided by these 
faculties, the imperceptible Lord Kal is also perceptible. 
18. In accordance with the self-created qualities by the Perceptible form of 
Lord Kal, there are four kinds of limbs, namely Uttama, Madhyama, 
Udaseena and Adhama. 
19. From the Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena and Adhama parts are 
created Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena and Adhama types of creatures. 
20. The Uttama part of Lord Kal is the head, Madhyama part both arms and 
chest, thighs form the Udaseena part and the feet fall in the Adhama part. 
21. This is how a differentiation is made between classes of movables and 
immovables, according to attributes and the parts, from which the creations 
are made. 
22. The Chaturvidha (four sided) Lord Kal has thus created this 
Chaturvidha universe in consonance with his own attributes. 
Ch. 78. Lost Horoscopy 
1-2. Maitreya said. O Sage! You have so far described the auspicious and 
inauspicious effects to be enjoyed, or suffered by a person on the basis of 
the time of birth, but can the auspicious and inauspicious be ascertained, 
when the time of birth is not known? Kindly tell me, if there is any way to 
solve this problem. 3-4. The Sage said. Your question is a good one and is for the benefit of 
the world at large. Considering your attachment, I will tell you about this 
problem also. If any, or all amongst the Samvatsar, Ayana, Ritu, month, 
Paksha, Tithi, Nakshatr, Lagn, Rāśi, or Amsas etc. of the birth are not 
known, these can be ascertained from Prasna Lagn (Query chart). 
5-6. The Samvatsar of the birth of the querist will be the same, as that of 
the Rāśi in the Dwadasams, in which the Prasna Lagn falls (Guru will be in 
that Rāśi at birth). Saumyayan (Uttarayan - the northern course of Sūrya) 
will be in the first Hora of Lagn and Yamyayan (Dakshinayan - the southern 
course of Sūrya) will be in its second Hora. The Ritu (season) may be 
determined with reference to the Lord of the Drekkan, in which Lagn falls. 
Shishir will be indicated by the Drekkan of Śani, Grishma by that of Sūrya 
and Mangal, Vasanta by that of Śukr, Varsha by that of Candr, Sharad by 
that of Budh and Hemanta by that of Guru. 
7. If there be any contradiction in the Ayana and Ritu, the Ritu may be 
determined from Budh in place of Mangal, from Śukr in place of Candr and 
from Śani in place of Guru. 
8-9. After the Ritu becomes known take the first part of the Drekkan, as its 
first month and latter part, as the next month of the Ritu. Then from the 
expired Amsas of the Drekkan determine proportionately the Tithi, or the 
Amsas of Sūrya. The Istakal, indicated by the Amsas (degrees) of Sūrya, 
will be the time of the birth of the querist. From the Istakal so calculated 
have to be worked out the longitudes of the Grahas and Bhavas (Grah 
Spast and Bhava Spast). Predictions should then be made in accordance 
with the dispositions of the Bhavas and Grahas. 
10. Maitreya asked. O Sage! Guru returns to the same Rāśi after every 12 
years. Then from which circle of Guru should Samvatsar be determined. 
11-12. The Sage said in reply. O Maitreya! When there is any doubt about 
the Samvatsar, take the approximate age of the querist and add multiples 
of 12 to the difference between the Rāśi of the Guru at the time of query 
and his Rāśi at the time of birth. The figure so arrived at should be taken, 
as the possible number of years and the Samvatsar should be determined 
accordingly. If by adding 12 there may appear to be difference in age, the 
position of Guru should be fixed, according to guessed approximate age, in 
the Trikon Rāśi, 5th, or 9th of the Prasna Lagn, as may be found feasible. Then, taking that, as the Samvatsar, the Ayana, Ritu etc. should be worked 
out accordingly in the manner already explained. 
13. Maitreya asked again. O Sage! How will the time of birth be known after 
ascertaining the month and the Amsas etc. of Sūrya. Please explain this for 
the benefit of the people. 
14-16.The Sage said. After ascertaining the Rāśi, Amsas etc. of Sūrya at 
the time of birth, the longitude of Sūrya (Sūrya Spast) should be worked out 
for the next day after the number of days, taken by Sūrya after entering into 
the Rāśi, which will be equal to the expired Amsas of Sūrya. Then the 
difference between the longitudes of this rising Sūrya and Sūrya at the time 
of birth should be converted into Kalas and multiplied by 60. The product 
should be divided by Sūrya Spast, converted into Kalas. The Ghatikas etc. 
so becoming available will represent the Istakal of the birth before and after 
sunrise. If the longitude of the Ista Sūrya be more than that of the rising 
Sūrya, the Istakal of the birth will be so much after the sunrise. If the 
longitude of the Ista Sūrya be less than that of the rising Sūrya, the Istakal 
of the birth will be so much before the sunrise. 
Ch. 79. Ascetism Yogas 
1. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will describe to you the Yogas, leading 
to ascetism, under the influence of which the persons give up their homes 
and become initiated in some holy order. 
2-3. The Yog for ascetism is formed, when four, or more Grahas, 
possessed of strength, occupy a single Bhava. The person born will 
become a Tapasvi, a Kapali, he will be wearing a red robe, be one, who 
keeps a Danda (staff), Yati, he will be keeper of a Chakr, or he will be a 
naked Sanyasin, according to the Grah, which is the strongest of the group: 
Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr, or Śani. If a number of Grahas 
are endowed with strength, the holy order of the one, strongest amongst 
them, is accepted. 
Notes. There is a similar verse in Varahamihir‟s Brihat Jatak, which, 
translated into English reads, as under. “If at birth, four, or more Grahas, 
possessed of strength, occupy a single Bhava, the person born will become 
a Sakya, Jeevika, Bhikshu, a Vriddha, or Guru, a Charak, a Nirgrantha, or 
Visava, a Vanyasana, or Vanaprastha, according to which of the Grahas is the strongest Grah of the group: Mangal, Budh, Guru, Candr, Śukr, Śani, or 
Sūrya. If the strongest Grah be conquered in planetary war by another 
Grah, or Grahas at the time of birth, the person will relinquish that stage of 
ascetic life and review to his previous condition of life.” A Vanaprastha is a 
religious man, engaged in the practice of rigorous and devout penance (i.e. 
he will be a Tapasvi); a Vivas is a naked ascetic (that is dwelling in hills and 
forests). A Bhikshu is an illustrious ascetic with a single staff for his symbol, 
engaged ever and anon in the contemplation of truths of the sacred 
scriptures. A Charak is a religious mendicant, wandering over many 
countries. A Shakya is an ascetic of the Buddhist clan. A Guru is a 
celebrated teacher, endowed with royal splendour. A Jeevika is a garrulous 
and gluttonous mendicant. 
4. If strong Grahas, capable of leading to ascetism, be obscure by Sūrya‟s 
rays (that is they be combust), the person born, in spite of having 
reverence for the holy order, will not become initiated in that holy order. 
Notes. Brihat Jatak adds in this connection, that, if the Grahas referred to 
above be overcome in planetary war and be aspected by other Grahas, the 
person concerned will seek admission into the holy order without success. 
5. If the other Grahas lose their strength (in spite of being in their exaltation 
Rāśis etc.), as a result of combustion with Sūrya, the native will enter the 
holy order, as signified by Sūrya, that is, he will become a Tapasvi. 
6. If the Lord of the Rāśi, occupied by Candr (Janm Rāśi), having no aspect 
of other Grahas on himself, aspects Śani, the native gets initiated into the 
holy order of the Grah, who is stronger amongst the two. 
7. If the Lord of the Rāśi, occupied by Candr, be devoid of strength and is 
aspected only by Śani, the native becomes initiated into the holy order, 
signified by Śani (Nirgranthas, naked ascetics). 
8. If Candr be in the decanate of Śani, or in the Navams of Śani, or Mangal 
and be aspected by Śani, the native becomes an ascetic and enters the 
holy order, signified by Śani. 
9. There is planetary war, if Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr and Śani are 
together (within one degree of each other), Śukr is the conquerer, whether 
he is in North, or South, but amongst the other four only one, who is in the North, is the conquerer and that in the South is considered defeated in the 
planetary war. 
10. If the Grah, who leads the native to ascetism, is conquered in planetary 
war by another Grah, or Grahas at the time of birth, the person will 
relinquish the holy order, in which he becomes initiated. 
11. Maitreya asked. O Venerable Sage! If there be many Grahas, who are 
significators for ascetism, then, which holy order the native will get initiated 
into? 
12. Maharishi Parasara replied. O Brahmin! If all the Grahas be possessed 
of strength, the native enters into the holy orders of all the Grahas. 
13. The native gets initiated into the holy order of the Grah, whose Dasa 
gets into operation at first. Then he relinquishes this holy order of this Grah 
at the commencement of the Dasa of the next Grah and accepts the holy 
order, signified by him. 
14. When Guru, Candr and Lagn are aspected by Śani and Guru occupies 
the 9th, the person, born in the Rajayog, will become a holy illustrious 
founder of a system of philosophy (holy order). 
15. When Śani occupies the 9th from Lagn and is not aspected by any 
Grah, the person, possessed of Rajayog, will take himself to the holy order, 
before becoming a Lord of men. If there be no Rajayog the native becomes 
an ascetic (religious wanderer). 
Ch. 80. Female Horoscopy 
1. Maitreya asked. O Sage! You have described the effects of many kinds. 
Now be kind enough to throw light on Strī Jatak (female horoscopy). 
2. Maharishi Parasara replied. What a good question! Listen to what I am 
going to tell you about the Rāśi Kundalis of females. All the effects, that 
have been described till now in the case of male horoscopies, will apply to 
females also. Matters, relating to her physical appearance, should be 
determined from Lagn, those, relating to children, from the 5th Bhava, 
fortune for the husband from the 7th and death of the husband (widowhood) 
should be deduced from the 8th. Those effects, which are impossible to 
ascribe to the female, should be declared to be applicable to her husband. Brihat Jatak. “Of the effects, that have been described till now in the case 
of male horoscopes and those, that may be found in female horoscopes, 
suitable to females, should be declared, as applicable to them alone. The 
rest should be ascribed to their husbands. The death of the husband is to 
be deduced through the 8th place (from Lagn, or Candr, whichever is 
stronger). Matters, relating to her appearance, beauty etc., should be 
determined from Lagn and the Rāśi, occupied by Candr. It is from the 7th 
place (from Lagn, or Candr), that her welfare (happiness) and the nature of 
the husband should be ascertained.” 
Mantreswara‟s Phaldeepika. “Whatever effects are declared for men, they 
are entirely applicable to women too. The woman‟s prosperity and 
happiness have to be deduced from the 8th place (from Lagn, or Candr, 
whichever is stronger). Children should be declared from the 9th Bhava and 
matters, relating to her appearance, beauty etc., should be determined 
from Lagn. It is from the 7th place, that her welfare (power of influencing her 
husband) and the nature of the husband should be ascertained, while her 
association and chastity should be predicted from an examination of the 4th 
Bhava. Benefics in those Bhavas produce good results, while malefics in 
the above Bhavas are productive of evil, unless they happen to own the 
Bhavas, in which case the effects will be good.” 
Jatak Parijata. Whatever effects may accrue from the horoscopes of 
females, applicable only to men, should be ascribed to the husband. The 
good and evil, affecting their person, should be calculated from Candr and 
Lagn, whichever of them is stronger. It is from the 7th Bhava from Lagn, or 
Candr, that all, that is worthy, or unworthy in the husband should be 
ascertained and the death of the husband is foretold through the 8th. All this 
should be well weighed by the strength, or weakness of the Grahas, 
benefic and malefic. Before an announcement is made, of Lagn and Candr 
find, which is stronger. It is with reference to this, that the luck, beauty and 
strength of the women should be announced. Children and wealth in 
abundance should be declared through the 9th Bhava therefrom. Wedded 
happiness, or otherwise should be gathered from the 8th and husband‟s 
fortune from the 7th. Some Jyotishis opine, that the well-being, or the 
reverses of the husband can be determined from the 9th. 
5. If at the time of birth of a woman Lagn and Candr are in even Rāśis, the 
woman will be truly feminine in character. She will possess excellent 
qualities, be of steadfast character, beautiful and physically fit. 6. If Lagn and Candr are in odd Rāśis, she will be masculine in form and 
masculine in bearing and, if they be associated with, or aspected by 
malefics, she will be devoid of good qualities and be sinful. 
7. If amongst Lagn and Candr one be in an even Rāśi and the other be in 
an odd one, the woman concerned should be declared to partake the 
characteristics of both male and female. The qualities of Lagn, or Candr will 
be more predominant, according to their strength. 
8. O Brahmin! The effects in respect of women would particularly depend 
on the Rāśi and Trimsams of Lagn, or Candr, whichever is stronger. 
9-16. When Lagn, or Candr is in a Rāśi, belonging to Mangal, the woman, 
born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will have illicit relations with a man before 
marriage. If she be born in Trimsams of Śukr, she will become unchaste 
after marriage; if of Budh, she will be full of guile and adept in conjuration; if 
the Trimsams be of Guru, she will be worthy and virtuous; she will be 
menial, or slave, if birth be in a Trimsams of Śani. … in a Rāśi, owned by 
Budh, the female, born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will be full of guile, will be 
a hard-worker; if the Trimsams be of Śukr, will be possessed of good 
qualities; if of Budh, will be of the nature of hermaphrodite; if of Guru, will 
be chaste. In a Rāśi, owned by Śukr, a female, born in a Trimsams of 
Mangal, will be deprived; if the Trimsams be of Śukr, will be well known and 
possessed of excellent qualities; if of Budh, will be skilled in all arts; she will 
be endowed with all good qualities, if born in a Trimsams of Guru; she will 
remarry, if born in a Trimsams of Śani. When Lagn, or Candr happens to 
be in a Rāśi, owned by Candr and the Trimsams of birth is owned by 
Mangal, the female born will be self-willed and uncontrolled; she will be 
unchaste and of loose character, if born in a Trimsams of Śukr; will be 
skilled in arts and handiwork, if of Budh; will be gifted with all excellent 
qualities, if of Guru; will become a widow, if of Śani. …, owned by Sūrya 
and the Trimsams of birth be owned by Mangal, the female born will be 
very talkative; she will be virtuous, if born in a Trimsams of Śukr; will bear 
masculine features, if of Budh; will be chaste and virtuous, if of Guru; will 
be unchaste, if of Śani. When the rising Rāśi, or the Rāśi, occupied by 
Candr, is owned by Guru, the female, born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will be 
endowed with many good qualities; she will be Punschali, if born in a 
Trimsams of Śukr; will be well versed in many sciences, if of Budh; will be 
endowed with all good qualities, if of Guru; will not indulge much in sexual 
intercourse, if of Śani. When Lagn, or the Rāśi, occupied by Candr, belongs to Śani, the female, born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will be a maid-servant; 
she will be learned (barren, according to Brihat Jatak), if born in a 
Trimsams of Śukr; will be cruel and immoral, if of Budh; will be devoted to 
her husband, if of Guru; will be unchaste (addicted to men of low caste, 
according to Brihat Jatak), if of Śani. 
17-21. If the 7th Bhava be without a Grah (without strength) and without 
benefic aspect, the female born will have a coward and contemptible 
wretch for her husband. When the 7th Bhava is a moveable Rāśi, the 
husband will always be away from home. If Budh and Śani be in the 7th 
Bhava, the husband of the woman concerned will be impotent. If Sūrya 
occupies the 7th Bhava, the woman concerned is abandoned by her 
husband. If Mangal be in the 7th, the female concerned becomes a widow 
in her childhood. If Śani be in the 7th, she lives to an old age, remaining 
unmarried. If there be a malefic, she becomes a widow, while young. If 
there be a benefic in the 7th, the female born will enjoy marital happiness 
and will be chaste. If there be both benefics and malefics in the 7th, both 
benefic and evil effects will be experienced. If Mangal be in the Navams of 
Śukr and Śukr be in the Navams of Mangal, the female concerned will have 
illicit relations with other men. If in this Yog Candr be in the 7th, the female 
concerned enters into illicit connections at the instance of her husband. 
22-25. If at woman‟s birth the 7th Bhava, or the setting Navams be that of 
Mangal, the husband will be fond of other women and will be of an irascible 
temper. If it be a Rāśi, or Navams of Budh, her husband will be very 
learned and clever. If it be a Rāśi, or Navams of Guru, the husband of the 
woman concerned will be of great merit and will have passions under his 
control. If it be a Rāśi, or Navams of Śukr, her husband will be fortunate, 
very good-looking and liked by women. If the Rāśi, or Navams belongs to 
Śani, her husband will be an old man and a fool. If the Rāśi, or Navams be 
Simh, her husband will be exceedingly soft in his disposition and will be 
very hard-working. If the 7th Bhava, or the setting Navams be a Rāśi, 
owned by Candr, the husband of the woman will be love-sick and gentle. If 
there be different Rāśis and Navamsas in the 7th, the effects will be of a 
mixed nature. The effects of the Rāśis and Navamsas will depend on their 
strength. 
26-29. If in a female‟s horoscope Sūrya be in the 8th, the native will be 
unhappy, poverty-stricken, of deformed limbs and without faith in religion. If 
Candr be in the 8th, the woman concerned will be of a defective vagina, will have ugly breasts, with sinister eyes, without robes, or ornaments, sickly 
and will be defamed in the society. If Mangal, the native will be of weak 
constitution, sickly, widow, ugly-looking and full of sorrows and agonies. If 
Budh, she will be without faith in religion, timid, devoid of wealth, self-
respect and good qualities and she will be quarrelsome. 
30-33. If in a female‟s horoscope Guru be in the 8th, the woman concerned 
will be shameless and without virtue, will have few children, fatty hands and 
feet, will be abandoned by her husband and be gluttonous. If Śukr be in the 
8th, she will be fond of pleasures, devoid of sympathy, religion, wealth, will 
be dirty and deceptive. If Śani, the woman concerned will be of wicked 
disposition, dirty, deceptive and devoid of conjugal harmony. If Rahu, she 
will be ugly, without marital happiness, cruel-hearted, sickly and unchaste. 
34. The woman will be barren, if in her Rāśi Kundali Candr and Śukr be 
associated with Śani, or Mangal and the 5th Bhava be occupied, or 
aspected by a malefic. 
35. If the 7th be in the Navams of Mangal, the vagina will be diseased. If the 
7th be the Navams of a benefic, she will have a well formed female organ 
and will be beloved by her husband. 
36. If Mithun, or Kanya Lagn in a female‟s horoscope is occupied by Śukr 
and Candr, the woman concerned lives happily and is equipped with all 
kinds of comforts in her father‟s house. 
37. If Candr, Budh and Śukr be in Lagn, the woman concerned is endowed 
with many good qualities and happiness. If Guru be in Lagn, she is happy, 
wealthy and has children. 
38. If the 8th Bhava be Simh, or Kark and Sūrya and Candr be both placed 
there, the woman concerned will be barren. If the 8th be Mithun, Kanya, or 
Kark and Budh and Candr be posited there, the female native will have only 
one child. 
39. The woman concerned will be definitely barren, if Lagn be Mesh, 
Vrischik, Makar, or Kumbh and Candr and Śukr be posited there, aspected 
by malefics. 40. The woman concerned will give birth to an already dead child, if the 7th 
be occupied by Rahu and Sūrya, or Guru and Rahu be in the 8th and the 5th 
be occupied by malefics. 
41. The woman concerned will not be able to conceive, if Guru and Śukr be 
associated with Mangal in the 8th, or Mangal be with Śani in the 8th. 
42. The woman concerned becomes a destructor of her husband‟s family 
and her father‟s family, if at her birth Candr and Lagn be subjected to Papa 
Kartari Yog (direct malefics in 12th and retrograde malefics in 2nd). 
43. The woman, whose birth takes place under the following conditions, is 
named, as Visha Kanya. Day of birth Sunday, Nakshatr Aslesha, 2nd Tithi; 
Saturday, Krittika, 7th Tithi; Tuesday, Satabhisha, 12th Tithi. 
44. The woman will be Visha Kanya, if at birth Lagn be occupied by a 
malefic and a benefic and two Grahas be in inimical Rāśis. 
45. Visha Kanya gives birth to a child already dead. She has a defective 
generative organ and is bereft of robes, ornaments etc. 
46. The evil effects of Visha Kanya are destroyed, if the Lord of the 7th is a 
benefic, or a benefic Grah be in the 7th from Lagn, or Candr. 
47. The woman born becomes a widow, if Mangal be in the 12th, 4th, 7th, or 
8th from Lagn, without aspect by, or association with any benefic. 
48-49. The Yog, which causes the woman to become widow also causes a 
male native to become a widower. If the man and woman, possessing this 
Yog, join in wedlock, the Yog ceases to have any effect. 
50-51. If at a woman‟s birth the rising Rāśi be that of Śukr and the rising 
Navams be of Śani (Kumbh, according to Brihat Jatak) and, if Śukr and 
Śani aspect each other, or are occupying each other‟s Navams, she will be 
afflicted with too much lust and will allay her fire of passion with the help of 
other females, acting the part of a male. 
52. When Guru, Mangal, Budh and Śukr are strong and, when the rising 
Rāśi is an even one, the woman born will be learned in Shastras and an 
expounder of the Vedanta Philosophy. 53. When a malefic Grah is in the 7th and some Grah in the 8th, the woman 
concerned will become an ascetic. 
54. The woman dies before her husband, when in her nativity there is a 
benefic in the 8th, without aspect by, or association with a malefic. 
55. If at the birth of a woman there are equal number of benefics and 
malefics and they possess the same strength, she without doubt will leave 
for her heavenly abode along with her husband. 
Ch. 81. Effects of Characteristic Features of Parts of 
Woman’s body. 
1-2. Maitreya said. O Venerable Sage! I have been fully enlightened by the 
auspicious and inauspicious effects, described by you with reference to the 
Janm Lagn in a female‟s horoscope. Now I request you to favour me with 
knowledge of auspicious and inauspicious effects with reference to the 
characteristic features of the various parts of a woman‟s body. Maharishi 
Parasara replied. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you what Lord Shiva narrated 
to Goddess Parvati in this regard. 
3-4. A woman, whose soles are even, smooth, soft, well developed, warm 
and shining in pink colour, without much perspiration, will be enjoying full 
happiness, befitting her sex. The one, whose soles are without pink colour, 
hard, dry, coarse, uneven, shaped, like a winnowing basket and bereft of 
flesh, will suffer misery. 
5-6. The woman, who has marks of conch, Swastika, Chakr, lotus, flag, 
fish, umbrella and a long line, rising upwards in her soles, becomes a 
queen and enjoys great happiness and comforts. The one, who possesses 
marks, like those of snake, rat and crow, is bereft of wealth and suffers 
misery. 
7. The girl, whose nails of toes are shining in pink colour, smooth, raised 
and round, enjoys great happiness and comforts. Blackish and torn nails 
denotes misery. 
8. Raised, full, well developed, smooth and round great toe indicates 
happiness. The one, which is small, irregular in shape and flat, denotes 
misery. 9. The woman‟s toes, which are soft, thick, round and well developed are 
considered auspicious. If the toes are long, she will be of loose morals. 
Thin toes indicate poverty. 
10-16. Other effects about the toes are, as under. Short - short life. Short 
and long and irregular in shape - procurer and guileful. Flat - maid-servant. 
Spaced more than average - bereft of wealth. Toes, overlapping one over 
the other - widow and dependent on others. If dust is thrown up, when she 
walks - unchaste and brings defame to all the three families (her father‟s, 
mother‟s and husband‟s). If the smallest toe does not touch the ground - 
she will destroy her husband and marry another; If the middle toe and the 
one next to it does not touch the ground - widow. First toe (next to great 
toe) longer than the great toe - she will develop illicit connection with a man 
before marriage and will be of loose morals. 
17. If the back of the feet of a woman is raised, without perspiration, soft 
and smooth, she will become a queen. If the indications are contrary, she 
will be poverty-stricken. She will be fond of travelling, if the back part of the 
feet be veined. Hair on that portion of feet denote, that she will be a maid 
servant. If the feet be bony, or without flesh, she will have a defective 
sexual organ. 
18. If the heels are even, the woman concerned will have a well formed and 
desirable sexual organ. If the heels be stout, she will have a defective 
sexual organ. If the heels be high, she will be unchaste. Long heels 
indicate misery. 
19. Legs (portion below knees). Even, smooth, evenly shaped, round, 
without hair, good looking and without veins showing up are Rāśis, that the 
woman will be a queen. 
20. Round, smooth, firm knees are auspicious indications. If the knees be 
bony, the woman concerned will be of loose moral character. If the knees 
be loose, she will be poverty-stricken. 
21. If the thighs are round, like the trunk of an elephant, close to each 
other, soft and without hair, the woman concerned will be a queen. If the 
thighs are flat and hairy, she will be poverty-stricken and a widow. 
22-23. Waist. Circumference equal to the width of 24 fingers with well 
developed hips indicate, that the woman will be fortunate. A waist, which is flat, long, without flesh, caved in, or hairy, forebodes widowhood and 
misery. 
24. Raised, fleshy and widespread hips in a woman are auspicious in 
effects. If they are contrary, they indicate inauspiciousness. 
25-27. Sexual organ. Hidden clitoris, pink-coloured, curved, like the back of 
a tortoise, soft, hairy, shaped, like the leaf of a Pipal tree and smooth is 
highly auspicious. If shaped, like the feet of a deer, or opening of an oven 
with hard hair and with raised clitoris, it indicates evil. If the left side of the 
sexual organ of a woman is raised, she will beget more female children 
and, if the right side is raised, more boys. If the organ is shaped, like a 
conch, she will be barren. 
28. Portion below the navel. A soft, spread out and slightly raised Vasti is 
auspicious. Hairy, veins, showing up and full of lines (folds, or wrinkles) 
indicates inauspiciousness. 
29. A navel deep with right turns is productive of good effects. The navel 
raised, with left turns and with knots is inauspicious. 
30-31. A stomach well spread indicates a well formed sexual organ and 
many sons. If the stomach of a woman resembles that of a frog, her son 
will become a king. If a woman has a raised stomach she will be childless. 
If the stomach is wrinkled, she will become an ascetic. If it has circular 
folds, she will become a maid-servant. 
32. If the portion, covering the ribs, is even, well developed and soft, 
auspicious effects may be expected. It will be inauspicious, if it is raised, 
hairy and full of veins. 
33. The chest of a woman, which is even and hairless is auspicious. Wide 
spread and hairy chest is inauspicious. 
34-36. The breasts of a woman signify good luck, if they are of equal size, 
fleshy, round and firm, but close together. They are unlucky, if they are 
thick in front, are not close together and without flesh. Raised right breast 
indicates, that she will have sons. Raised left breast indicates, that she will 
have daughters. If the portion, surrounding the nipples, is round, good-
looking and blackish, she will enjoy good luck. Pressed in and unusually 
small breasts indicate bad luck. 37. Shoulders. Even, well built up and without joints showing up are Rāśis 
of good luck. Raised, hairy and without flesh are unlucky. 
38. The armpits, if soft, with thin hair, well developed and smooth are 
auspicious. Those, which are deep, without flesh, perspiring and with veins, 
showing up are inauspicious. 
39-40. Arms, in which the bones do not show up and which are soft jointed, 
hairless without obvious veins, straight and round are auspicious. Those 
without flesh, hairy, small, with obvious veins and irregular in shape are 
inauspicious. 
41. If the thumbs of the woman are shaped, like a lotus bud, they are 
auspicious. If they are without flesh and irregular in shape, they are 
inauspicious. 
42-43. If the palms of the woman are pink-coloured, raised in the middle, 
with fingers close together (with no holes between them), soft and have 
very few lines, she enjoys happiness and all comforts. If the palms are full 
of lines, she will become a widow. If there are no lines, she will be poverty-
stricken. If the veins show up in the palms, she will live on alms. 
44. If the backs of the hands of a woman are well built, soft and hairless, 
she will enjoy auspicious effects. It will be otherwise, if the backs of the 
hands are with veins, showing up, deep and hairy. 
45-47. Lines on the palm. A woman enjoys happiness and all comforts, if 
there is a clearly marked, pink-co loured, circular, smooth, full and deep line 
(perhaps line of life is meant). If there is mark of a fish, she will be very 
lucky. She will be wealthy with mark of Swastika. She will be a queen with 
mark of a lotus. She will be the mother of a king, if she has marks of conch, 
umbrella and tortoise. 
48-50. The woman, who has lines, forming the shapes of a balance, 
elephant, bull, or horse, becomes the wife of a businessman. The woman, 
who has lines, forming the shape of a house, or Vajra is lucky and gives 
birth to a son, who becomes learned in Shastras. The woman, who has 
lines, forming the shapes of a chariot, a plough, or a yoke, becomes the 
wife of a farmer. She will become a queen, if she has lines, forming the 
shape of Chamar, Ankush, trident, sword, mace, Shakti, or trumpet. 51-52. If in the palm of a woman there is a line, which, starting from the root 
of the thumb goes up to the root of the little finger, she becomes a widow. If 
there are lines, forming the shape of a crow, a frog, a jackal, a wolf, a 
scorpion, a snake, a donkey, a camel and a cat, the woman concerned 
suffers misery. 
53-54. If the fingers of a woman are tender with good-looking phalanges, 
tapering at the end and without hair, they are considered auspicious. If they 
are very small, without flesh, irregular, widely spaced, with hair and with 
more than usual phalanges, or without phalanges, they indicate misery. 
55. If the nails of the fingers are pink-coloured, raised and shaped well at 
the top, they are auspicious. Depressed, dirty-looking, or yellow, or white-
coloured nails, or nails with spots are inauspicious. 
56. If the back of the woman is fleshy and well developed with flesh, it is 
auspicious. The back with hair, irregular in built and with veins showing up 
is inauspicious. 
57-58. The neck of a woman with three lines (folds), with bones not 
obvious, round, well developed and tender is auspicious. A thick necked 
woman becomes a widow. An irregularly built neck indicates, that the 
woman concerned will become a maid-servant. Flat necked woman will be 
barren. A woman with a small neck is childless.

hard-skinned, depressed and without flesh are indicative of misfortune. 
62. If the mouth of a woman is of normal size, firm, round, emitting 
fragrance, smooth and good-looking, it is indicative of good luck. If 
otherwise, it will be inauspicious. 
63-65. If the lower lip of a woman is red, like a lotus, smooth, divided in the 
middle and good looking, she becomes a queen. If it be without flesh, coarse, long, dry and blackish, it is indicative of misery and widowhood. If 
the upper lip of a woman is pink-coloured, smooth and slightly raised in the 
middle, it is indicative of happiness and good fortune. If otherwise, it will be 
inauspicious. 
66-67. A woman, whose teeth are smooth, milk white, 32 in number and 
whose upper and lower teeth, though equal in size, are slightly raised, will 
be lucky. If lower teeth are more in number, are yellow, or black-coloured, 
fierce looking, widely spaced and double, they are indicative of misfortune. 
68-69. If the tongue of a woman is red and soft, she enjoys great happiness 
and comforts. Caved in the middle and spread out in front indicates misery. 
White tongue indicates death in water. Dark tongue indicates quarrelsome 
nature. Thick tongue denotes poverty. Long tongue denotes one, who is 
omnivorous. Long and broad tongue denotes lunacy. 
70-71. Palate red, like lotus, soft and smooth - good luck, white - 
widowhood, yellow - ascetism, black - barrenness, dry - large family. 
72. When a woman laughs, if her cheeks are raised and teeth are not 
visible, she will be lucky. If it is otherwise, she will not be lucky. 
73-74. If the nose of a woman is evenly round and has small nostrils, it is 
auspicious. If the nose is thick in its front part and flat in the middle, it is 
inauspicious. If the tip of the nose is red, or shrunken, widowhood is 
indicated. Flat nose indicates engagement in a menial job. Too small, or 
too large nose denotes quarrelsome nature. 
75-77. Black pupils with cow‟s milk like white portion of the eye, large and 
broad, smooth, with black eyelashes are lucky Rāśis. Raised eyes show 
short life. Round eyes denote loose moral character. Honey-coloured eyes 
indicate good fortune and happiness. The eyes, like those of a pigeon, 
indicate wickedness. Eyes, like those of an elephant, indicate misery. If the 
left eye is blind, adulterous tendency will manifest. Blindness of the right 
eye indicates barrenness. 
78. A woman with soft, black, compact eyelashes with thin hair is fortunate. 
Eyelashes thick, scattered and with tawny-coloured hair indicate misery. 79. If the eyebrows of a woman are round, shaped, like a bow, smooth, 
black, not joined and with soft hair, she is blessed with happiness and 
fame. 
80. Ears of a woman long with a round turn indicate children and 
happiness. Small, unevenly shaped, very thin, with veins, showing up, 
cause her misery. 
81-82. The forehead of a woman without veins, showing through, without 
hair, shaped, like a half-moon, even, with equal to three fingers are Rāśis 
of a fortunate woman, blessed with husband and children. Rāśi of Swastika 
on the forehead denotes a queen. Very long, highly raised and hairy 
forehead causes misery. 
83. Head of a woman high and round, like that of an elephant, is indicative 
of happiness. A head, which is spread out, flat, big and uneven, indicates 
misery. 
84-85. The hair of a woman are indicative of good fortune. If they are soft, 
black, long, thin and yellow, they indicate misfortune. But honey-coloured 
hair of a fair complexioned woman and black hair of a dark complexioned 
woman are also considered auspicious. Most of the characteristic features, 
described in this chapter, apply to men also. 
Ch. 82. Effects of Moles, Marks, Signs etc. for Men and 
Women 
1. Maharishi Parasara said. O Maitreya! Now I will describe to you the 
effects of moles, marks, spots and signs, found on the body of women and 
men. 
2-3. A mole, spot, or figure, formed by hair on the left side of a woman and 
right side of a man is auspicious. If there is mole on the chest of a woman, 
she will be fortunate. A woman, who has a red mark, like a mole etc., on 
her right breast, begets many children and she is blessed with all kinds of 
enjoyments and comforts. 
4. The woman, who has a red mark (mole) on her left breast, begets only 
one son. 5. The woman, who has a mole on her right breast, begets many daughters 
and sons. 
6. There will be gain, or acquisition of a kingdom, if there, as is a red mole 
etc. on the forehead, or in the middle of (between) the eyebrows. The 
person will enjoy sweetish preparations, if there is such a mark on the 
cheeks. 
7-10. The woman, who has a red mark (mole etc.) on her nose, becomes 
consort of a king. If the mark be blackish, the woman concerned becomes 
an adulteress, or widow. All the marks below the navel are auspicious for 
both men and women. If there be moles etc. on the ears, cheeks, or neck 
of a man, his first issue will be male and he will enjoy good fortune and 
happiness. The m an, who has moles etc. in the thighs, suffers misery. 
11. The woman, who has the sign of trident on her forehead, becomes a 
queen. Such a mark on the forehead of a man makes him a king. 
12. A right-turned circular hair formation on heart, navel, hands, right part of 
the back and in the portion between sex organ and navel is auspicious. 
Left-turned formation is inauspicious. 
13-14. Such a hair formation on the waist and private parts proves 
inauspicious. If such a formation be on the stomach, the woman concerned 
will become a widow. If it be in the center of the back she will become an 
adulteress. It will be inauspicious, if it be on the neck, forehead, or center of 
the head. 
15. A man with indications of short life will get his longevity prolonged by 
marrying a woman with auspicious, or lucky marks/symbols. 
Ch. 83. Effects of Curses in the Previous Birth 
1-3. Maitreya said. O Venerable Sage! You have acquainted me with 
effects, experienced by men and women in a number of ways. According to 
Shastras, the soul of a person does not rest in peace after his death, if he 
is not blessed with a son. What sin does a person commit to remain without 
a son? And what are the remedial measures to be adopted by him to get a 
son? Kindly enlighten me about this. 4. Maharishi Parasara replied. I will now tell you, whatever Lord Shiva told 
Goddess Parvati in this respect. 
5. Goddess Parvati said to Lord Shiva. O my Lord! What is the sin, which 
causes destruction of children amongst men. Please tell me, what are the 
Yogas for such an effect and what are the remedial measures to protect the 
children? 
6. Lord Shiva replied: O Devi! You have asked a very relevant question. 
Now I will tell you the Yogas for loss of children and the requisite remedial 
measures. 
7. A person will be without a son, if Guru, the Lord of Lagn and the Lord of 
the 5th are all devoid of strength. 
8. The same will happen, if Sūrya, Mangal, Rahu and Śani, endowed with 
strength, be in the 5th and the significator for children, namely Guru and 
Lord of the 5th etc. be bereft of strength.

Rahu is in the 5th, aspected by Mangal; the Lord of 5th is associated with

Mangal, is associated with Mangal and Lagn is occupied by Rahu and 
Gulika; the 5th is Mesh, or Vrischik and the Lord of the 5th is associated with 
Rahu, or Budh; the 5th is occupied by Sūrya, Śani, Mangal, Rahu, Budh 
and Guru and the Lords of the 5th and Lagn are devoid of strength; the Lord 
of Lagn, or Guru is associated with Rahu and the Lord of the 5th is in 
conjunction with Mangal. 
17-19. Remedial measures should be adopted to obtain protection from the 
evil effects of the above Yogas. These are getting an idol of Naga (serpent) 
Raja, made in gold and, after worshipping it in accordance with prescribed 
procedure, giving in charity a cow, some land, sesame seeds and gold etc. 
By adopting these measures the Lord of Serpents will be gratified and by 
his beneficence the person concerned will be blessed with a son and the 
lineage of his family will be prolonged.  20-30. There will be no male issue, as a result of the curse of the father in 
the previous birth, if at birth of the native Sūrya in his debilitation Rāśi and 
in the Navams of Śani is hemmed in between malefics in the 5th Bhava; 
Sūrya, as Lord of the 5th, posited in a Trikon with a malefic, is hemmed in

Rāśi of Sūrya, the Lord of the 5th is with Sūrya and Lagn and the 5th are 
occupied by malefics; Lord of Lagn, devoid of strength, is in the 5th and the

measures are performance of Shraddha at Gaya; to feed ten thousand, one 
thousand, or 100 Brahmins, as one can afford; Kanyadana (to perform the 
marriage of a girl); giving a cow in charity. By observing these remedial 
measures, the person concerned becomes free from the curse and the 
family lineage is prolonged by the birth of sons, grandsons etc. 
Note. In this chapter, where the words „childlessness‟ and „issue-lessness‟ 
are used, they should be interpreted to mean want of male issue, because 
it is the male issue, who by performing the last rites of his father and 
mother ensures eternal peace to their souls. 
34-50. A person will be without a male issue, as a result of curse of the 
mother, if at birth Candr, as Lord of the 5th is in her debilitation Rāśi, or is

of rocks between India and Sri Lanka, recite one Lakh Gayatri Mantras, 
give in charity things, connected with evil Grahas, feed Brahmins and go 
round a Pipal tree 1008 times. By performing these remedial measures, he 
will not only beget a son, the lineage of family will also be prolonged.

measures are to observe Candrayana fast and to do penance three times 
and to give in charity a cow and five gems with gold, after feeding 
Brahmins, according to one‟s means and giving them presents in cash. 
Then the person will be released from the curse and will be endowed with 
happiness.  
82-92. A person does not beget a male issue, as a result of the curse of the 
wife, if at birth Lord of Lagn is in 5th, Śani in the Navams of Lord of 7th and

with a son, if he performs the marriage of an unmarried girl, or, if such a girl 
is not available, a gold idol of the Lakshminarayana, fertile cow, a bed, 
ornaments and garments to a Brahmin couple. 
Notes. According to our view, „Kanyadana‟ does not mean giving a girl in 
charity, but helping in the performance of the marriage of an unmarried girl, 
not his own daughter. 
95-105. If the person, whose duty is to do so, does not perform Shraddha 
of his father, or mother in his previous birth, the departed soul is formed 
into an evil spirit and he is deprived of a male issue in the next birth. This is 
revealed by the following Yogas at birth. Śani and Sūrya in 5th, waning 
Candr in 7th and Rahu and Guru in 12th; Śani, as Lord of 5th in 8th, Mangal 
in Lagn and Guru in 8th; Malefics are in Lagn, Sūrya in 12th, Mangal, Śani

106-108. The person concerned gets release from the curse and is blessed 
with a son, if he undertakes the following remedial measures. Performance 
of a Pinda Dana, Rudra Abhisheka, giving in charity a gold idol of Brahma, 
a cow, a vessel, made of silver and a Neelamani, feeding Brahmins and 
giving them presents in cash. 
109-111. If a person is deprived of a male issue, as a result of malevolence 
of Grahas at birth, he will be blessed with a son, if he undertakes the 
following remedial measures. Worshipping Lord Shiva, if the harm is, as a 
result of the malevolence of Budh and Śukr; reciting of Santan Gopa l Mantra, wearing and worshipping appropriate Yantra and taking suitable 
medicines, if the childlessness is a result of the malevolence of Guru and 
Candr; Kanya Dana, if the childlessness is due to malevolence of Rahu; 
worshipping of Lord Vishnu, if it is due to malevolence of Sūrya; Rudriya

devotion to Haribansh Puran removes all kinds of blemishes and blesses 
the person concerned with a son. 
Ch. 84. Remedial Measures from the Malevolence of 
Grahas 
1. Maitreya said. O Venerable Sage! Please describe for the good of 
mankind the remedial measures for appeasement of the malevolent 
Grahas. 
2. The Sage replied. I have already described the names and characteristic 
features and qualities of the Grahas. Joys and sorrows of all the creatures 
in the world are dependent on these Grahas. Therefore persons desirous of 
peace, wealth and prosperity, rainfall, good health and longevity should 
worship the Grahas (by prayers, recitation of Mantras, charity etc.). 
3-5. For the purpose of worshipping them the idols of Sūrya, Candr, 
Mangal, Budh, Guru, Śukr, Śani, Rahu and Ketu should be made of 
copper, Sphatika (rock crystal), red sandal wood, gold (both Budh and 
Guru), silver, iron, glass and bell metal, respectively. Alternatively the 
sketches of all the above Grahas should be drawn in the colours, belonging 
to them, on a piece of cloth by sandal etc. and they should be placed in 
their own directions. 
6. Contemplate of Sūrya well adorned with two arms, seated on a lotus, 
with a lotus flower in one hand, red-coloured, like lotus and aboard a 
chariot of seven horses. 
7. Contemplate of Candr white-coloured, dressed in white robes, with two 
arms, carrying a mace in one hand and a Vara in the other, adorned wit h 
white-coloured ornaments and aboard a chariot of ten horses. 
8. Contemplate of Mangal with a red necklace, dressed in red-coloured 
robes, with four arms, carrying Shakti, Shoola, Gada (mace) and Vara and 
mounted on a lamb. 9. Contemplate of Budh with a y ellow -coloured garland, dressed in yellow 
robes, with four arms, carrying a sword, a shield, a mace and Vara, 
mounted on a lion. 
10. Contemplate of Guru, as yellow complexion and Śukr of fair 
complexion, both with four arms, carrying a Danda, Akshasutra, Kamandal 
and Vara. 
11. O Maitreya! Contemplate of Śani with the lustre, like that of Indraneela, 
with four arms, carrying Shoola, bow, arrow and Vara, mounted on a 
donkey. 
12. Contemplate of Rahu with a hideous face, with four arms, carrying a 
sword, a shield, a Shoola and a Vara, blue-coloured and mounted on a lion. 
13. There are many Ketus. All of them are of smoky colour, with two arms, 
carrying a mace and a Vara, with a hideous face and mounted on a 
donkey. 
14. All the idols should be so made, that they are 108 fingers tall by one‟s 
own fingers. 
Notes. Such a measurement is taken from the middle finger. 
15-16. Dedicate with devotion to the Grah concerned the flowers and 
garments of the colour, belonging to him, sandal, Deep, Guggul etc., his 
metal and the grains, dear to him and distribute all these things to 
Brahmins to appease the Grah. 
17-20. The Mantras of all the Grahas and the prescribed number of their 
recitation are given below. The recitation of Mantras should be done after 
worshipping the Grahas, as indicated in verses 15-16. Grah Mantra 
prescribed number: Sūrya 7000, Candr 11000, Mangal 11000, Budh 9000, 
Guru 19000, Śukr 16000, Śani 23000, Rahu 18000, Ketu 17000. 
21-22. Havan should be performed with Aak, Palash, Khair, Chirchiri, Pipal, 
Goolar, Shami wood pieces, Doob and Kush, for Sūrya, Candr, Mangal, 
Budh, Guru, Śukr, Śani, Rahu and Ketu, respectively, mixed with honey, 
Ghī, curd, or milk. The number of offerings to the sacred fire is 108, or 28. 23-24. To appease Sūrya and the other eight Grahas Brahmins should be 
fed with (cream) of rice cooked with jaggery, rice cooked in milk, Havishya, 
paddy cooked in milk, curd and rice, rice with Ghī, rice cooked with powder 
of sesame seeds, rice cooked with meat, rice cooked with cereals, 
respectively. 
25. To appease Sūrya and other Grahas the things to be given in charity 
are cow with calf, conch, bullock, gold, robes, horse, black cow, weapons 
made of iron and goat, respectively. 
26-27. The Grah, who is the cause of adverse effects to a person at any 
time, should be handled by worship and appeasing (of the benevolent 
ones), because Brahma has blessed the Grahas with the boon “Do to the 
persons, who worship you”. And the development and progress and 
downfall of the people and the creation and destruction of the universe are 
all under the administration and authority of the Grahas. Therefore they are 
most venerable. 
Ch. 85. Inauspicious Births 
1-4. The Venerable Sage said. O Maitreya! Now I will describe to you the 
circumstances, in which the births are inauspicious in spite of Lagn and the 
Grahas being well disposed. Although Lagn may be well disposed, births 
will be inauspicious, if they take place on Amavasya (last day of the 
Krishna Paksha), on Chaturdasi (14th Tithi), in Krishna Paksha (dark half of 
the month), in Bhadra Karan, in the Nakshatr of the brother, in the 
Nakshatras of father and mother, at the time of entry of Sūrya in a Rāśi, the 
time of Pata, at the time of solar and lunar eclipses, at the time of Vyati 
Pata, in Gandantas of all the three kinds, in Yamaghant, Tithikshaya, in 
Dagdha Yog etc. The birth of a son after three daughters and birth of a 
daughter after three sons and the birth of a freak are inauspicious. But 
there are remedial measures for obtaining relief from the evil effects of 
such births, which are being described in the following chapters. 
Ch. 86. Remedies for Amavasya Birth 
1-9. The Sage Parasara said. O Maitreya! The person, born on Amavasya, 
is always poverty stricken. It is therefore essential to adopt remedial 
measures to obtain relief from the evil effects of such births, which are, as 
follows. Take a Kalash (water vessel) and then put in it fresh leaves of Goolar (wild fig), Vata (banyan), Pipal, mango and Neema (mango) trees 
and cover it with two pieces of cloth. Then install the Kalash in the South-
West direction after reciting … etc. and … etc. Mantras. Then worship the 
idols of Sūrya and Candr, ruling deities of Amavasya, made of gold and 
silver, mixed with copper, respectively, by recitation of … etc. Mantras for 
Sūrya and … etc. Mantras for Candr 16, or 5 times. Thereafter perform 
Havan with 108, or 28 oblations of the mixture of prescribed fuels (…) and 
cooked food (Charu) with recitation of Mantras of Sūrya and Candr. Later 
sprinkle the water on the child, that is born and his parents and offer in 
charity gold, silver and a black cow together with feeding the Brahmins, 
according to one‟s means. By performing these remedial rites the child 
born gains freedom and protection from the evil effects of the birth on 
Amavasya. 
Ch. 87. Remedies from Birth on Krishna Chaturdashi 
1-3. The Sage said. Divide the span of Chaturdashi in 6 parts. The birth in 
the first part is auspicious. Second part causes destruction, or death of 
father. Third part causes death of the mother. Fourth part takes away the 
maternal uncle. Fifth part destroys the entire family (Khula - generation). 
Sixth part causes loss of wealth, or destruction (death) of the native. 
Therefore it is essential to take immediate remedial measures to escape 
these evil effects. 
4-5. Have an idol of Lord Shiva, made of one Karsha (equal in weight to the 
former silver Rupee) of gold, or of weight one can afford. The idol should 
have a New Moon on the forehead, have a white garland round the neck, 
have three eyes (one being on the forehead), be dressed in white robes, be 
seated on a bull, be two-armed and carry Vara and Abhaya. 
6-13. Then after invocation with Varun Mantra worship should be 
performed by chanting … etc. Mantras. Thereafter a Kalash should be 
placed in the North-East direction with chanting of „Imah Mai Varun‟, „Tan 
Tva Yami‟, „Tvan Nai Agni‟ Mantras, followed by Japa of … etc. and 
„Bhadra Agni …‟ Suktas and the chanting of … Mantra. Then, after 
sprinkling water over the idol of Lord Shiva (Abhisheka), the nine Grahas 
should be worshipped. This should be followed by Havan, by using Ghī, 
powder of sesame seeds, Urda, Sarson and wood pieces of Pipal, Pakar, 
Palas and Khadir trees. 108, or 28 oblations should be made separately for 
the nine Grahas. Thereafter, along with chanting of … etc. Mantras, Havan should be performed with sesame seeds for the nine Grahas. Lastly the 
water of the Kalash should be sprinkled on the native and his parents and 
the Brahmins should be fed, according to means. 
Ch. 88. Remedies from Birth in Bhadra and 
Inauspicious Yogas 
1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Now I am going to describe the remedial 
measures for relief from the evil effects of birth in Bhadra, Tithi Kshaya, 
Vyatipata, Paridha, Vajra etc. inauspicious Yogas and Yamaghants etc. 
The remedial rites should be performed on the day, when the same 
inauspicious Yog operates again. 
3-5. The remedial rites are to be performed in the following order by the 
parents of the child in the above inauspicious Yogas. Puja of Lord Vishnu 
and other deities on an auspicious day and auspicious Lagn on the advice 
of a proficient Jyotishi, burning of Deep with Ghī in a Shiva temple, 
Abhisheka of Lord Shiva, going round a Pipal tree 108 times prolongs 
longevity and perform Havan with 108 oblations along with the recital of 
„Vaisneh Raratmachityadhi‟ Mantra of Lord Vishnu and feeding Brahmins to 
the best of one‟s means. The observance of these remedial measures will 
give deliverance to the native from all the evil effects of his inauspicious 
birth and he will enjoy happiness. 
Ch. 89. Remedies from Nakshatr Birth 
1-7. The Sage Parasara said. O Maitreya! If the birth takes place in the 
Nakshatras of the brother and the parents, death takes place, without 
doubt, of the brother and the father, or mother, or they have to undergo 
death-like suffering. Therefore I am going to describe the remedial 
measures to be adopted to escape from these evil effects. The remedial 
rites should be performed in a Muhurta, when Candr and stars are 
favourable on a day, on which there is no Rikta-Bhadra Dosha. The 
remedial rites should be performed in the following order. Instal an idol of 
the Janm Nakshatr on a Kalash in the North-East direction from the fire. 
Cover it with a red piece of cloth and then warp two pieces of cloth round it. 
Worship the idol by chanting the Mantras of the Janm Nakshatr. According 
to one‟s Gotra, perform Havan 108 times with the recitation of the same 
Mantra, facing the fire, with Ghī and other Havan material. Then the priest, 
performing the Puja, should sprinkle water on the parents and brother (whoever is concerned). Give presents in cash (Dakshena) to the priest 
and his colleagues, associated with the ceremony, to the best of one‟s 
means and then feed the Brahmins to the best of one‟s means. 
Ch. 90. Remedies from Sankranti Birth 
1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! The names of the Sankranti on the seven 
days of the week, beginning from Sunday, are Ghora, Dhavankshi, 
Mahodari, Manda, Mandakini, Mishra and Rakshasi. The person, born at 
the Sankranti (entry of Sūrya in a new Rāśi), is poor and unhappy, but he 
becomes well-to -do and happy, if remedial measures are undertaken. I am 
now going to describe the remedial measures to nullify these evil effects. 
3-6. The Yagya of the nine Grahas should be performed to obtain relief 
from the evil effects of the birth at Sankranti. A clean spot in the eastern 
part of the house should be purified by besmearing with cow dung. Then 
prepare three separate heaps of the following: 5 Dronas (80 Seers) of 
paddy (Sadhi), 2½ Dronas (40 Seers) of rice, 1¼ Dronas (20 Seers) of 
sesame seeds (Til). On these heaps of grains make a figure of lotus with 
eight leaves (Ashtamdhal) and then decorate them with flowers. After doin g 
this, select and invite a priest, who is well versed in the performance of 
religious rites and recitation of Mantras. 
7-18. The religious rites are then to be performed in the following order. 
Install Kalashas without any holes on all the three heaps and put in each of 
them water from holy places, Saptamrattika, Shataushadhi, Panchapallava 
and Panchagavya. Then wrap the Kalashas with pieces of cloth. Place 
small earthen pots, wrapped with thin cloth, on the Kalashas. Then install 
the idol of Sankranti along with the idol of Adhideva and Pratyadhideva. 
(Here Sūrya is Adhideva and Candr Pratyadhideva). Their idols should be 
placed on either side of the main idols of Sankranti. Two robes may be 
given, as offering to each of the idols. Perform worship of all the three idols, 
according to the prescribed procedure. The main idol should be worshipped 
with the chanting of „Trayambakam‟, „Yajam Hai‟ etc., the idol of Sūrya with 
Mantra „Ut Sūrya‟ and the idol of Candr with Mantra „Apayayashava‟ etc. 
The worship should be performed with Shodshopchar, or Panchopchar, as 
may be possible. After touching the main idol, Mrityunjaya Japa should be 
recited 1008, 108, or 28 times, as may be possible. Make a small platform 
in the West of the installed Kalashas, kindle fire on it and perform the 
prescribed rites. Then perform Havan 1008, 108, or 28 times with Samidha, Ghrit (Ghī) and Charu (powder of Til) within one‟s means along with 
chanting of „Trayambakam‟ etc. Mantra. 8) Again perform Havan, first with 
the fuel of sesame seeds along with recitation of Mrityunjaya Mantra. After 
performing another Svistkrita Havan, sprinkle the holy water on the child 
born and his parents. Lastly feed as many Brahmins, as one can afford. By 
performing the remedial rites, described above, the evil effects are nullified 
and the native and his parents enjoy happiness. 
Ch. 91. Remedies for Birth in Eclipses 
1-14. The Sage said. O Brahmin! A person, whose birth takes place at the 
time of solar, or lunar eclipse, suffers from ailments, distress and poverty 
and faces danger of death. Therefore I am going to describe for the benefit 
of the mankind the remedial measures, required to be undertaken to nullify 
the above evil effects. The remedial rites are to be performed in the 
following order. The following idols should be got prepared, according to 
one‟s means: in gold an idol of the deity of the Nakshatr, in which the 
eclipse takes place (regarding deities of Nakshatras, see „notes‟ of verse 
18, Ch. 3, Vol. I); in gold an idol of Sūrya, if the birth takes place during 
solar eclipse; in silver an idol of Candr, if the birth takes place during lunar 
eclipse; in lead an idol of Rahu. Besmear a clean spot on the ground (in the 
house) with cow dung, cover it with a new (unused) beautiful piece of cloth 
and install the three idols on it. Make offerings of the following to the idols: 
in case of birth during solar eclipse all things dear to Sūrya and red-
coloured Akshat (Akshata - rice), red sandal, a garland of red-coloured 
flowers, red clothes etc.; in case of birth during a lunar eclipse all things 
dear to Candr and white sandal, white flowers, white clothes etc.; for Rahu 
blackish clothes, blackish flowers etc.; white flowers for the deity of the 
Nakshatr, in which the eclipse takes place. The worship should be 
performed, as follows: of Sūrya with the chanting of „Akrishnim‟ etc. Mantra; 
of Candr with the chanting of „Imadeva‟ etc. Mantra; of Rahu with Durva (a 
kind of grass) and with the chanting of „Kayanshicatra‟ etc. Mantra. 
Thereafter Havan should be performed, as follows: with the fuel of Aak 
wood pieces for Sūrya; with the fuel of Palas tree wood pieces for Candr; 
with Durva for Rahu; with Pipal tree wood pieces for the deity of the 
Nakshatr. Sprinkle the holy water of the Kalash on the child born (and his 
parents). Offer worshipful regards to the priest, performing the remedial 
rites and lastly feed as many Brahmins, as possible within one‟s means. By 
performance of the remedial rites in the manner described above, evil effects of the inauspicious birth are wiped and the native enjoys happiness 
and is blessed with good fortune. 
Ch. 92. Remedies from Gandanta Birth 
1. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Gandanta is of three kinds, namely of Tithi, 
Nakshatr and Lagn. Birth, travelling and performance of auspicious 
functions, like marriage etc., during Gandanta are likely to cause death of 
the person concerned. 
2. O Maitreya! The last 2 Ghatikas of Purna Tithi (5th, 10th, 15th) and the first 
2 Ghatikas of Nanda Tithi (1st, 6th, 11th) are known, as Tithi Gandanta. 
3. Similarly the last two Ghatikas of Revati and first two Ghatikas of 
Ashvini, the last two Ghatikas of Aslesha and first two Ghatikas of Magha 
and the last two Ghatikas of Jyeshtha and first two Ghatikas of Mula are 
known, as Nakshatr Gandanta. 
4. The last half Ghatika of Meen and first half Ghatika of Mesh, the last half 
Ghatika of Kark and first half Ghatika of Simh, the last half Ghatika of 
Vrischik and first half Ghatika of Dhanu are known, as Lagn Gandanta. 
5. Amongst these Gandantas the last 6 Ghatikas of Jyeshtha and first 8 
Ghatikas of Mula are known, as Abhukta Mula. 
6-8. Now I will tell you the remedial measures to be adopted to release the 
child, born during Gandanta, from its evil effects. The father should see the 
child born only on the morning next to the end of the days of Sutaka, or on 
any auspicious day after the performance of the remedial measures. The 
remedial measures are giving a bullock in charity in the case of Tithi 
Gandanta, giving a cow with calf in charity in the case of Nakshatr 
Gandant a, giving gold in charity in the case of Lagn Gandanta, performing 
Abhisheka of the child along with father, if the birth is in the first part of 
Gandanta and along with mother, if the birth is in the second part of 
Gandanta. 
9-11. Performance of Puja on the holy Kalash of the idol of the deities of 
Tithi (in case of Tithi Gandanta), Nakshatr (in case of Nakshatr Gandanta) 
and Lagn (in case of Lagn Gandanta), made of 16 Masas, 8 Masas, or 4 
Masas of gold, as may be possible, followed by Havan and Abhisheka, 
according to procedure already described earlier. At the end as many Brahmins, as may be possible within one‟s means, should be fed. These 
remedial measures will ensure long life, good health and prosperity for the 
child. 
Notes. Unless one is himself fully conversant with the performance of 
religious rites, the remedies, recommended in this chapter, earlier and later 
chapters, should be got performed by and under the directions of a learned 
priest, because the full effects will be derived, if the rites are performed 
correctly and according to the procedure, prescribed in the religious 
scriptures on this subject. 
Ch. 93. Remedies for Abhukta Mula Birth 
1-2. The Sage Parasara said. The ruling deity of Jyeshtha is Indra and the 
ruling deity of Mula is Rakshasa. As both the deities are inimical to each 
other, this Gandanta is considered, as the most evil. A boy, or girl, born 
during the period of Abhukta Mula, should either be abandoned, or the 
father should not see the face of the child for 8 years. Now I shall describe 
the remedial measures to obtain deliverence from the evil effects of birth 
during this extremely inauspicious period. 
3-4. In view of the extremely inauspicious effects of birth during Abhukta I 
shall first describe the remedial measures to obtain relief from Mula. The 
religious remedial rites should be performed after the 12th day after the 
birth, the next Janm Nakshatr day, or on an auspicious day, when Candr 
and the stars are favourable. 
5-8. Erect a canopy (Mandap) with four arched gateways, embellished with 
festoons, on a sacred spot, besmeared with cow dung paste, to the East, or 
North of the house. Prepare there a pit (Kund), or place there a square 
vessel of clay, or metal for performing Havan. Then, according to one‟s 
means, prepare, or get prepared an idol of Rakshasa of 16, 8, or 4 Masas 
of gold, as may be possible within one‟s means. The idol should be with a 
horrible-looking face, black in colour, with two heads, two arms, carrying a 
sword and a shield and seated on a dead body. 
9. In the absence of an idol a piece of gold of the weight, mentioned above, 
should be used for worship, as gold is dear to all the deities. 10-20. Thereafter the remedial rites should be performed in the following 
order. Select a learned priest to perform the religious rites, according to the 
prescribed procedure. Install a Kalash and put in it Panchagavya (five 
articles, yielded by a cow, namely milk, curd, Ghī, dung and urine), 
Shataushadhi and water of the holy river (Ganga etc.). Then install the idol 
of the Rakshasa of Mula, facing West, on an earthen pot (Dhata) with one 
hundred tiny holes. After placing bamboo leaves on it, perform the worship 
of the idol by offering it white flowers, sandal and clothes etc. Also perform 
worship of its Adhideva Indra and Pratyadhideva Jal. Then perform Havan 
to appease the deities. According to one‟s means, 1008, or 108 oblations 
should be offered in the Havan. After this to obtain deliverence from death 
Mrityunjaya Mantra etc. should be recited and prayers offered to all the 
deities for the purpose of Abhisheka. The father, mother and the child 
should thereafter take bath from the water of the two Kalashas. Then the 
parents, dressed in white clothes and with white sandal paste, besmeared 
on their foreheads, should give a cow with calf, as a Dakshina to the chief 
priest and feed the other priests and Brahmins, according to one‟s means. 
Lastly, after reciting the „Yatapapan‟ etc. (see verse 19) Mantra, the father, 
mother and the child should see the reflection of their faces in the (melted) 
Ghī. By the performance of the remedial rites in the manner described all 
evil effects of the birth during Abhukta Mula are completely wiped out. 
Ch. 94. Remedies from Jyeshtha Gandanta Birth 
1-5. The Sage said. O Maitreya! Now I will describe to you the remedial 
measures to be adopted to ensure relief from the evil effects of Jyeshtha 
Gandanta. The erection of a canopy (Mandhup), installation of Kalash, 
selection of a priest etc. will be done in the same manner, as has been 
recommended for the Abhukta Mula in the previous chapter. In this 
ceremony Indra will be the deity-in -chief, Adhideva will be Agni and the 
Pratyadhideva will be Rakshasa. 
6. Then the remedial rites should be performed in the following order. 
Install on a Kalash, full of paddy rice, an idol of gold with Indra, seated on 
Airavat with Vajra Ankusha in his hands. Perform worship of the chief deity 
Indra along with that of the Adhideva and the Pratyadhideva with the 
recitation of their appropriate Mantras. Perform Havan, Abhisheka and then 
feed the Brahmins in accordance with one‟s means. In addition to the 
above, after doing Indrasukta and Mrityunjaya Japas, prayers may be offered to Indra. These measures will wipe out the evil effects of the 
Ganda nta. 
7. In case the performance of remedial rites, described above, is beyond 
the means of any person, he should give a cow in charity. This will also 
appease the deities and promote relief from the evil effects of the 
Gandanta. Because the giving of a cow in charity has been considered a 
superior remedial measure than giving in charity all the lands, belonging to 
a person. 
8-9. According to prescribed remedial measures, 3 cows are to be given in 
charity in the case of Jyeshtha-Mula and Aslesha-Magha Gandantas, 2 
cows in Revati-Ashvini Gandantas and 1 cow in other Gandantas, or in any 
inauspicious Yog. If cow, or cows are not available, their actual value 
should be given in cash to a Brahmin. 
10. A girl, born in Jyeshtha Nakshatr, destroys (is the cause of death of) the 
elder brother of her husband and a girl, born in fourth quarter of Vishaka 
Nakshatr, destroys her husband‟s younger brother. Therefore a cow should 
be given in charity at the time of the marriage of such girls to wipe out the 
above-mentioned evil effects. 
11-13. A boy, or girl, born in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th quarter of Aslesha Nakshatr, 
destroys his/her mother-in -law and a boy, or a girl, born in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd 
quarter of Mula Nakshatr, becomes the destroyer of his/her father-in -law. 
Therefore suitable measures, as may be possible within one‟s means, 
should be taken at the time of the marriage of such boys and girls. There 
will be no evil effect, if the husband has no elder brothers. 
Ch. 95. Remedies from Birth of a Daughter after Three 
Sons 
1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! I will now tell you about other kinds of 
inauspicious births. The birth of a daughter after the birth of three sons, or 
the birth of a son after the birth of three daughters is ominous for both the 
maternal and paternal families of such children. Therefore remedial 
measures, described below, may be taken to get deliverance from these 
evil effects. 3-9. The rites should be performed on the morning next to the last day of 
Sutak, or on any other auspicious day in the following order. After selecting 
a priest and some Brahmins to perform the remedial religious rites, the 
priest, after paying obeisance to the nine Grahas, should install four 
Kalashas on a heap of paddy, place the idols of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha 
and Indra, made of gold, on them and perform their worship in the 
prescribed manner. A Brahmin (an assistant of the priest), after taking bath 
etc., should recite four Rudra Suktas and the whole of Shanti Sukta. The 
priest should perform Havan with Samidha, Ghī and sesame seeds 1008, 
108, or 28 times with the recitation of the prescribed Mantras of Brahma, 
Vishnu, Mahesha and Indra. Svistkrata and Purnahuti and Abhisheka of the 
child with his family should be done and presents in cash should be given 
to the priest and his assistants, according to one‟s means. The Brahmins 
should be fed. The father and the mother of the child should see their 
reflections in the Ghī, kept in a bronze vessel. Lastly grains and clothes 
should be distributed to the poor and the needy. By the performance of the 
above remedial rites the evil effects are wiped out and the child and his 
parents etc. enjoy happiness. 
Ch. 96. Remedies from Unusual Delivery 
1-3. The Sage said. O Brahmin! I will now tell you about inauspicious and 
unusual deliveries by women, which are ominous for the village, town and 
the country. These may be of the following kinds. Delivery of a child 2, 3, or 
4 months earlier, or later from the approximate due date. Delivery of a child 
without hands, feet, or any other limbs, without head, or with two heads. 
Delivery of an animal-shaped being by a woman, or a human-shaped being 
by an animal. 
4-5. Deliveries of these kinds by women, or cows etc. in a house are 
ominous for all the members of the family, living there. Therefore remedial 
measures are essential for obtaining relief from their evil effects. The best 
remedial measure will be to abandon (turn out from the Bhava) such 
women and animals (cows, mares etc.). 
6-9. It is considered inauspicious for a girl to become pregnant, or to deliver 
a child in her 15th, or 16th year from birth. If a cow delivers, when Sūrya is in 
Simh, or a female buffalo delivers, when Sūrya is in Makar, they are 
disasterous to their owner and the person, who looks after them. Therefore 
either such cow, or buffalo should be given away to a Brahmin, or suitable remedial measures should be taken to escape from the above-mentioned 
evil effects. The remedial measures to be adopted are the same, as given 
in verses 3-9 in Ch. 95. 
10. Thus, whenever there is any kind of Aristha, adoption of appropriate 
remedial measures will ensure long life, happiness and prosperity for the 
person concerned. 
Ch. 97. Conclusion 
1-4. Maharishi Parasara said. O Brahmin! I have described to you the 
Jyotish Shastra, as narrated by Lord Brahma to the Sage Narada and by 
Narada to Shaunaka and other Sages, from whom I received the 
knowledge of this Shastra. I have narrated the same Jyotish Shastra, which 
I learnt from them. Do not impart the knowledge of this Shastra to one, who 
is insignificative, slanders, or calumniates others, nor to one, who is not 
intelligent, is wicked and unknown to you. Teach this supreme Vedanga 
Jyotish Shastra only to one, who is gentle and amiable, devoted, truthful, 
brilliant and well known to you. 
5-6. Only that person, who possesses adequate knowledge of time and the 
positions of Grahas and Nakshatras, can understand this Hora Shastra. 
Only that person, who has complete knowledge of the Hora Sastra and 
who is truthful, can make correct favourable, or unfavourable predictions. 
7. One, who reads, or listens with attention and devotion to this most 
excellent Hora Shastra, becomes long-lived and is blessed with increase in 
his strength, wealth and good reputation.
