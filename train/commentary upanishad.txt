The increasino- interest evinced bythethinking
world inthePliilo.soj)hy andReligion oftheHindus
haslednietoundertake thepublication ofthetransla-
tionoftheprincipal Upanishads.
The special feature ofthisjtublication isthe trans-
lation oftheconiinentary ofSriSankaracharya, the-
oreatest exponent oftheAdvaita system ofphilosoi)hy.
Thework hasbeenundertaken chiefly with aview
tobring within easy reach of.the ?]nglish-reading

thelight oftheinterpretation ofSriSankaracharya.
The spirit ofthetextandofthe interjn-etation has,
throughout been faithfully adhered toand, perhaps, in
some instances, even tothedetriment ofelegance in
diction.
Iftheearnest student findsanytheleast help from
thiswork, thepublication willbeami)ly justified.

Adoration totht^Brdhitmn. Thelaardras beginning
with I8nv<i8y<iiiii, etc.,have notbeen utilized inritnals,
because they serve the puriK).se ofenlightening uson
thetruenature oftheAtman who isnotan(uu/d of
i.e.,notconnected with. Karma. Tlie true nature of
theAtrtian consists, aswillbedescribed, initsjiurity
being untouched bysin,oneness, being eternal, having
nobody, oiiini|aesence, etc.,andasthat conflicts with

WITH SHISANKAKA's COMMENTARY. 5
Should onewish tolive ahundred years onthis
earth, heshould livedoin«^ Kdrtita. While thus, (as)
man, you live, there isnoway other than thisby
whichKarma willnot t'lin«>; toyou.(2).
Ooiu.—Thus the drift oftheVedio text is
thathewhoknows theAtniaii should renounce the
three-fold desire ofson, etc.,and save hisAtman by
hein^ centred intheknowledge ofthe^4<//t<f7i((r ii/t>i/fc-
nishtha). TheinAiutras nowpnx'eed toinculcate the
folU)win^' forthebenefit ofhimwhodoesnotknow the
Atman and isnotcom))etent toco»>;ni/e theAtnui nas
above indicated.
Kurvaniieva means certainly doinjif, i.e.,'onlyby

means'should like tolive.' Satariisamah means*a
hundred years,' Ithasbeen declared that that isa
man's lony;est life. Thus declarin<; a<;reeably to
natural inclination thedesire toli\eahundred yeais,
thetext laysdown theinjunction inrespect ofhow
oneshoidd live—ccmtinually ])erformin<; Karriia and

which one isinterdicted from returnin*"' thence—thus

twocourses willalsobepointed out. (TheXarayana

"Kenunciation (Xyasd) certainly istobepreferred."
Bhugavan Vyasd, thepi-eceptor oftheVedas, after
much discussion told hissonhisfirmconviction inthe
following- text."These then arethetworoadsonwhich
theVedas arebased. Both thecourses—onewhich
leads toKarma andtheother which draws away from
Kariua havebeen explained, etc." This division will
beexplained.

Smritis secures for liini the southeni route and
return toSamsavd. Activity following natural impul-
sesandrepugnant tothe S(t8iiyi8 entails degi'adation
intolow birtlis from beasts down toinnnovable.s. The
Sriiti says :'*Travelling byneither ofthese two
paths, these small creatures areconstantly returning,
ofwhom itmay besaid :"Hel)ornand die/ This is
thethird course." Another Si'uti says''Tlie three
kinds ofliving beings (going byneither ofthese two
paths) reach this miserable state." The desire to
know theBrahman sjirings only intheperson whose
mind is})ure.who isfreefrom desires andwho, free
fromdeeds done inthis birth orinj)revious ones,
liecomes disgusted with the external, ephemeral
medley ofendsandmeans. ThisBrahrudn isdej)ict-
edintheUpanishad beginning with Kenesliitam,
etc.,appearing intheform ofcpiestions and answers.
Katdka says''The self-existent hasmade thesenses
external intheir activity andman therefore looks
outward, notatthe self within." Some wiseman
having turned hiseyesinward and being desirous of
immortality sawtheinner self. "Having examined

notmade canbereached byKarma. Inorder to

contemplate andacquire knowledge oftlie inner self.
Bytheknowledge oftheinner self,ignorance, whicli.
istheseed ofbondage, andthecause ofKantia per-
formed forthe realisation ofdesires, isentirely
removed. Tlie Srutis say :*'Theie isnogrief

cut, alldoubts are i-esol\ed and allJud'tiid iscon-

Ifitbeurged that even byknowledge c<)Ui)le(l

Knowledge, theworld ofthedeities ;"thusshowing
howthethree worlds different from theAtnum are
reached. Inthesame place wefind the following-
reason urged foronebecoming aSanyaain :"What
shall we,towhom this world isnottheAtrnan^ do

wedowith offspring. Karma, andKnowledge combined
witliKarma, which arethemeans tosecure the
world ofthemortals, theworld ofthemanes, andthe
world ofthe(iods ;andwhich donothelp usin

ofthethree worlds, transitory andattainable bythese
means, isdesirable. Tousthat world alone which is
natural, unborn, undecaying, immortal, fearless and
neither augmented nordiminished byKarma, and
eternal, iscovetable;andthat being eternal cannot
besecured byanyother means than theremoval of
ig-norance. Therefore, therenunciation ofalldesires
preceded bytheknowledge oftheBrahrnan who is
theinner Selfshould alone be])ractised byus.An-
other reason isthat theknowledge oftheinner Self
isantagonistic toKm'Ttut andcannot therefore co-
exist with it. Itiswellknown that theknowledge

such as,bywhat sortofadirector and liywhat sortof

Both these objections areunsound. From themere

If.however, itbeur<>ed that tliemind itself, asevery

andthat tliecjuestion isitself inelevant, theargument
isuntenable. Ifthe7nind were independt^nt inthe
