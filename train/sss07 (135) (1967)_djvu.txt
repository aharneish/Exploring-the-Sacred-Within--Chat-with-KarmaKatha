Sathya Sai Speaks 


Baaba says his discourse is a 'mixture' prepared and prescribed by the physician to cleanse, cure 
and make us 'whole'-some. He calls them Sambhaashan, Dialogue, Conversation. 


He does not hesitate, hum and haw. 

He does not calculate, pause and ponder. 
Collecting, selecting thoughts and words, 

He seeks no notes or quotes, 

He does not tarry, decorating speech 

With flowery frills, dressing borrowed phrase 

In shimmering gloss. He is no orator 
Publicity-prone. He does not declaim, circumlocute, 
Or even, speak. He talks to you and you and you 
And every single you, sitting there, 

The Arjuns, willing to reach but afraid to march. 

He talks on the task ahead and the Truth within. 

The impact of Baaba's discourses on the listeners is profoundly positive. 
His talk, they find, is cooling, not freezing; 
Warming, not scorching; raining, not raging; 
Healing the ailing and hearts bewailing; 

Soothing, not searing, totally tonic; 

Balming and calming; bettering, no frittering, 
Impelling inquiry, compelling assent, 

Dispelling dejection, repulsing reluctance, 


Infusing faith, fusing fissions, defusing revenge, 


Informing, so charming, never harming, disarming. 
Shifting the responding, lifting the despondent, 
Sound waves spreading Love, speedier than Light. 
As you hear His words you quietly resolve 

To take a step forward on the pilgrim road... 
Unfold your wings, explore the sky 


And seek regions beyond your ken. 


He is welcoming all who are thirsting and starving 


Or limping and groaning or climbing and sliding. 


Raising the stooping, bracing the drooping! 
He opens the eye and strengthens the limb, 
Awakening the sleeping, the sitting to stand, 
The standing to walk, the walking to march, 


The marching to reach, the reaching to merge. 


1. Milk and Water 


THIS day is celebrated in India too, as New Year Day, in accordance with the observance of 
Western countries, whose calendar begins the New Year on the first day of January. But if you 
only ponder for a minute, you will realise that every second is new. Every second marks a new 
birth; it is a fresh chance for achieving a new victory. For, the goal as envisaged by Indian 
culture is the realisation of the Aathma by the individual, not the acquisition of wealth or 
scholarship or fame. The chief duty of man is investigation into Truth. Truth can be won only 
thorough dedication and devotion. And they are dependent on the Grace of God, which is 
showered only on hearts saturated with Love. 


The question, "Where does God exist," is often trotted out by people nowadays. By unceasing 
recitation of the Name of God, Prahlaadha knew that God is everywhere; it is not correct to 
assert, "He is only here" or that "He is not there." The realisation of this Truth can come only 
after intense saadhana (spiritual practice). You may see all kinds of attractive articles in a 
departmental store; they cannot be yours merely for the asking. Only those articles for which you 
pay the price can be secured by you. Realisation may be an attractive article for you to carry 
home with you; but, you have to pay the price. It cannot be yours if you have only argument of 
appeals in your possession. 


Strive for freedom from dependance on passions 


You deserve to be a king only if you are the undisputed monarch of a kingdom. When you are 
fleeing from the throne, pursued by foes, how can the dignity of that status be appropriate for 
you? So too, it is only when you have defeated the inner foes of lust, greed, hate and pride, and 
secured undisputed mastery over yourself, that you can ascend the Throne and claim to be the 
Master. 


In India, we say we have won Swaraajya (Freedom); but, Swaaraajya (identification with the 
self-effulgent Brahman) is the status we should each aspire to win. Swaraajya is political 
independence, freedom from the humiliating yoke of an alien ruler. Swaaraajya is freedom from 
the degrading dependence on passions and emotions. When external shackles are broken we have 
Swaraajya. When internal shackles are broken we have Swaaraajya. Swaaraajya alone can 
ensure peace and joy. 


God is not far from you, or away in some distant place. He is within you, in your own inner altar. 
Man suffers because he is unable to discover Him there, and draw peace and joy from that 
discovery. A dhobi, standing knee-deep in a flowing river, washing clothes therein, died of thirst, 
because he failed to realise that life-giving water was within reach. He need only bend and drink. 
Such is the story of man. He runs about in desperate haste, to seek God outside him and dies 
disappointed and distraught, without reaching the goal---only to be born again. 


Of course, you have to be in the world, but you." need not be of it. The attention has to be fixed 
on God, the God within. In the Kannada country, there is a festival called Karaga. The central 
figure of this holy rite keeps many pots on his head, one over the other, and moves in the 
procession, keeping step with the music; he has also to sing in tune with the rest and keep time to 
the beat of the drum. But, all the while, he has his attention fixed on balancing the precarious 
tower on his head. So, too, man must keep the Goal of God-realisation before him, while 


engaged in the noisy, hilarious procession of life. 
Jnaana can be won with a pure mind only 


Some people are envious of the high standard of living reached by the rich nations, but the 
poverty of India is much more congenial to the good life than the luxurious and vainglorious life 
of the West. The sea has a vast expanse of water, but can it quench the thirst of man? Similarly, 
however much a man may possess, if he has not cultivated detachment, it is but arid waste. 
Detachment from sensual pleasures and objective pursuits helps the growth of Love towards God 
and the Godly. 


People boast that they are interested only in inquiry and reason, that they follow only the path of 
jnaana (spiritual knowledge). They aspire to be jnaanis (liberated persons possessing spiritual 
knowledge)! But jnaana cannot be won without a pure mind. He must discover who he is, before 
he ventures upon the inquiry, "Who is God?" Once he has discovered who he is, there is no need 
to know who is God, for, both are the same. 


When you come to know that God is in you, you will value yourself much more, for when a man 
knows that the piece of 'glass' he has picked up is a diamond, he will keep it in an iron safe, for 
better security. When a boulder has been carved by a sculptor into a charming idol of God, it will 
be prized high and installed in a magnificent temple and worshipped with ritual ceremony by 
generations. 


The wrong notion that the world is real and that you are the body has been so deeply implanted 
in you through birth after birth, that it can be removed only by means of a very potent drug, 
administered continuously. The drug, Raam Raam Raam, is to be swallowed and assimilated ad 
infinitum. Its curative essence will travel into every limb, every sense, every nerve and every 
drop of blood. Every particle of you will be transmuted into Raam. You must melt in the crucible 
and be poured into the Raam mould and become Raam. That is the fruition of jnaana 
Raamanaama or any other Name if chanted and absorbed in the mind, will help control the 
vagaries of the senses which drag you away into vanities. 


Conquer inner foes, triumph over your ego 


There is a vast difference between India five centuries ago, and India today, in the field of sense- 
control. Today, the senses are allowed free play; man is a slave to greed, lust and egoism. The 
fault lies entirely with the parents and the elders. When their children go to temples or religious 
discourses, they reprimand them and warn them that it is a sign of insanity. They tell them that 
religion is an old-age pursuit; it should not be taken seriously by youngsters! But, if only they 
encourage them, the children can equip themselves better for the battle of life. Parents ought to 
advise the children: "Be convinced that there is a God, guiding and guarding us. Remember Him 
with gratitude. Pray to Him to render you pure. Love all; serve all. Join good company. Visit 
temples and holy men." You read in the papers of campaigns, conquests, victories, triumphs, etc., 
but they are all material conquests and other triumphs. Campaign against the temptations of the 
senses; conquer inner foes; triumph over your ego. That is the Victory for which you deserve 
congratulations, not the others. That is what I referred to as Swaaraajya. 


The year becomes new, the day becomes holy, when you sanctify it by saadhana, not otherwise. 
Saadhana can grow only in a field fertilised by Love. Love or Prema is the sine qua non of 
bhakthi (devotion to God). The love you have towards material objects, name, fame, wife and 
children, etc., should be sanctified by being subsumed by the more overpowering Love of God. 


Add two spoons of water to two seers of milk, the water too is appreciated as milk! At present 
your saadhana can be described only as mixing two litres of water with two spoons of milk! 
Have the Love of God filling and thrilling your heart; then, you cannot hate any one, you cannot 


indulge in unhealthy rivalries, you will not find fault with any one. Life becomes soft, sweet and 
smooth. 


Shri Sathya Sai Mandali, Guindy, Madras, 1-1-1967 


Butter is in every drop of milk; chicken is in every part of the egg. 
So too, God is in every part of the Universe. He is the strength; He 
is the substance; He is the sustenance. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


2. Stagnation in the same class 


WHEN the Sun, the Deity that inspires the Vision, moves North, man too must develop the 
Northward or the Divine urge and engage himself in tasks that will take him nearer to God. That 
is the meaning of dividing the year into two---the Southward half and the Northward half. But 
that is just a warning and an exhortation. Man can overcome the limitations of South and North; 
he has always, throughout the year, the Northward or the Divine urge driving him onward and 
upward. He need not wait for the Makarasankraanthi (starting of Sun's Northward journey) or 
stop with the Karkatakasankraanthi (starting of Sun's Southward jourmey). All spiritual 
endeavour has as its aim the attraction of the Grace of God on ourselves. That is why when you 
go to a temple and stand before the main shrine, you strike the bell hung there; the sound will 
draw the attention of the Lord to the supplicant just arrived. The bell must be accompanied by a 
sincere prayer from the heart. 


Spiritual effort should not becomes mechanical repetition of set formulae or execution of dry 
formalities. A sage who lived long ago had a cat in his hermitage; whenever he performed a 
homa (offering oblations to gods into the consecrated fire), the cat frisked about the Fire and 
gave a lot of trouble to him. So he used to catch it in advance and keep it under an inverted 
basket for the duration of the homa. His son who watched this operation for years thought that 
this cat-catching and cat-imprisonment were vital parts of the ritual itself. So he took great 
trouble to seek out a cat before every homa and felt happy when he got one which he could keep 
under an inverted basket in the same room. That is an example of meaningless 
mechanicalisation. 


Maintain inner equanimity with all your strength 


It is Maayaa (illusion) that makes man take the Naama and Ruupa (the name and the form) as 
real. Attachment is born out of this Maayaa only. It acts like a veil to hide the reality behind all 
this multiplicity. Maayaa is the vesture of Maadhava (God); he who believes it to be true is 
Maanava (Man). By saadhana, a man can escape from the enticement of Maaya and realise that 
it is all false, for it does not subsist for all time. Potharaaju knew that all is God: he writes that 
the Bhaagavatha was composed by the God in him. He is the One in all; Maam ekam---Me, the 
only One---as the Geetha says; he surrendered fully to God. Shrinaatha his brother-m-law, 
himself a great poet, pleaded with Potharaaju to dedicate his Bhaagavatha to the King, who was 
certain to reward him with heaps of precious gems. But Potharaaju brushed him aside; how can 
any one have a ride in two boats at the same time, he asked Shrinaatha. His mind refused to 
wander away from the feet of Raama, where it had tasted nectar. 


Gopanna too had no other thought than the beautification of the residence of Raama, and the 
service of Raama, at Bhadhraachalam. Thyaaga (renunciation) alone can grant the immortality of 
merging in God. You must be unaffected, ever in calm joy, in the inner depths; it does not matter 
if the waves play on the top, heaving and falling, for that is but the action of wind upon water! 
Do not lose the inner equanimity; maintain it with all your strength. 


Three classes of devotion 


How long can you stagnate in the same class? Have you no wish to get promoted to the next 
higher class? In Bhakthi (devotion), there are two classes, Sahajabhakthi and Viseshabhakthi. 
Sahajabhakthi is satisfied with worship, bhajan, naamasmaran, vratha (group singing, remem- 
brance of Lord, vow-keeping), pilgrimage, etc. Viseshabhakthi craves for purity of character, 


suppression of impulses, practice of daya, prema, shaanthi, ahimsa (compassion, love, peace and 
non-violence), etc., and inquiry into the why and wherefore of man. It is a matter of shame that 
people stick to the same class year in and year out. Then there is another higher class named 
Paraabhakthi, too. Cleverness can correct and solve external problems; concentrated saadhana 
alone can correct and solve internal crisis. 


Four friends once started dealing in cotton. They had a godown for the storage of the bales; 
finding that the cotton seeds attracted rats into the godown, a cat was introduced by them to scare 
the rodent throng. They tied jingles to her feet and since they loved it much, the jingles were of 
gold! Once, when the cat jumped from the top of the pile of bales, it started limping on one foot. 
So they applied some balm and tied a long strip of bandage round the injured foot. The bandage 
got loose and the cat unaware of the long narrow cloth she was trailing behind her, sat near the 
fireplace. When the cloth began to burn, she ran helter-skelter and fled into the godown itself, 
where the entire stock of cotton was reduced to ahses in a trice. The four friends had assigned to 
themselves each one of the feet of the joint cat and the injured foot belonged to one Of them; so 
the other three charged him with the damages which they claimed from him. 


The six enemies that threaten man's domain 


The matter went to court and after hearing arguments on both sides, the judge said, "The injured 
leg has no responsibility, for it was taken into the godown with the trail of fire by the three 
healthy feet. So, damages have to be paid by the owners of the healthy feet to the owner of the 
limping foot." What may thus appear correct at first sight, might prove wrong on second 
thoughts. There is a correctness from the worldly point of view and a correctness from God's. 
Find out what the point of view of God would be, by association with godly men; they can give 
you proper advice. You should seek and not avoid good men. 


In the months of Shravan and Bhaadhrapadh, the crops are thirsty in the fields; but man is ever 
afflicted with thirst of a different kind, to drink the poisonous water of sensual pleasure. 


Each one is entitled to a crown after the surrender, the total surrender, of the six enemies that 
threaten his domain! kaama, krodha, lobha, moha, madha and maathsarya (lust, anger, greed, 
delusion, pride and envy). He wears a crown with these foes still formidable inside him and 
carries not gems on his brow, but stones. 


He is coolly carrying stone. The real coronation is that of Vibheeshana, performed under the 
auspices of Raama, a status won through surrender and sacrifice. 


A tube in the bicycle tyre is punctured by nails on the track; "I" and "Mine" are two nails that 
puncture the progress of man. Viveka and Vairaagya (discrimination and detachment) are the two 
aides-de-camp of man. Keep them strong and give them full facility, for they help man to live 
unharmed and joyful. There was a son who, when asked by his father what course he would like 
to take after his school certificate, replied, "the Race Course." That is the consequence of not 
having these body guards. 


Feel the Presence of God, revel in His Glory 


When Krishna leapt down from his chariot with Chakraayudha (the wheel-weapon) in His hand 
to slay Bheeshma, Arjuna jumped down with Him and holding both His Feet, he prayed, "Oh 
Lord, you have given word that you will not wield any weapon. Let it not be said that you broke 
your word to save me from Bheeshma; I am prepared to die." That was the measure of his 
bhakthi. Bheeshma too had equal bhakthi. He did not step forward to fight the new challenge, 


nor did he question the Lord. He stood silent, drinking in the charm of the Lord and filling 
himself with the vision of the magnificence of God. That was the measure of his dedication to 
His Will. 


Become attached to God. Feel His Presence, revel in His Glory. Do not cause Him 
'disappointment' or 'distress' by any act or word which He does not approve. Do not give Him the 
slightest 'bother' or 'worry.' He has none, but if you love Him deeply, you will be concerned 
about Him, just as if He is your Lord and Love. Jataayu had an unremitting stream of Raama- 
thoughts and he was rewarded by Raama; He came to him in his last moments and Himself 
performed his last rites, a duty He did not carry out directly even for His father! 


When Krishna returned from the court of Duryodhana, after His Mission for Peace on behalf of 
the Paandava brothers, Sahadeva told Him: "Pardon us, Oh Lord. I knew the rogues would not 
pay heed; I would fain have stopped you from proceeding to their den, but you were so kind." 
God will serve you; He will save you and be by your side ever---only you have to cultivate your 
character and polish your interior so that He might be reflected therein. 


Sweetness alone is the offering that God likes 


Let His Will be done---this should be your guide-line. The Emperor of the Cholas sought to visit 
the Shrirangam Gopuram Temple, of which he had heard much. He got his chariot ready and 
moved forward many times in six months; but every time a recluse in ochre robes with a rosary 
round his neck and a halo around his head intercepted the vehicle. When the emperor alighted to 
honour him, he kept him engaged in conversation which was so enchanting that he forgot his 
journey and its goal. 


One day, when he lamented over his failure to fill his eyes with the glory of Shrirangam, the 
Lord appeared before him and said. "Why do you lament? I am the Master who came to you so 
often as soon as you set out for Shrirangam; recognise Me in all, that is the genuine pilgrimage to 
Shrirangam." Consider all whom you meet as the Lord of Shrirangam, your Master. Show 
untarnished Prema towards all who come to you. 


What is the service that the ocean with all its mass of water does? It cannot slake the thirst of 
single human being. What is the profit if a miser lives a hundred years? This is My message to 
you this day: Do not exhibit anger or grief or pain. Be happy, spread happiness around you. 
Sweetness alone is the offering that God likes. 


There was a man once who hired an aged elephant for the bridal procession on the occasion of 
the marriage of his daughter. After the ceremony, when the procession returned home, the bride 
descended from the howdah and at that very moment, the elephant crumpled and died. The 
owner of the elephant was shocked at the news; he refused to take it as an unavoidable 
misfortune. He insisted that the identical animal had to be returned to him alive. He went to court 
on this issue. The judge had some mud pots kept at the back of the door which the greedy owner 
had to open for passing through. When he opened it, the whole lot was broken. The judge 
insisted that he had to restore those very pots! Thus was sense driven into that fellow's brain. 


Do not have this type of stupid fanaticism; modify its rigour by a little discrimination. Be 
reasonable, considerate, sympathetic, full of toleration of the other points of view. Improve 
yourselves day by day in these matters. That is My Blessing for you today. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, Uttharaayana, 14-1-1967 


Just as you prescribe minimum qualifications for every profession, 
the minimum qualification for Grace is surrender of egoism, 


control over senses and regulated aahaara and vihaara (food and 
recreation). 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


3. Lamps lit from the same flame 


YOUR sister from America was telling you about her experiences as a practitioner and teacher of 
yoga. There are two roads to fulfilment’ Praarthana and Dhyaana---Prayer and Meditation. 
Prayer makes you a supplicant at the Feet of God; meditation induces God to come down to you 
and inspires you to raise yourselves to Him. It tends to make you come together, not place one in 
a lower level and the other on a higher. Dhyaana is the royal road to liberation from bondage, 
though by prayer too, you earn the same fruit. Meditation needs concentration, after controlling 
the claims of the senses. You have to picture before your inner eye the Form on which you have 
elected to contemplate. Or, as Indhra Devi has said now and as she is teaching her pupils in the 
West, you can elect to meditate on a Flame, a steady straight Flame of Light. Picture it as 
spreading on all sides, becoming bigger and bigger; enveloping all and growing in you, until 
there is nothing else except light. In the glory of that all-enveloping Light, all hate and envy, 
which are the evil progeny of darkness, will vanish. Know that the same jyothi or light is in all. 
Even he, whom you were treating as your worst rival, has the selfsame light in his innermost 
heart. 


Be brothers in pilgrimage with all others 


When you see in a house, on the walls of the shrine room a picture of Mine, do you not feel a 
wave of reverence and kinship, surging within you? You may not like him for any other reason, 
but this picture will bring him closer to you though the owner of the house may be your rival in 
the professional field. So, too, know that every other person has in his heart of hearts a picture of 
the God you revere. Recognise it and reconcile your misunderstandings; close up all gaps and be 
brothers in pilgrimage, encouraging and inspiring each other along the arduous road. 


Or, if you have Me as the object of meditation, sit in a comfortable pose, which is neither 
irksome nor flopping, let your mind dwell for some time on some good sthothras (hymns) or 
incidents from the sacred stories, so that the senses escaping into the tangles of worldly worries 
may be quietened and subdued. Then, with the Name on the tongue, try to draw with the brush of 
your emotion and the hand of your intellect, a picture of Swaami, slowly, from the cluster of hair 
to the face and neck downwards, spending time in contemplating each as it is getting drawn and 
when the picture is full, start from the feet up to the head again, so that your attention is never for 
a moment diverted from the Form you love to meditate upon. 


By this means, it can never go astray. When a golden image is made of Ganesha, for example, 
the head is gold, the feet are gold, the silk cloth that is worn is also gold. Every part of the picture 
drawn is Divine. That picture must, by this process of deep concentration, be imprinted on the 
heart, so that like picture printed on paper, it cannot be peeled off or erased. Do not change the 
pose in which you have started picturing; do not draw today a Swaami sitting and tomorrow a 
Swaami standing or walking or talking. If it is Krishna, do not change from a Toddler-Krishna 
with butter in His palm to a Cowherd-Krishna with a Flute, or with the Govardhanagiri raised 
over His head or a Geethacharya as the Charioteer. Have one Form; that is ample help. 


Delusion of 'two' should disappear, all is one 


Invitations are sent out, bands strike music, flags are hung, guests are fed, announcements are 
made---all with the intention of having many witnesses for the marriage of the groom with the 
bride. Similarly, festivals, holy days, vows, rites, pilgrimages, fasts are to invoke the blessings of 
the good and the godly upon the marriage of the soul with the Oversoul. The fundamental rite is 


simple; the recognition by the soul that it is the Oversoul overcome by the illusion that it is not. 
That is the stage of Samaadhi, equal awareness, equipoise, levelness of consciousness devoid of 
ups and downs. 


Indhra Devi will instruct you in yoga practices but I wish to emphasise that great care is to be 
taken to keep the mind of the student of yoga free from blemish. The mind is like a camera; 
when the lens is turned against any object and clicked, the picture of that thing gets printed on 
the slide. So, be ever vigilant; turn it always towards the holiest of objects, God, and click. 


When the holy Ganga is near, why wallow in the cesspool? Contemplate on God in any form and 
stay pure. 


Merge yourself with the whole of creation; allow the whole of creation to enter the portals of 
your mind in one happy joyful family re-union. Envy, which like a mistletoe saps vitality out of 
all Saadhana, can creep in only when you feel your neighbour as different, distinct, disturbing. 
You do not feel your hand as a nuisance, because it is yours, a part of you. Your neighbour is 
also as much you. All men are lamps lit from the same flame which is God. 


From one tiny seed, the giant banyan tree bearing billions of tiny seeds is born. God alone knows 
the secret of His mighty Majesty. Out of the one seed called Brahma, all this Universe has 
emanated, with each country as its branches and each individual as one single seed. That is why 
it is said that /shwara resides in the region of the heart in all beings. The seed is hard inside the 
fruit; when the fruit gets rotten, the seed does not rot. The Aathma is unaffected by changes in 
the complexion of the body. Man has come with a definite allotment of time to engage himself in 
activities which will award him Liberation and merge him in the Universal of which he is a drop. 
Remember this mission. 


See that you are strong and unshakable inside 


Time, regularity of time, is an important factor in dhyaana or yogic practice. Stick to the same 
time every day. If for any reason, say, a train journey, you are Unable to keep to the schedule, 
remember at the same hour Prashaanthi Nilayam, recall to memory the thrill of dhyaana there at 
that hour and fill yourselves with the holiness. That will give as much joy as real dhyaana at 
Prashaanthi Nilayam. Know that the external is only the reflection of the internal. The bimba 
(object) is inside and the external world is but its prathi-bimba (images). See the Lord within; 
see the world as the reflections He casts. This jnaana (spiritual wisdom) alone grants liberation-- 
-Jnaanaath eva thu kaivalyam. 


Of what profit is it to plaster all the wall space in your home with pictures of Swaami when He is 
not installed in your heart? You declare that Swaami is Sarvaantharyaami---that He moves, from 
inside, every thought word and deed. You; cry out, "Swaami, are you not aware of my grief?." 
You do' not cry out, "Swaami, are you not aware of my errors?" These you dare hide from Me, as 
if I do not know! Such devotion is just show, arranged for exhibition only. You may have a 
finely painted door; but if it has been eaten by white ants inside, it will disintegrate at the first 
knock; it cannot stand weight or pressure. See that you are strong, hard, unshakable inside; 
outside polish is not needed. Let the roots penetrate deep into the real core of your being. 


How to meditate on the Lamp and the Flame 


The aspirant who goes along the path of bhakthi finds at the gate of the mansion of the Lord, the 
Mastiff, maaya, blocking his entry. He has to cry out in his helplessness, "Swaami, come and 
take me in," so that the Lord, out of His divine pity, comes down, pushes the Mastiff aside and 


gives him lasting refuge in His Presence. The jnaani (liberated person), on the other hand, 
overcomes the Mastiff by becoming himself the same as the Master. 


Indhra Devi said that when you meditate on the Lamp and the Flame, you must visualise that the 
Light spreads and illumines the parents, kinsmen and later, friends and even enemies. There is no 
need to remind yourselves of physical relationships, which are causal; convince yourselves that 
the light within you is spreading all around you, encompassing all, lighting millions of lamps in 
all lands and climes. Remove the hardness, the imperviousness that hides and smothers the light 
inside you; that is the most difficult and the most essential task for the aspirant. The 
Aathmajyothi (Light of Self) will shine only when the Dhehabhraanthi (false idea of body) is 
absent. How can the Aathma shine when you identify yourselves with material encasement? 


The reality is Param-aathma (Super Consciousness) only. It had the first inkling of desire 
Ekoham bahusyaam---"Being One, let many become"; and all this manifested from It, of It, by It. 
For there was nothing other than It. This body is like the earthen lamp, in which the impulses 
inherited from previous births are the oil and the ego is the wick. When Jnaana lights it up, the 
oil is consumed more and more quickly and the lamp burns brighter and brighter. Finally, when 
all the oil is exhausted, the wick too is burnt out. The earthen lamp is then thrown away and 
becomes dust. 


Do not be harsh towards anyone 


Do not try to start as an adept in social service unless you have won this Aanandha and Shaanthi 
yourself. First self; then, help. Love is God; live in Love. People ride on elephants into wild life 
sanctuaries to watch elephants! Being on elephants they seek elephants somewhere else. So, too, 
man being himself the residence of God, seeks God outside himself, in the complex 
entanglements of Nature. See your IJshtadhaivam (chosen Deity) in all. Raamakrishna 
Paramahamsa did not disturb the cat when it drank the milk offering placed before Mother Kaali 
in the temple. He saw it as the Mother. When Kumaaraswaamy saw a finger-nail mark on the 
cheek of Paarvathi, he was shocked; on enquiry, His Mother told him that he was himself the 
tormentor for he had pinched and scratched a cat while playing not knowing that all beings are 
the Mother in those forms. In every being there is Sai, so do not hate any one; do not be harsh 
towards any one. 


Do not unto another what you do not like to be done to yourself. For the other is really "you." 
Even if another uses foul language against you, be calm and sweet; say, "Oh, I am so surprised 
that my behaviour has given you that impression." Smile in return, do not take it to heart; remind 
yourself that even Swaami is not free from these peculiar beings who revel in falsehoods. Smile 
when you: hear these revilings and be calm. That is a sign of your meditation progressing fast. 


Preserve your physical and mental health 


Preserve your mental health by this supreme unconcern. Preserve your physical health also, for 
ill-health can be a great nuisance to the spiritual aspirant, a great handicap. The body will refuse 
to be ignored; it will thrust itself upon the attention, if it is beset with disease. The body is the 
car, the senses are the mechanical parts and through the petrol---the saadhana---you have to keep 
it going. When you have finished your meditation, do not get up all of a sudden. Loosen the 
tension slowly, massage the joints a little if necessary, after you have got rid of the tension, sit 
quietly at the same place and recall to your mind once again the thrill of dhyaana and repeat Om 
Shaanthih, Shaanthih, Shaanthih, feeling the Peace within you. 


Today is Tuesday, called Mangala-vaara, the auspicious day. It is called so because Hanumaan 
conveyed the good tidings of Raama coming to rescue her on that day to Seetha; she declared, 
"Let this day be named Mangala from now on." This was the day of the week when Raavana, the 
evil force that caused much terror, was overpowered by Raama and killed. So, I bless that you 
too will overpower and destroy the wrong tendencies and attitudes and progress fast on the path 
of saadhana. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 22-1-1967 


4. The trail of wings 


WHAT Indhra Devi has said is nothing new in this country, and for us. In fact, she learnt the 
elements of yoga here and she is making many lives happy and peaceful in the West through 
yoga. Her campaign of Light in Darkness is only the Sanaathana Dharma ideal of 'Thamaso maa 
jvothir gamaya'---"From darkness lead me into light." It is really surprising that any one should 
train people in concentration; for without concentration, no task can be accomplished by man. To 
drive a car, shape a pot on a wheel, weave a design, weed a plot of land---all these jobs require 
single-minded attention. To walk along life's highway which is full of hollows and mounds, to 
talk to one's fellowmen who are of manifold temperaments, all these require concentration. The 
senses have to be reined in so that they may not distract or disturb; the brain must not go wool- 
gathering; the emotions must not colour or discolour the objectives one seeks. That is the way to 
succeed in concentration. 


Yoga 1s chiththa vriththi nirodha---the cutting off of all agitations on the lake of one's inner 
consciousness. Nothing should cause a wave of emotion or passion on the calm surface or in the 
quiet depths of one's awareness. This state of equanimity is the hall-mark of Jnaana (spiritual 
wisdom). Saadhana (Spiritual discipline) is the drug and Vichaara (Inquiry) is the regimen that 
will cure man of all waywardness and agitation. 


Become aware that you are the Light 


The process of meditation on the Light of the Lamp which Indhra Devi has told you has to be 
understood thus first feel that you are in the Light; then, proceed to the realisation that the Light 
is in you; later, become aware that you are the Light, no more, no less. But it is easier and better 
to project the light which you first visualise within you, to the outside world, illumining, more 
and more of the world, and visualising them all as soaked in the Divine Glory that is in you too. 
When you feel you are all Light, you will have no weight; everything will be bright. That is why 
on the Prashaanthi Flag, the Aathma-jyothi is represented as emanating from _ the 
Hridhayakamala when the Lotus blooms at the first touch of the rays of the Sun, Jnaana. 


You can have other things besides Light to overcome the darkness. Anything that awakens the 
awareness of the Universal---the Infinite, the Immanent, the Transcendent, All pervasive, Vast, 
Brahman---is beneficial. You can have some Form of the Universal, like Krishna whose blue 
colour is redolent with the vast deep sky or sea. Contemplate on that Form, picture it in your 
mind, spend time slowly and with full attention on that holy picturisation .... peacock feather, the 
kasthuuri (black) dots, the brows, the eyes, the nose, the nose-stud of pearl, the mouth, lips, 
teeth, the flute-Oh, you can spend hours painting Him on the canvas of your heart. (Your 
attention will wander far in the initial stages, but do not lose heart). It is a very profitable 
exercise to sublimate your thoughts and feelings. Every minute spent in this dhyaana will take 
you one step nearer Liberation, nearer Mokshapuri, the 'City of God,' of Freedom from Bondage. 


Take everything as the Will of the Lord 


You are forsaking your real mother and attaching yourselves to the aayahs (maids) who fostered 
you. Your real mother is Sai, who has affection untouched by ego. That is why Raamakrishna 
cried out for Her and for Her grace. There is in every one an inner urge goading him forward to 
the merger in his own reality, as a river is led along to the sea by the compulsion of the flow. The 
pendulum will swing from fight to left, only when you wind the clock. Leave off winding, it will 
come to a halt. So too, the mind will waver from fight to wrong, from mirth to moan, only when 


you urge it on and encourage it. Desist from winding the mind; it will cease its antics. 


Do not count your tears of pain; do not pore over your griefs. Let them pass through your mind, 
as birds fly through the sky, leaving no trail behind; or as flames and floods appear on the screen 
in a picture-house, without singing or damping the screen. 


You must not lose heart when you are disappointed. Perhaps, your wish itself was wrong, or its 
realisation may have landed you in worse situations. Any way, it is the will of the Lord and He 
knows best. Disappointments and distress are like the skin of the plantain, to protect the taste and 
allow the sweetness to fill the fruit. In such dire straits, let your mind dwell on the splendour of 
the Aathma and its majesty; that will keep you alert and brave. The antics of the senses and the 
mind can be arrested by the whip of Aathmajnaana (wisdom of the true Self). 


Prayers to be offered daily 


Do this concentration of your reality every day in Dhyaana. Follow the same rigorous routine 
every day---time, place, duration, method, pose, all being unchanged. Then the disturbing factors 
can be easily humbled and tamed. As Raamakrishna said, do not dig a few feet in a number of 
different places and moan that you could not strike water. Dig in one place steadily and with 
faith. The boring drill goes down into the very underground spring of water; drill "Raam" 
"Raam" Raam"-continuously steadily, and you too can get the rewarding result of Realisation. 
"Raam" is the name of the drug; the disease will not be affected in the least when you simply 
repeat the name of the drug; it is only when the drug is taken in, that the disease gets scared and 
packs up to leave. As the jerks to the body, the japam (Contemplative repetition of sacred words) 
is to the mind. Jerks tone up the body, japam tones up the mind and drives out the evil viruses 
from it. The heart is the pot, intelligence is the churning rod, Saadhana (spiritual practice) is the 
process of churning and Realisation is the butter gained. 


If you plead that you have no time to spare for japam and Dhyaanam, I will say that it is but 
laziness that makes you argue so. How can any lower task claim the time that is legitimately the 
right of the one task for which man is born? Rise everyday as if you are rising from death. Say, 
Thus am I born. Make me speak soft, sweet words, make me behave coolly and comfortingly 
towards all, let me do deeds that shower happiness on all and form ideas in my mind which 


are beneficial to all. May this day be worth while by Thy Service"---pray like this, sitting on your 
bed, before you start the day's schedule. Remember that pledge throughout the day. When you 
retire at night, sit up and examine quickly all the experiences of the day; see whether you have 
caused pain or displeasure to any one by any word or deed. Then pray, "I am now dying and 
falling in to your lap. Pardon me for any lapse; take me under your loving shelter." After all, 
sleep is a short death and death a long sleep. 


Train yourself to waken when Brahma-muhuurtham begins---that is to say, at 3.00 a.m. You may 
require an alarm clock at first for the job; but soon, the urge for Dhyaana will rouse you. Do not 
take a bath before you sit for Dhyaana, for the ritual of the bath will arouse the senses and you 
will be too full of pulls in different directions for the process of Dhyaana to succeed. Regularity, 
sincerity, steadiness--these will reward you with success. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 22-1-1967 


When the mind of man is unattached to the ups and downs of life, 
but is able to maintain equanimity under all circumstances, then 
even physical health can be assured. The mental firmament must 
be like the sky, which bears no mark of the passage through it of 
birds or planes or clouds. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


5. Not Loka but Lokesha 


YOU know that today is a sacred festival at Prashaanthi Nilayam and thousands have gathered 
here to share in it. Most of them have come with a load of sorrow which they 


hope to unburden here; many are praying for the relief of their physical or mental ills; some are 
broken by the weight of misery. Most have some pain or other, some loss or other, for which 
they crave relief. My task is to appease their grief. "Vaidhyo Naaraayano Harih"---"Naaraayana 
is the Doctor that destroys illness." That is what the Vedhas declare. So, I shall do that work. 


The doctor does the main surgical operation, or the main task of diagnosis and prescription. The 
rest is done by the nurses, isn't it? They attend to the patients kindly and considerately, to their 
food, their temperature, their movements---and with loving care, they help recovery. It is that 
type of service that I am allotting to you today. If you fail in your duties to these patients if you 
do not follow the doctor's instructions strictly and attend to their needs as directed, you will be 
complicating matters and causing great harm. 


"Na karmanaa na prajayaa dhanena thyaagena eke amruthathvamaanasuh"---"Immortality can 
be attained, not by ritual deeds, nor by birth, nor by wealth, but only by sacrifice and 
renunciation". This is the declaration of the Vedhas. The seva (service) into which you are 
initiated is the first step in the training for this sacrifice. Seva is the highest Saadhana for, God 
Himself takes human form and comes down to serve mankind and lead it to the ideals it has 
ignored. Therefore consider how delighted God will be when man serves man! 


Worldly thirst makes man bestial, thirst for Krishna 


Many people come to Prashaanthi Nilayam all alone, though they are old or ill; for, they are too 
poor to afford a companion or too orphaned to have one. You have to be on the look-out for 
such, and seek chances to help them. Do not wait until they faint or fall. Seat them in the shade 
or inside the sheds and relieve their exhaustion or thirst, as best and as quickly as you can. 
Persuade the younger and healthier persons to vacate their seats inside the sheds for the sake of 
these aged and sick persons. And, do not yourself occupy the front rows. 


The badge does not confer any privilege on you; it only puts responsibilities on you. In your 
anxiety to see me from close quarters, do not push your way into the front. But, wherever you 
are, even in the farthest corner, if you are cheerfully discharging the duty entrusted to you, I shall 
be with you, by your side; do not doubt this. You are wearing my picture on the badge; but I am 
inside your heart, all the time. 


The weather is pretty hot nowadays and so, you have one more item of service, the supply of 
drinking water to the thirsty. The body suffers from thirst for water; that is called, Thrishna; the 
spirit has a keener thirst, Krishna. Worldly thirst is disastrous; it makes man bestial in his efforts 
to satisfy the craving. If the earth was a little smaller, man might have swallowed it whole! 
Luckily it is a little too big. 


Grace of the Guru will save the devotee 


But, you are not concerned with the world; you are now concerned with the Lord of the world--- 
not the Loka but the Lokesha. Obey the command of the Lord, that is enough. You need not 
worry that you have no time, for Japa or Dhaayana, or Puuja or Prayer. Shankara, the great 


Aachaarya, had four chief pupils Thotaka, Hasthaamalaka, Sureshwara and Padhmapaadha. Of 


these, Padhmapaadha was intent only on service to the Gum; he could not pay attention to the 
lessons. The others used to sneer at him for his backwardness in studies. But his deep reverence 
for the Guru made up for it. One day, he washed the clothes of his Guru and dried them on a rock 
in the middle of the river; but, even as he was folding them, the river rose fast in a swirling flood; 
and he had scarce a foothold on the top of the rock. It was getting late; the Guru would need the 
washed clothes soon; so Padhmapaadha resolved to walk across, over the raging waters. He 
knew that the blessing of his Guru would save him. And it did. Wherever his foot was planted, a 
sturdy lotus bloomed and bore it on its petals. That is why he came to be called, Lotus-footed, 
Padhmapaadha! The Grace of the Guru enabled him to master all knowledge and shine as a 
brilliant exponent of the ancient wisdom. 


Life is short, it is liable to be cut short any moment. The body may fall and release you, without 
notice. So while you can, you must dedicate the heart to Him who gave it to you. Your heart is 
your witness; question it whether you have obeyed the directions of the Lord. A thousand 
persons may swear that you have not, but if your conscience affirms that you have, you need not 
fear. 


Serve God by serving the Godly 


There was a clever miser, who argued that God need not be given any offerings, for, with Amrith 
(Nectar) in His stomach He would have no hunger or thirst. He argued that it would be 
sacrilegious to pour water on His Idol, because the Gangaa emerges from His feet and it will be 
highly improper to apply on the head what has originated from the feet. So too, he dismissed the 
idea of offering the lotus flower, since, it bloomed from His Navel. All these are but excuses, by 
which conscience cannot be deceived. Do not people make a crown for the idol from gold that 
once formed an anklet for its foot? Reverence can transform and make things pure and holy. Do 
not manufacture excuses for avoiding service to God. Serve God, by serving the Godly. God 
appreciates that service most. 


The greatest consequence of Seva is the elimination of egotism---Ahamkaara. Suurdas prayed 
that he be made the servant of the servant of the Lord, so that no trace of ego be left in him. This 
is the reason why the pupil who lived with the Guru, had to go with a bowl to beg his food. 
Suurdas said, "The Lord does not need my service; he has everything. He has many devotees 
more efficient than I. But these, His devotees, they are in distress; they need care; I shall serve 
them and uplift myself." 


You are now serving the really needy. When a marriage is celebrated in your home, you compel 
people who are already full, to eat more and more, resulting in waste. While the well-fed are 
over-fed against their wish, the hungry who clamour at the door for a morsel are driven away 
with a hail of harsh words. Suurdas told Krishna, "You are eternally content, eternally full, free. 
Why should I serve you? I shall serve those who are in need of service." 


See the Universal in all. See all as similar waves, sustained by the same sea. Develop that 
kinship, that love, that sympathy. Serve others, not with the feeling that they are others, but with 
the attitude of worship that you reserve for God. One single act of service offered to the God 
whom you visualise in another is worth all the years of yearning for God. 


Your duty is to serve, not search for faults 


You may ask, "Swaami! When you find a person behaving wrongly, viciously, how can we love 
him? How can we revere him, as you want us to?" In such a situation consider one thing: Who is 


it who committed that wrong? What is it that prompted the act? Who did the deed? The body did 
it. What prompted the body? The mind. Why was he forced to do it? Through the influence of his 
karma, the cumulative effect of his activities and attitudes through many lives in the past. The 
Aathma in him is unattached, to any deed or motive. That Aathma is Divine; love that, revere 
that. That is My answer. 


To put in simpler terms: you observe a big portrait of Swaami over the entrance of a house, as 
you walk along the road. You find that it is the house of a person, who is your relentless foe! 
But, do you revere the portrait any the less, because the owner of the house does not deserve 
your love? Of course, you love the portrait, you revere it, wherever it is. Is it not? So too, revere 
the Aathma in every one; it is the God residing in each. Why should you pay attention to his 
wrongs and vices? Your duty is to serve, not search for faults. Serve with all your heart, serve 
with pure undefiled love. Under My unseen supervision and guidance you have to serve them 
and relieve their pains and troubles. 


Harsh behaviour will not bring any benefit 


There is a popular tune in Thelugu, "Brindhaavan is everyone's; Govindha belongs to all." 
Similarly, Prashaanthi Nilayam belongs to everyone, Baaba belongs to all. Just as in a hospital, 
all patients have the right to be treated and to get the drugs, here too, everyone who comes has to 
be honoured and served. 


Talk sweet and soft, to those in pain and grief. When a person is suffering from fever, go near 
him and say pleasingly and consolingly, "What is the complaint? Where does it pain? What shall 
I bring for you? Shall I bring you some medicine, or shall I call the Doctor? Do not worry, we 
shall look after you." Then, those words so full of love will reduce the suffering. They will be 
overcome with gratitude. "O, what tenderness, what sympathy! Blessed are the parents who can 
call these their children," they will say within themselves and they will bless you from the 
bottom of their hearts. "Even at home, people do not treat us so lovingly," they will confess. That 
is the fruit you must strive for. 


If some one who is thirsty asks for water, do not fly into a rage and tell him, "I am not here to 
supply water whenever you call for it; wait for sometime. Swaami is about to come into the 
Auditorium. I will not move now, to stop your clamour." Darshan of Swaami secured by such 
harsh behaviour will not bring you any benefit. 


Be vigilant to utilise all chances of seva which will give Aanandha to Swaami. Observe soft 
speech, maintain cleanliness and be of use to those in need of service. See that you set an 
example to others. Do not rush to silence persons talking loudly; go near them, and politely 
explain to them why silence is insisted upon here; tell them it is the first step in saadhana, that 
they have to learn how to maintain Prashaanthi, not only here, but wherever they are; that the 
tongue has no task here, it is all for the eye and ear; people will certainly follow your directions 
if they know the why and where for. Tell them that by loud talk, they are undermining their own 
peace; and disturbing others. Do not cause more noise than is necessary. When you are about to 
spread your bed, do not throw the roll on the floor with a loud thud. 


Be guided by the discipline of the Nilayam 


I must tell the men volunteers this, with some emphasis. You tend to wander outside the Nilayam 
area, and squat in the shops and eating houses, talking to all and sundry on trivial matters. You 
have spent much money to come here and you have come with much hope of being at peace 


here; but, once you go out into the bazaar, all the old urges drag you into the whirlpool of 
worldly things. If it is comfort you need, you could have stayed at home. If it is Grace, Peace, 
Knowledge of the Path, Sathsang (holy company), that you need, then keep within and be guided 
by the discipline of the Nilayam. 


Realise the great good fortune that you have in being chosen by Me for this service, when 
thousands outside are eager for just one word from Me. The badge is an indication of the Sai 
within you, it warns you that you are not a bundle of passions and emotions, you are not this 
body at all but the prathi-bimba (reflection) of God, who is the bimba (the object). The badge 
has also the OM, the Pranava, on it; honour it, meditate on its meaning, value it as an initiation. 
Press it on your eyes when you go to bed and when you wake up in the morning, pray, "O Lord, 
may all my acts be pure and holy." 


Only sympathy can win the Grace of the Lord 


All who have gathered here are your kinsmen, your brothers and sisters. Do not worry about your 
daily schedule of japa or dhyaana or puuja, which you may have to forgo; or even your daily 
routine of food, rest and sleep which will be upset. You will not be missing the chance of 
heaven, if you miss the Shivaraathri vows of vigil and fast. Shiva once demonstrated to 
Paarvathi that, of the many hundreds who bathed in the Ganga and carried the holy water to the 
Vishweshwara Temple at Kaashi, no one had an iota of sympathy towards a dying beggar on the 
street, whose wife was calling out for a cup of water to slake the thirst of her husband. A thief 
had the sympathy; he gave the water and won the grace of the Lord; not the other pilgrims, who, 
keen on rituals, bathed the idol of Vishweshwara with the waters of Ganga mumbling Vedhic 
hymns on that Shivaraathri day! 


Tomorrow morning, we will have the Flag Hoisting Function. In the evening, the 
Lingodhbhavam (emergence of Linga) takes place. Thousands have come and thousands more 
will gather. Serve them gladly and efficiently; serve them so that they will have happy memories 
of Prashaanthi Nilayam and the volunteers. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 8-3-1967 


Practising meditation in silence and solitude, one can in due 
course establish silence and solitude in the heart, even in the 
busiest thoroughfares. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


6. Angam and Lingam 


THE Glory of India reaches the ends of the world. She is the embodiment of Spiritual Victory. 
She has given birth to indomitable heroes who have assailed the inner foes and adventured far 
into the region of the Reality. These have laid down for the guidance of mankind various 
disciplines which will prepare them for similar triumphs. Among these, the ceremonial 
observance of holy days, dedicated to intense meditation on the aspects of Godhead, is highly 
important. One can understand the ridicule which Westerners, in their ignorance, pour on these 
observance; but, it is pathetic to find Indians also among the traducers! They too have become 
blind to the meaning and significance of their heritage. They have not tasted the fruits of the 
discipline, as they have not practised it. How then can value be attached to their judgement? 


The state of the Indian nation can be summarised in the proverb: "Father is happy with his 
second wife; children miserable with their step-mother." The technological civilisation of the 
West, the culture that places the standard of living in a more honourable place than the means by 
which that standard is attained, the culture that flies to the moon but is afraid to peep into the 
mind, has become the favourite wife; the children who are to be fed on mother's milk of 
Sanaathana Dharma (the eternal religion), are miserable, for they have no training to secure it. 
Born to a rich heritage, the children are growing up destitute and helpless. Each one is the 
repository of Divine Might, of the Imperishable Aathma. Contacting this Reality is the prime 
purpose of life. But, this is neglected; precious days are spent in inferior pursuits. 


Man desires peace and cultivates worry 


Raamakrishna Paramahamsa bewailed every night that one more day had gone by without His 
being able, by His prayers, to visualise the Mother as a living Mother. That is the yearning that 
man must cultivate, not the competitive greed for sensory pleasures that are false and fleeting. 
Man must engage himself in such tasks as will confer on him peace and lasting joy. Man must 
examine for himself the merits of various activities, and choose only such as will benefit him. He 
desires peace and cultivates worry and anxiety. Planting a lime tree, he hopes to get mangoes 
therefrom. This is sheer ignorance or wilful blindness, or the result of misguidance. 


To make coal white, it is foolish to wash it in milk; the milk too gets black. You have to heat it 
red-hot, and continue the process until it is transformed into white ash. The ash remains ash for 
ever. Similarly, the Thaamasik (dull-witted and ignorant) mind (black) has to be transmuted into 
the Raajasik stage (red or active and passionate) and then, to the Saathwik stage (white or calm 
and pious), by the process of spiritual discipline (heating). The blackness and the redness are 
produced by the qualities of greed and lust. Regular treatment with the drug of self-control 
(nigraha) will cure you of these. These holy days have been prescribed for inaugurating the 
treatment. The Shaasthras extol the drug and lay down the method of administration. The lives 
of Saints encourage you to seek it and save yourself by it. Through these, man can ascend from 
the animal to the human level and from the human to the Divine. Yes. You too can become 
Divine; I have nothing that you too do not possess. It is latent in you, it is patent and potent here; 
that is the only difference! 


Sanctity of Shivaraathri and emergence of Linga 


Life is a short and fast-flowing chance; you will have to put every minute to the best use: that is, 
the discovery of your own Reality, which gives you the highest joy. Do not spend time inquiring 
about the whence and wherefore of others. Inquire about yourselves. When an election comes 


along, you wander from door to door, and fall at the feet of all and sundry, to earn their votes. 
Instead of demeaning yourselves in this manner, if you fall at the Feet of God, and become 
worthy of His Grace, people themselves will press you to stand for election and fill the ballot 
boxes with votes for you. For this you must have faith, faith in God and Grace. Now, most 
people have no faith; what is worse, they laugh at those who have, they scorn those who create 
and promote that faith. 


What is the sanctity of Shivaraathri? You answer, "Linga emerges from Swaami's Udhara 
(abdomen)." In fact, the Linga is in every one of you. In the Angam (body) there is Jangam; (in 
the body composed of limbs, there is always the movement of the mind towards the external 
objects); in Jangam, there is Sangam (through this movement, there arises attachment); in 
Sangam there is Lingam (through attachment and consequent suffering, the individual learns the 
need for and the efficacy of the Linga, or God, who is His innermost core). Witness the Aathma 
Linga (Spirit of the Soul) that emerges; derive bliss therefrom. But, make yourself worthy for 
deriving it. 


Shivaraathri night should be spent in vigil 


For example, let me tell you why this day is considered holy. Today is the fourteenth day of the 
dark half of the month, when the moon is all but invisible; just a minute fraction remains visible 
to man. The moon is the presiding deity of the mind. The mind is the source of all the entangling 
desires and emotions. The mind is, therefore, almost powerless this day; if only this night is 
spent in vigil and in the presence of the Divine, it can be fully conquered and man can realise his 
freedom. So, every month, the fourteenth day of the dark half of the month is prescribed for more 
intense saadhana and once a year, this Mahaashivaraathri, the Great Night of Shiva, is laid 
down for the Great Consummation. 


Vigilance this night is to be secured by saadhana, that is, by means of bhajana, or the reading of 
sacred texts or listening to the reading of such texts; not by attending film-shows, or gambling, or 
playing cards. Be engaged in seeing good, listening to good, speaking good, thinking good, 
doing good; that is the programme for the vigil tonight. Make it also the programme for your 
entire life. 


A father sent his son to the market with a sum of money to bring home some fruits. While 
bringing them home, the boy saw a few beggars on the road and heard their wails; he realised 
that they were very hungry and that they needed the fruits more urgently. So he gave the fruits to 
them and came home empty-handed. When the father chided him, the son replied, "I have 
brought you invisible fruits that are sweeter and more lasting." Yes; the fruits of charity, 
rendered to the deserving, are really sweeter and lasting. Seek all chances of doing such good 
acts. 


Now, I shall unfurl the Prashaanthi Flag. No good will come if I merely unfurl it on this 
building. Prashaanthi or the Highest Peace can be won only when each one of you unfurls it in 
your heart. Ruminate on what I have said when you reach home and digest it and let it add to 
your strength and forbearance. Dedicate all your deeds, words and thoughts to Sarveshwara, the 
Supreme Sovereign. The Emergence of the Linga (the ellipsoid-shaped representation of the 
formless Divinity) will happen today. Do not, in your anxiety to secure sitting space, sit in the 
sun from 3 p.m. itself. Do not disregard the rules of health. Do not exhaust yourself. So long as 
you are here, do not waste a single moment in worthless talk. Now, I shall go up to the terrace 
and unfurl the Flag. Do not fall upon each other and struggle to pick the flowers showered from 


above. Be restrained, be orderly. Afterwards, move on to the Auditorium, where Abhishekam 
(ritual bathing) will take 


place. Witness everything and derive full joy. 
Prashaanthi Nilayam, 9-3-1967 


Resolve that relying on His Grace, you shall be free from illness 
from this moment. Transfer the faith that you have in drugs to 
God; put your trust, not in medicine, but in Maadhava. Resort to 
prayer, to saadhana, japam and dhyaanam. They are the vitamins 
you need; they will restore you. No tablet is as efficacious as 
Raamnaam. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


7. No mirror, no image 


WHEN the word 'Lamp' is uttered, darkness does not vanish; when a patient is told of the 
properties of a drug, his illness is not cured by attentive listening; when a man suffering the 
agonies of penury is told of the various ways in which funds can help him to overcome it, he 
does not feel a bit relieved; a hungry man is hungry, even after hearing a tasty description of a 
magnificent banquet. If Sanaathana Dharma (the eternal religion) is extolled to the skies, as the 
cure for all the individual, social and national discontent prevalent among mankind, the 
discontent will not decrease a bit. You must extol it with faith; extol it out of the depth of your 
experience. You have to experience it and stand witness to its validity; you have to attain the 
state of perfect and lasting joy. Instead, you have ignored the cure and thus heightened the 
disease. 


Of course, attempts are being made without remission to overcome grief and acquire joy; but 
success is eluding; and when obtained, it is illusory. Man does not reason within himself about 
the authenticity of his experience. Constant self-criticism is necessary to avoid pitfalls and 
entering devious by-lanes. This day being a holy day, you should spend every minute in this 
intense search. That is why I am telling you about these fundamental issues. For what end is all 
this effort in life? You spend great effort in inviting your kith and kin, in decorating home, in 
preparing a feast, in providing music and dance, all for the marriage of the bride and the groom 
so that they may live together happily ever afterwards, isn't it? So too, all the earning and 
spending, all the yearning and sighing, all the reading and reciting, are for the individual to be 
wedded to the Universal, from which it has broken away, so that it may have bliss for ever. 


God can be won only by tough discipline 


The Universal can be cognised in the wink of an eye; the Bliss is available within a flash; but, 
you have to know the technique. You may have fresh vegetables, fine rice, excellent dhaal 
(lentil), clean tamarind--all the requisites for preparing a good lunch; but, if you have no 
knowledge of the art of cooking, of what avail is all this? You must learn, strive," struggle, and 
then, success will be yours. Start the process, take the first step; listen with attention, ruminate 
over what has been heard and try to put into practise a thing or two of what has been told. 


Nowadays you can bribe your way to success in every sphere. But God cannot be won by tricks 
or through short cuts. He can be won only by the hard way of straggle, detachment and tough 
discipline. Yearn desperately for Him, cling steadfastly to Him, fill your mind with His Form, 
His Majesty, His Glory and His Grace. Man is innately Divine; the Divine comes automatically 
into his consciousness. But the curtain of maaya (illusion) prevents that thrilling contact, that 
illumining revelation. This maaya is also a Divine Artifice, it is a vehicle or Upaadhi of the 
Lord. 


There is a story that once the Lord got angry with maaya and wanted ‘her' to disappear, for 
people are being led astray by her wiles. Maaya said, it seems, "I am the veil that you wear; Iam 
the fog that has arisen out of your own will; I am as widespread as You are; I am wherever You 
are; give me a place where You are not; I shall take refuge there." Each one of you can tear the 
veil by attaining the knowledge of the Reality of God; or, you can plead by prayer to the Lord 
Himself to lift it a little so that you may have a vision of His Reality. 


Learn and practise Vibhaaga Yoga 


Move about in the world like an actor, but be conscious all the time that you are on the way 
home, to be with the Lord from whom you have come. Whenever the feeling that the drama is 
real enters the mind, deny it firmly. Do not identify yourself with the role that you play. Such 
identification will retard your progress. 


You must learn and practise what is called Vibhaaga-yoga in the Geetha. What does Vibhaaga 
mean as in the Geetha expression Kshehtra-Kshethrajna-Vibhaaga-Yoga? Vibhaaga means 
division, differentiation, discrimination, separation of one thing from another. Understand the 
distinction between the Kshethra (the body, the field) and the Kshethrajna (the Knower in this 
body), He who is aware of all that happens, who is witness, the Dehi (the embodied) who is 
above all the dualities of pleasure and pain, good and bad. 


The base metal of modem civilisation has got mixed up with the gold of Sanaathana Dharma, 
and so the Vibhaaga (separation) has to be done in order to get the pure gold. You acclaim the 
feat when some one is shot up into space and starts revolving round the earth or racing to the 
moon. You do not realise that men on earth are being starved of resources by this costly 
adventure and that it is at the same time being tainted by hate and pride. One single rocket costs 
as much as the total budget of all the universities of India for twenty years! The net result of all 
this 'progress' is just this: mankind is living precariously on the brink of a holocaust; it is terror- 
stricken; man startles at the echo of his own steps! 


Be eager to come to the rescue of others 


Man feels that he is the master of the Universe and that the Universe is existing only under his 
sufferance. How then can he have peace? This conceit will bring about his fall; man must be. 
humble and realise that he knows so little; even about himself. Without the knowledge of his 
own self, What is all the lumber now filling his brain worth? Make yourself humble, pure, useful 
for others. That way lies peace and joy. 


Today is Shivaraathri. Take the ideal of Shiva. When the devastating Haalaahala poison 
emerged from the ocean, life on earth was threatened with immediate and total destruction. Shiva 
offered to drink the poison and save the world. His throat is blue ever since, for the poison has 
pervaded the area. Be eager to serve, to help, to come to the rescue of others. For this, one must 
cultivate Sahana (Fortitude, Equanimity). Otherwise, life will be as miserable as resting in the 
thick shade of a tree infested with red ants! If impatience, anger, hatred, and pride overcome a 
person, of what avail are other accomplishments? In the firmament of the heart, the Names of 
God must shine as stars and the confidence arising out of the knowledge of Aathma must shine 
like the Moon when it is full and bright. 


This is critical time for the people of India, when the self-confidence arising from self- 
knowledge is most necessary. Both men and women have to earn this knowledge and treasure it. 
Men should give up the attitude of putting down women. They are not 'servants' to be lorded 
over; they too have self-respect and individuality. In fact, women have devotion, sympathy, the 
spirit of sacrifice, fortitude and other virtues in greater measure than men. But yet, the feeling 
that if their advice is taken, it is somehow demeaning, is prevalent among men. This must be 
given up. Pay respect to spiritual excellence and intellectual discrimination, wherever it is 
evident. 


Yearn to reach the stage of perfect Bliss 


The highest awareness to which all spiritual effort leads is: "Brahma sathyam, Jagan mithya"--- 
"Brahman is real, the world is mythical." Every atom and cell is a bundle of energy, expressing 
the Divine will. Matter and energy are not really separate. It is all one Will concretising, 
pervading, prompting and continuing. To experience the world as such, one must transcend all 
dual categories and reach the unique, unitary base, identifying It and establishing oneself in It. 
When the eye is filled with Jnaana (Vision of God), the world will be seen as Brahman (the 
Eternal Absolute). Then the world and the entire complex of being and becoming will assume 
one colour, the Brahman colour, and you will have perfect equanimity, unaffected by any 
modification. No mirror, no image! There is only the Person, the Bimba, alone. Yearn to reach 
that stage of perfect unshaken Bliss. 


This stage can be known and appreciated only when you strive to be in the company of 
Saadhakas (spiritual aspirants) and Saints. When a sandalwood tree is felled by an axe, the axe 
edge too smells of sandal! That is the nature of the good: they bless even those who harm or 
malign them. Do not pay attention to the cynical laughter and cruel criticisms of the wordly- 
minded. When a kinsman lands at your door, if you rise to welcome him and speak words of 
welcome, he will enter and stay; but if you do not cast a look of recognition at him, he will be so 
hurt that he will turn back and go. So too, do not heed the comments of the foolish. They will 
then revert to those who indulged in them. 


I am also the target of such comments! People do not understand the ways of God. How can they 
know why a particular event takes place at a particular time in a particular manner? He alone can 
know. But, people try to sit in judgement and talk ill, when for example, some one dies of illness 
at this place! How can any one escape death? Even Avathaars (Divine Incarnations) cast off the 
physical form when the task for which they have come is over. It is the height of foolishness to 
lose faith in God when some one you cared for dies. The sentence that he earned is over and he is 
released. No one is born and allowed to live for the sake of another. Do not therefore allow any 
circumstance to affect your faith in God, who is your strength and solace. 


So, I advise you to utilise every moment of your lives in the most beneficial manner; to serve 
your fellowmen to the best of your capacity; to cultivate love towards all mankind; to give up 
hate and malice. Believe that your God, the Form that you revere, is in everyone and sanctify 
every act as worship of that Form. The Bhajan will continue throughout the night; share in it and 
fill your mind with the thoughts of the Glory of God, the Glory that you yourselves are. 


Mahaa Shivaraathri, Prashaanthi Nilayam, 9-3-1967 


8. The dying lament the dead 


KAAMA (desire) is the cause of birth; Kaala (Time) is the cause of death; Raama (God) is the 
guardian of life. On account of desire, birth takes place. By Time, which flows unceasingly on, 
respecting none, the thread of life is cut. Through the constant chanting of the Name of God, life 
is made worthwhile. Life is a battle; the battle is fought until victory. The goal of victory is the 
'Crown' of Aathma, the 'Sovereignty' of the Realm of Liberation. That is attained and won by the 
process laid down in Vedhaantha. 


Vedhaantha is the consummation or the finale of the Vedhas. Milk when curdled is rendered 
separable into butter and whey, and butter when melted and clarified becomes ghee; ghee is the 
finale, the anta (the final stage) of milk. So too, man's final, irrevocable transmutation is 
Liberation, Moksha. When you prepare yourself for victory in this battle with your inner foes and 
the senses, the Lord gives you the reinforcements you need, for you are proceeding to Him and 
He takes a hundred paces towards you for every ten you take towards Him! 


Once Raamadaas wailed, "O Lord! You are Mighty, All-powerful, All- knowing; I am alone, 
helpless, orphaned and poor." Then the Lord interrupted the self-condemnation and said, "No, 
how can you name yourself poor, help- less and orphaned? I am with you, in you, in showering 
My Grace. The only Orphan in the Universe is Myself; for, I have no guardian, no means of 
support, nobody to fall back upon. I am the A-naatha (orphan); all else are Sa-naatha (with 
Lord), for Iam their. Naatha (Lord)." 


Carry the atmosphere of the Nilayam to your own home 


So, do not call yourself as a Dheena (weak person); how can you be a dheena when you are 
endowed with dhhee? (Dhhee indicates Intelligence, Discrimination). With this dhhee as 
support, start your saadhana, without wasting precious time in wails. That is the highest duty 
you owe to yourselves. The saadhana can be to realise God as Formless (Nirguna) or with Form 
(Saguna). When one walks, the right foot and left foot are both necessary, you cannot hop long, 
on one foot! The Saguna Saadhana and the Nirguna Saadhana are as the two feet. When the 
pilgrimage is over and the shrine has to be entered, place 'the right foot forward! The right foot is 
towards the Nirguna Saadhana--the Formless aspect of God. 


You have spent the entire night in the recital of the Name; but do not be content; make it your 
daily sustenance. Do not imagine this to be like some places of pilgrimage you have visited, 
where you do not learn any lesson to be treasured in the heart. There you are in a picnic mood or 
in a tourist mood, seeing sights and collecting curios,. But here, you are silently immersed in the 
ecstasy of the Divine Presence. Carry this atmosphere to your own village and home and cleanse 
those places with holy thoughts and deeds. Make this Shivaraathri an Akhanda Shiva-raathri---a 
continuous festival of Shiva-contemplation---an inspiration for making life itself an unbroken 
adoration of Shiva. "Sarvadhaa Sarva kaaleshu sarvathra Had chinthanam," it is said--- 
"Everywhere, at all times, under all circumstances contemplation on Had (God)." 


Avoid even little misdemeanours 


When once Brahma asked the sage Naaradha what was the most amazing thing he noticed on 
earth, Naaradha replied, "The most amazing thing I saw was this: the dying are weeping over the 
dead." Those who are themselves nearing death every moment are weeping over those who have 
died, as if their weeping has any effect, either to revive the dead or prevent their own death! 


Brahma asked him to tell another, Naaradha said, "Another amazing thing is: Every one fears the 
consequence of paapa (sin), but goes on sinning nevertheless! Everyone craves for the 
consequence of punya (meritorious acts), but everyone is reluctant to do any meritorious act!" 


Polite conversation is sweet conversation, they say. But, mostly, this sweet talk is made up of 
falsehood and scandal. People often ask, how can we manage to live in society without a dash of 
falsehood? This is a wrong approach. Truth-speaking comes natural to man; it is falsehood that is 
an artificial skill. Be natural; be yourself; then you will not descend into falsehood. Avoid even 
little misdemeanours, for, by repetition, they warp character, and develop into vicious habits. 
When the wife is given ten rupees by the husband for shopping, she retains one rupee and spends 
only nine; and she hides the fact from her husband. Though the wife may argue that it is not 
improper, it is a wrong step. Examine your acts, thoughts and feelings every moment on the 
touchstone of Truth. 


When kaama is in the heart, Raama has no room 


With the doors of your hearts closed by the bolt of falsehood, how can you lay the blame on God 
if He does not illumine it with the rays of Grace? Falsehood is prompted by desire, by kaama; 
when kaama is in the heart, Raama (God) has no room. Let kaama and his evil brood of krodha, 
lobha, moha, madha and maatsarya (anger, greed, attachment, conceit and envy) slither out of 
the heart; then only can Raama instal Himself there. Without this cleansing operation, it is sheer 
waste of breath to shout Raam, Raam, Raam, swaying and shaking the body! What is the fun in 
shouting 'Victory', 'Victory' when the enemy is inside the fort, and you are too broken to eject 
him? 


Sow in the field of your heart the seeds of good thoughts, charged with humility; irrigate it with 
the waters of Love; protect the growing crop with the pesticide called Courage; feed the crop 
with the fertiliser. Concentration; then, the ‘bhakthi' (devotional) plants will yield the harvest of 
jnaana, the eternal wisdom, that You are He, and when that revelation comes, you become He, 
for, you were always He, though you did not know it so far. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 10-3-1967 


In spiritual matters, faith is the very essence. Doubt shakes the 
foundations of saadhana and is therefore, to be avoided. Have 
faith in the wisdom of the ancients; do not pitch you tiny little 
brain against the intuitions of the saints and their discoveries. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


9. From every throat, his melody 


THIS land of Bhaarath is indeed a holy country. Here the sages have sought to discover the 
means of peaceful life, of happy life in communities of men, of a type of life that will put an end 
to grief. They discovered and taught the Aathmavidhya (Science of the Self), the chief 
component of which is Prema or Love. God is .where Love is---Love expressed as sympathy, 
charity, reverence, affection, sacrifice. God is Love, Premamaya, Premaswaruupa, 
Premabhaaskara (full of love, Embodiment of Love, Sun of love), as He is described by those 
Who have realised Him. So, He can be attained only through Love. Bhakthi is defined as 
Parama-prema- swaruupa---of the nature of the highest love. It is not blind love; it need not be 
blind love. 


I always advocate deep inquiry to strengthen the foundations of faith. Inquiry will only reinforce 
the springs of Love. Can there be anything more lovable than God, who is Beauty, Strength, 
Glory, Fame, Splendour, Wisdom, in their fullest bloom? Love of God creates in man the love 
for all examples of His majesty, His mercy, His magnificence, His manifoldness. Raamakrishna 
saw in a flower His charm; He saw everywhere His grandeur; heard from every throat His 
melody, His Flute song. Even filth and wickedness are loved, for God allows them to be! 


Activity and devotion generate spiritual knowledge 


The true Indian must have this Love, inspiring and guiding him in all actions. Bhagavath-raththi 
(Love towards God) is the sine qua non of the child of Bhaarathamaatha. The very word means 
just that. The great men and women of this land did not waste their lives into the pursuit of 
earthly possessions, but cast them off as encumbrances hampering progress on the path to God. 
They abdicated thrones and kingdoms, renounced war, learnt philosophy on battlefields and 
trekked far and wide in search of spiritual guides. Like men who had forgotten their names, they 
asked the wise who they were, until they knew their identity. They did not ask all whom they 
met, as most men do, "Who are you?," but inquired from all the wise men they met, "Please tell 
me who J am." That is the way to acquire full content and peace. 


The I is the foundation on which you build your Divinity and the Mansion of Dharma 
(righteousness). This truth can be known through Karma and Upaasana (activity and dedication, 
deeds and devotion) which purify and clarify. Just as water and fire get transformed into steam, 
which moves a locomotive and drags heavy wagons along the rails, Karma and Upaasana 
generate Jnaanam (spiritual knowledge), which moves man's life smoothly along the rails of 
Peace and Joy. Karma and Upaasana create detachment; they teach the true sense of values; man 
learns that peace can be won only by withdrawing the mind from the objective world, not by 
allowing it to graze in the poisonous meadows of sensual pleasure. 


Saints had full faith in their destiny 


When you are depressed by what appears to be loss or calamity, engage yourselves in 
Naamasmarana, the recitation and recollection of the Names of the Lord; that will give you 
consolation, courage and true perspective. Remember the distress and calamity that the saints 
underwent with enthusiastic welcome and be calm during every storm. People laughed at them 
and called them mad; but they knew that they were in the Grace Hospital of God, not the mental 
hospital of man. They had full faith in their destiny and so they had full faith in God; they 
laughed when calamities tried to cow their eagerness, for they knew their latent strength of the 
Aathma within. 


Now the pupils of the Vedhashasthrapaathashaala (School of Vedhic Learning) at Prashaanthi 
Nilayam will enact a play on this stage before you. They have seldom acted before such vast 
multitudes. The drama they enact is saturated with Adhyaathmik (spiritual) teachings. It depicts 
the sovereignty of Bhakthi, Jnaana and Faith, in easy, simple and sweet song and dialogue. They 
will now reveal the inner significance of the devotion of Raadha, a devotion that has been the 
target of criticism bred by ignorance and perversity. The boys will also tell you many things 
about the spiritual endeavour that you have to make. If others of your own age say those things, 
you might be tempted to protest, but when the children lisp the lessons, certainly you will love to 
take them to heart. Accept the lessons that this drama is intended to convey, whatever be the 
defects in presentation and performance. Listen in silence and patience; watch with sympathy. 
The boys may get nervous if you show any neglect or want of attention. Take this as another sign 
of My Grace and sit through the play in reverential attention. 


Matunga, Bombay, 19-3-1967 


It is always preferable to approach God for the fulfilment of wants, 
rather than cringe before men, who themselves are but tools in the 
hands of God. In his own silent way, God will transform the mind 
and turn it towards saadhana and successful spiritual pilgrimage. 
He cannot allow his children to lose their way and suffer in the 
jungle. When you approach God and seek his help and guidance, 
you have taken the first step to save yourself. You are then led to 
accept His will as your own. Thus, you achieve, shaanthi. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


10. The key the sages own 


LIKE an elephant which was once the leader of the herd, which is caught and tamed for hauling 
timber in the self-same forest where once it was the monarch forgetful of its prowess and 
grandeur, Bhaarath has forgotten its supremacy and wealth of spiritual achievement; it is hauling 
material lumber and feeling supremely satisfied when it gets sustenance and bondage! Man 
should be like the tiger, which refuses to eat grass even in the last extremity of starvation. There 
are certain things that man must refuse to do, even at the worst provocation or the most enticing 
temptation. Then only can he deserve to be termed human. In this land where thyaaga (sacrifice) 
and seva (service) to others were proclaimed as the twin paths to fulfillment, the fell diseases of 
greed and selfishness have spread in recent years. This is a tragedy for the entire human 
community. 


I am emphasising this today, because I find that this vast gathering is mostly composed of 
students from schools and colleges. These diseases are affecting the youth of this land. The youth 
are the very foundation of the nation; they are the roots that uphold and feed the ideals of the 
nation. They must, therefore, grow in an atmosphere of reverence and humility, not in the hot- 
house of passion and faction. The elders must provide the atmosphere, in the homes, in the 
villages, in clubs, in civic bodies, in legislatures, in all walks of public life. Youths try to behave 
like their elders; so the elders must be good examples to them. 


Those who draft the syllabuses and curricula for the schools and colleges must be imbued with 
reverence for our national culture, which is really pure international culture. Then only can our 
students become true sons and daughters of India. This is the responsibility of the legislators and 
the rulers of whom there are some on this very platform. That is why I am telling them this. 


Our sages had the welfare of humanity at heart 


Now the students have started querying, quite against the culture of India, the very existence of 
God, the very need for morality and the very value of sacrifice and service. This is the combined 
effect of the home, the school, the society and the leadership. If this is overcome, the youth of 
this land can well raise up this land to grand heights in the coming years. 


A virtuous character is the lamp which illumines the path to peace and joy. This is the teaching 
of sages who had the welfare of humanity at heart and who bore the rigours of asceticism to 
discover the key. The teachings of these ancient seekers attracted the respect of men like Dhara 
Shukoh, the brother of Aurangzeb, as well as women like his sister, Zebunnissa Begum. Dhara 
had the Upanishadhstranslated into Persian; he adored them as the highest wisdom. 


Zebunissa was also an ardent student of the same culture. One day, when her maid was holding 
the mirror to her while combing her hair after her bath, it slipped and broke. She was morally 
afraid to be near her mistress and stood shivering in dread of her anger. But the Princess 
consoled her saying, "Why worry over the damage to the mirror? Even the body to which all 
these articles cater is liable to damage and destruction." Like a bird that sees a lump of flesh in 
the far distance, but does not notice the net spread over it to catch, man too sees but the charms 
of material objects; he does not notice the entanglements which they cause. 


Man tries to map the craters and canyons and the volcanoes on the moon, but ignores the craters 
within his own heart; how then can he acquire peace? Man undergoes enormous trouble to guard 
his viththam (wealth), but does not spread an iota of energy to guard his chiththam (inner 


consciousness). 
Aathma is the source and repository of everything 


You say, "Seeing is believing; I believe in God only if I see Him, but are all things seen or heard 
or touched or tasted as real as they seem? Is it the eye that sees? Your eye may be open and 
turned in that direction, but if your mind is wandering elsewhere, you will not notice anything at 
all. You see things only through the illumination of the Aathma; you love only because the 
Aathma is Love; you know because the Aathma is knowledge. You have shaanthi, for the 
Aathma is the source and repository of shaanthi. The subtle effect of manthras (mystic formulae) 
mentioned in the Vedhas cannot be seen or heard by the senses; they have to be experienced in 
and through the inner consciousness, the Anthah-karana. 


The sound of these manthras has the power of transforming the impulses and tendencies. The 
word manthra means "that which saves when turned over in the mind." Revolve the manthra 
ever in the mind; that will keep off wild talk, purposeless conversation, aimless gossip and 
scandal. Talk only when the talk is most essential and talk only as little as is necessary. Talk 
sweetly and without any reservations or circumvention. 


I want students to be convinced of the excellence of these teachings of the Vedhas and 
Shaasthras. 1 am glad efforts are being made by the Sathya Sai Seva Samithi to spread this 
knowledge among them. Things cannot be bettered by the grown-ups. Their attitudes have been 
shaped already. The youth have to develop fine qualities of head and heart. They must join and 
partake in spiritual groups and be useful to themselves and others. Revere your parents and be 
useful to themselves and others. Revere your parents and try to make them happy. That is the one 
item of worship which you can whole-heartedly take up, from this very day. When your parents 
are rendered miserable by your actions, how can God be pleased with you and listen to your 
prayers? 


Mahaaraashtra is the land of many saints who have spread Bhakthi through their teachings. It is 
the heart of Bhaarathavarsha on account of this. Try to deserve being the children of 
Maharaashtra by following their valuable teachings. 


Sardar Patel Stadium, Bombay, 21-3-1967 


11. The Mighty Mahaavaakya 


IN THESE days, when the black clouds of hatred are spreading from state to state and poisoning 
the relations between man and man, spiritual discipline and spiritual illumination alone can serve 
as a beacon light. People feel helpless before the flood of falsehood, injustice and violence. They 
can be saved only by the four-fold refuge of Sathya, Dharma, Shaanthi and Prema. They are 
infused in man by the religious scriptures and by the stories of the saints and sages in the 
Puraanas which depict their search after God. 


The enthusiasm which is aroused by the study of these books should not fade away, like the 
boiling over of milk on the stove. After a few minutes of bubbling over, the milk starts cooling 
off. When one reaches home, after listening to a discourse, the fervour derived from the message 
fades into nothingness and one slides back into the fateful routine. 


This is called Puraana-vairaagya--the gust of renunciation that one gets when he hears a 
religious discourse, which soon passes off into the realm of neglect. The Saadhaka (spiritual 
aspirant) must crave for deeper impression; the Mahaavaakyas (Vedhic Statements of Truth) he 
hears, the visual experiences he gains, have to be imprinted on the heart. 


There are no two entities but only One, Brahman 


All the manifold rules, regulations, limitations, directions, do's and don’ts, have just this aim: to 
merge the soul with the Oversoul---the Jeevaathma with the Paramaathma. The Shaasthras 
prescribe yama (various forms of abstention from evil-doing), niyama (disciplined observances), 
aasana (physical posture), praanaayaama (control of breath), prathyaahaara (withdrawal of the 
mind from sense objects), dhyaana (meditation) and samaadhi (super-conscious state of 
absorption in the Aathman), etc., as limbs of Yoga; besides japam (repetition of Lord's name or 
mystic formulae), shravanam (listening to God's glory), mananam (recapitulation of what was 
heard), nidhidhhyaasana (constant musing on God's glory), etc.---all with this one end in view--- 
of merging the Jeevaathma with Paramaathma. Spiritual saadhana is like a duel with a tiger, 
maaya; it is like playing with fire, maaya. By means of the hammer strokes of joy and grief, the 
iron piece is shaped into a hollow vessel, so that it may not sink in the sea of maayaa (world 
illusion). 


Mix honey and sea water; the concoction will be undrinkable. In the same way, do not mix the 
nectarine Grace of the Lord with the greed for sensual pleasures. Develop Prajnaana---the pure, 
unsullied vision of Reality; then you can visualise the One that is appearing as this Many. 
Prajnaanam Brahma, says the Vedha; "the constant integrated awareness is Brahma." It is that 
by which the intelligence integrates, that by which the senses co-operate in bringing about 
workable conclusions. 


The physical body and the Prajnaana are related through the senses and the intelligence. When 
man and God operate together, like the positive and the negative, Prajnaana, the current, is 
generated. It is this Prajnaanam that establishes in you the conviction, Aham Brahmaasmi, I am 
Brahman; not that there are two entities, Aham and Brahman, but, as in syrup, where water and 
sugar have merged, Aham has merged in Brahman and there is only one entity, Brahman. 


The Saama Vedha has the great statement, Thath thwam asi (That thou art), meaning "What 
which is beyond Ruupa and Naama (name and form) is you, who now pitiably differentiate 
yourself and feel distinct, by means of name and form, two transient changing insignia of 


individuality." Contemplation on these grand expressions of the Truth fills one with inexplicable 
joy. Not being aware of these and their sweetness, man misses the great opportunity. 


One must have discrimination, not mere ideas 


The Prashaanthi Vidwanmahaasabha is designed to bring this rich treasure to the door of every 
one in this world, for every one is entitled to it. Not only these; the Geetha, the Raamaayana, the 
Mahaabhaaratha, the Bhaagavatha---these too contain the message of God; they should also be 
taken to the doors of every man. He must be fed on it, so that he may grow in health and 
strength, courage and confidence; because this is something which once you get, you can never 
lose! Jnaana (Self-Knowledge). There is another thing which if you once lose, you can never get 
back; that is, maaya. There is a third thing, which you can never get, for it is You yourself; you 
can never lose also, for it is You yourself that is Brahman. 


Use your intelligence and you will arrive at the correct interpretation of the manifoldness of the 
Universe. Science is fast approaching the view that basically the Universe is One. Only, 
intelligence has to be rid of prejudice and cleverness. A sanyaasi (monk) had a bear which he 
fondled as a pet and took around with him in his wanderings. One day in the midst of the thick 
jungle, he commissioned the bear to keep watch over him and went to sleep. The bear saw a fly 
sitting on its master's nose; it tried to whisk it away; but it came back again and did not move 
away. Incensed as its audacity, the bear brought a big stone and threw it at the fly on the nose. 
Needless to say, that stone killed the master. One must have discrimination, not simply a fund of 
ideas. 


God is the Companion and Guide of all 


The speaker who is the President, referred to Mahaathmas and Divine personages, whose vision 
is of a universal order. But it is difficult for ordinary intelligence to grasp their meaning and 
mystery. Each of them has his task, his standard, his area and his method or bhaava. He said that 
Sathya Sai Baaba knows all that happens in all. That is because I am in every one---Ishwarah 
sarvabhoothaanaam---as the scriptures say. This current is in every bulb; only, some are of low 
wattage, some of high wattage. There is no fundamental difference between Jeevaathma and 
Paramaathma. The Upaadhis (vestures) or bulbs have differences in power, depending on the 
filament and its strength. The cow eats grass; the pig eats offal, the lion eats flesh. That is the 
speciality of the Upaadhi; how can there be any comparison or competition between these? 


A hathayogi had earned many strange skills and he found people gathering in large numbers 
around a person whom he could not gauge. That person had characteristics which no skill can 
bring about; Shamham, Sathyam and Prema (Equanimity, Truth and Love). If one's passions and 
emotions have come under the control of his higher nature, then the Lord will assume 
responsibility for his progress towards Him. Otherwise, he will have to wait. Do not moan that 
you have no Naatha (Guardian). God is the only A-naatha (Guardianless person). All the rest 
have Him as the Naatha. He is ever beside man, within him as Conscience, without him as 
Companion and Guide. 


Sardar Patel Stadium, Bombay, 24-3-1967 


This world is the jungle in which you roam; fear is the lion, which 
drives you up the tree of samsaara---worldly activities. Anxiety is 
the bear that terrifies you and dogs your steps in samsaara,' so, 


you slide down into attachments and binding deeds, through the 
twin roots of hope and despair. The two rats are day and night, 
which eat away the span of life. Meanwhile, you try to snatch a 
little joy from the sweet drops of egoism and 'mine-feeling.' 
Finding at last that the drops are trivial and out of reach, you 
shout in the agony of the renunciation, calling on the Guru; the 


Guru appears, whether from within or without, and saves you from 
fear and anxiety. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


12. The prop you need 


THERE are three entities in the Universe, with which man has to deal: Paramaathma, Prakrithi 
and Jeevaathma---God, Nature and Man. Of course, God is to be worshipped by man, to be 
realised by man through Nature (Prakrithi). Nature is the name for all the various items that 
impress upon man, the glory and the splendour of God. It is called maayaa too. Maayaa is the 
vesture of God which hides as well as reveals His Beauty and Majesty. Man must learn to use 
Nature not for his comfort or entanglement to the utter forgetfulness of the God behind the joy he 
derives, but for the better understanding of the intelligence that guides the Universe. How does a 
tree grow or a flower bloom? How does man learn about the stars and space, except by the 
inspiration of the joy and the intelligence which He who resides within endows? Approach 
Nature in a humble, prayerful mood; then your future will be safe. Raavana coveted Seetha, who 
represents Prakrithi (Nature), and stealthily brought her over; but that selfishness and greed led 
him into the deepest fall. If only he had coveted the God behind Nature, Raama, he could have 
earned eternal joy. 


All the sufferings of man today can be traced to this false sense of values. First things must come 
first. First, self; then, help. Nowadays, people start helping others on the spiritual path without 
traversing that path themselves. So both the guide and the led fall into the pit. Serve yourself 
first, that is to say, understand who you are, whither you are going, whence you came and why 
you journey. After having discovered the answers to these questions from the scriptures, the 
sages and one's own undisputed experience, man can dare lead others. 


Duality is ever the basis of sorrow and pain 


People also are not trained to recognise the true from the false, the temporary from the eternal, 
the right from the wrong, the socially beneficial from the socially harmful. They dismiss all old 
customs and manners, old texts and rites, as useless simply because they are old; they adopt new 
customs and fashions simply because they are new. Time is a good tester; things that have stood 
the criticism of centuries, the blows of many alien cultures, the attractions of strange fancies--- 
these must have an essential core of truth and validity. 


The mind has a way of being drawn away by passing fancy. That is why every chapter of the 
Geetha is titled a Yoga, beginning from Vishaadayoga and ending with Mok-shasanyaasayoga. 
This word yoga is used in order to emphasise the importance of Chiththa-vriththi-nirodha---the 
overcoming of the agitation of the mind. The waters of the maanasa-sarovara, the lake of the 
mind, are never calm; they are seldom level. The slightest shiver in the air affects the layer and 
creates a series of wavelets which takes a long time to spend itself out. The mind too is stirred by 
the objects of the outer world and the impressions they make on the inner senses; the mind is 
either disgusted or drawn towards the objects. This disturbs equanimity; duality is ever the basis 
of sorrow and pain. Sorrow is the temporary absence of joy; joy is the temporary disappearance 
of sorrow. Both are not everlasting, except when joy is won by spiritual means. 


The assurance that Geetha gives to humanity 


How can this stage of yoga be attained? The Geetha proposes to teach just this. Its first word is 
Dharma and its last word is mama (mine). It teaches every one who studies it mama dharma--- 
"my dharma," "my duty," "my responsibility to myself." And what is that? Yoga. How is this 
yoga to be attained? By surrendering to God, dedicating every word, thought and deed to God, 
by effacing one's will and accepting His Will and leaving all initiation of activity to His 


Prompting, all execution to His Direction and all consequences thereof to His Plan. "Give up all 
‘right’ and 'wrong' and surrender your will to Me. I shall save you from falling; I shall guard you 
against grief'---this is the assurance the Geetha gives, that is the prop you need. 


Surrender can be effected only after the perfection of detachment from sensual pleasures, 
accompanied by discrimination between the real and the unreal. The taints of "I" and "Mine" 
have to be removed by rigorous saadhana; chief among the disciplines being Naarnasmarana, 
because when you dwell on the names of the Lord, His Majesty, His Grace, His Potency, His 
Pervasiveness, these get fixed in the consciousness and one's own capacities and capabilities get 
eclipsed in the Divine. So, humility increases and surrender is possible quite easily. This is the 
very purpose of human existence, to see God and merge in His Glory. All other victories are 
futile. The Vedhas proclaim this to be the final goal of man. The Upanishadhs declare the path. 
The Geetha illumines it. The saints and sages proclaim its grandeur. Avathaars come when 
people stray from it and get lost in the wilderness and the wastes. 


Jamnagar, 27-3-1967 


Limit, control, regulate, set bounds and bunds; that is the way to 
succeed. If people let lose their thoughts, words and deeds, 
calamity will be the consequence. Shaasthra means that which 
‘lays down limits'; interest in the art of living is created by these 
rules. Rules of behaviour must be observed by politicians, rulers, 
subjects, monks, who are leaders of the community and heads of 
monasteries, scholars and others, for they are exemplars and 
guides and their responsibilities are greater. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


13. The world, a training ground 


"WHENEVER there is a languishing of Dharma or righteousness and an upheaval of 
unrighteousness, I create Myself, for it is part of primal resolution or Sankalpa to protect the 
spiritual structure of the Universe. I lay aside My formless essence and assume a name and a 
form suited to the purpose for which I come. Whenever evil threatens to vanquish good, I have to 
come and save it from decline." The Lord does not insist on all men following one path and 
accepting one discipline. There are many doors to His Mansion. The main entrance is, however, 
moha-kshaya (the overcoming of attachment). This is what Krishna exhorted Arjuna to achieve. 
Arjuna lost heart and allowed the bow to slip from his hand, because he was overwhelmed by a 
deluding type of attachment. 


Krishna had to demonstrate to him that the kinsmen whom he dreaded to kill, the teachers whom 
he wished to live, those whom he loved and hated, all were but instruments of His Will, puppets 
pulled by His Hand. This destroyed his attachment and he resumed his task, without any 
attachment to the consequences. 


That made him the recipient of the greatest lesson in history. This lesson is valuable for the theist 
as well as the atheist, for both have attachment to the consequences of their tasks, an attachment 
which will colour their eagerness and double the distress when disappointed. Moha-kshaya is 
necessary for both Aasthikaas (theists) and Naasthikaas (atheists), in order to secure lasting joy. 
Both do not take from here any minute portion of their acquisitions, both can earn the gratitude 
of men only by sacrifice and love. 


The individual is but a spark of the Universal 


Mohammed of Ghazni, who amassed vast heaps of treasure by his campaigns against India, died 
of fever. He directed his vazir to carry his corpse to the burial ground with both his palms 
uplifted for all to see that the emperor who had accumulated fabulous wealth was going to the 
other world with empty hands. "Let every one know how transient is the splendour derived from 
the worldly possessions," he said during his last moments. 


When the tree of life sends its roots into the Aathmic reality, the unchanging, eternal, universal, 
immanent entity of which the individual is but a spark, it will flourish grandly, yielding fragrant 
blossoms of loving service, sweet fruits giving nourishment and joy to all, the sweetness of 
virtue rendering every bite and chew delightful. 


This does not mean that you have to renounce hearth and home and flee to the forest. There is no 
guarantee that the hearth and home will not follow you into the silence and solitude of the forest; 
for, if your mind clings to worldly desires, you cannot escape them by simply putting some 
distance between you and them. You may be in the jungle, but your mind may wander in the 
market place. Similarly, you may be in the market place, but by Saadhana you can still secure a 
patch of peace in the heart in the midst of the busiest thoroughfare. 


The mind can build a Silent refuge or tie you up into complex knots. It binds; it loosens bonds. 
You can sail safe on the sea of Samsaar (worldly life), if you have no leaks in the boat; but 
through the leaks of Kaama Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Madha or Maatsarya (lust, anger, greed, 
delusion, pride and envy), the writers of Samsaar will enter the boat and it will sink, drowning 
you beyond redemption. Do not allow the water into the boat; stop all the leaks. Then, you need 
have no fear in Samsaar, you can benefit by all the chances it gives for training the senses, 


widening the affections, deepening the experiences, and strengthening the detachment. 
Let every moment of your life be bhajana 


You have to read the newspaper to know how mad and foolish the world is; how futile is 
heroism, how momentary the glory; and after perusing it for the information it conveys, you 
throw it aside; it is now a tasteless waste. So too, live but once; so live that you are born but 
once. Do not fall in love with the world so much that your false fascination brings you again and 
again into this delusive amalgam of joy and grief. Unless you stand back a little, away from 
entanglement with the world, knowing that it is all a play whose director is God, you are in 
danger of being too closely involved. Use the world as a training ground for sacrifice, service, 
expansion of the heart, cleansing of the emotions. That is the only value it has. 


When you sing Bhajans, dwell also on the meanings of the songs and the message of each Name 
and Form of God Raama---the name should evoke in you the Dharma He embodied and 
demonstrated. Raadha---the name should evoke in you supramental, super-worldly Love she had 
as the greatest of the Gopees; Shiva---the name should evoke the supreme sacrifice of the 
drinking of the Haalahaala poison for the good of the world; the cool Grace heightened by the 
cascade of the Ganga and the moonlight from the Crescent. Do not waste time purposelessly; let 
every moment be Bhajana. Know the purpose of Bhajana or Naamasmarana and devote yourself 
wholeheartedly to it; derive the maximum benefit from the years allotted to you. 


Bhavanagar, 28-3-1967 


Be always saturated with prema, do not use poisonous words 
against any one, for, words wound more fatally than even arrows. 
Speak soft and sweet; sympathise with suffering and loss and 
ignorance; try your best to apply the salve of soothing word and 
timely succour. Do not damage the faith of any one in virtue and 
divinity. Encourage others to have that faith by demonstrating in 
your own life that virtue is its own reward, that divinity is all- 
pervasive and all-powerful. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


14. Limbs of the Divine Body 


YOU are called Sevaks (Servant), because you are engaged in Seva (Service). What exactly is 
Seva? Is it the way in which Bhakthi (devotion) manifests itself, a consequence of devotion? Or 
is it the cause of Bhakthi, one of the methods by which Bhakthi is expressed and developed? It is 
neither. It is not the sine qua non of Bhakthi, nor is it the result. It is the very essence of Bhakthi, 
the very breath of a Bhaktha (devotee), his very nature. It springs from the actual experience of 
the Bhaktha---an experience that convinces him that all beings are God's children, that all bodies 
are altars where God is installed, that all places are His Residences. 


Consider Seva as the best Saadhana (spiritual discipline). This is a great chance that you have 
secured. Your work among these large gatherings is more beneficial for your spiritual 
development than days of Japam or Dhyaanam. But do not believe that you can by means of 
Seva re-form or re-shape the world. You may or you may not. That does not matter. The real 
value of Seva, its most visible result, is that it reforms you, reshapes you. Do Seva as a 
Saadhana; then you will be humble and happy. Do not strut about that you are improving others; 
improve yourself. Make Seva an extension of your Japam and Dhyaanam---Japam and 
Dhyaanam put into practice, so to say. How can any one contemplate on a God who loves the 
poor and the grief-stricken and yet be cold when the poor and the stricken are around him? 


Serving all types of people is fine education 


I do not attach any value to the Japam within closed doors; the turning of rosaries by hands that 
know no help. I do not appreciate the dhyaanam that makes you deaf to the agony of pain. 
Dhyaanam should not harden the heart; it should soften it like butter, which melts at the slightest 
contact with heat. Seva is a great opportunity to see the God indwelling in all. Raama could have 
rescued Seetha unaided; but He chose to grant the seva to the vaanara (monkey) hordes, for they 
were the gods who had come to claim that chance. 


When you stand forth as a sevak---you will have experienced this these days---you meet all types 
of people; some who are very cooperative, some who are cantankerous, some who obstruct, 
some who argue, some who threaten, some who question your motive or authority. Contact with 
them is a fine bit of education. They toughen your character and train you to welcome with equal 
joy both praise and blame. Let me ask you, what is the one thing that you crave for most? Grace, 
is it not? Anugraha (favour), is it not? So long as your words and deeds are in conformity with 
Sathya and Dharma, so long as your words and deeds are sweetened by Prema and lightened by 
Shaanthi, you need have no worry; you have the Grace in ample measure. 


Helping people to get dharshan (audience), the dharshan they seek so ardently, is a laudable 
seva. You are volunteers here to help people crowding in large numbers to get dharshan not to 
prevent them from it. You have to see that they do not mill around, or rush forward or push the 
older and weaker persons. See that they sit in silent rows so that they can get full dharshan when 
I come. You have to help the infirm, the aged and the sick to enter unharmed and to take their 
seats. 


Do not rush yourself for dharshan, as I have seen some of you do, giving up the assignment 
allotted to you. Do not lose your temper; be sweet and soft, whatever the provocation. Have a 
smile ever playing on your face. Do not come between Me and those anxious to have my 
dharshan. They may in their resentment push you roughly aside; you have then no right to 
retaliate. You should reply with a smile, an apology, a polite explanation accompanied, with a 


Namasthe and folded hands. 
Milestones that mark the road to Sai 


I know that those of you who are posted for duty at the outer gates or in the garden, at the 
Bhajana Mantap (devotional singing hall) or the Shoe Counter, feel jealous of those who are in 
the inner apartments of the bungalow. Some of you go out on errands into the City and are absent 
from Bhajana, etc. I must tell you this. I have no special brand of Grace for those who are at My 
door, nor do I neglect the man a, the gate. In fact, I have no geographical "far" and "near"; My 
"far" and "near" are not calculated by physical nearness. You may be My side, yet, far; you may 
be far, far away, yet, very near and dear. However far you are, if you but stick to Sathya, 
Dharma, Shaanthi and Prema, you are close to Me and I am close to you. Those are the 
milestones that mark the road to Me. 


When your eyes see a ripe mango fruit on the tree, the tongue recollects the taste, the mind 
craves for it, the back stoops, the shoulders bend, the hand searches for a stone, the fingers clasp 
it, the arm throws it; and when the fruit falls, the hand picks it, the teeth bite into it, the throat lets 
it down into the stomach; there and thereafter it is converted into sustenance as a reward for the 
effort of all and sent as strength to eye and shoulder, hand and fingers, teeth and tongue. 
Similarly, when you all cooperate to give Me joy, the reward of Grace will be granted to all. 


Every Sai Sevak is a limb of the Sai Body 


You are all My Limbs, nourished by Me. You constitute the Sai Body. Sai will send you 
sustenance, wherever you are, whatever your function, provided you give Sai the things Sai 
considers sweet and desirable, like virtue, faith, discipline and humility. Be happy that you are a 
limb of the Sai Body. Do not complain that you are the foot and so have to tread the hard ground. 
Do not be proud that you are the head and so, up and above. It is the same blood-stream, the 
stream of Prema that circulates in both; the function of each is as valuable as the function of 
every other limb. The function of each limb is also unique, remember; so do not give room to 
despondency. Your part is something special, which only you can play. You cannot walk on your 
head; you cannot think with your feet. Whatever your position, win Grace by your virtue, that is 
the main gain. 


There is no wealth more satisfying than contentment. Eat your fill, you cannot eat more. If you 
are forced to eat more, it becomes a torture. There is a limit which you cannot overstep without 
injury to yourself. Find out your measure, your limits, your bounds, and act, do not develop 
jealousy towards others, whose measures are more, who have less limitations, less narrow 
bounds. Hold firm the step which you have reached in Saadhana; then transfer attention to the 
next. Have a clear vision of the goal. March on. 


Seva of Sai and Seva of Sai Bhakthas (devotees) is the same. When you serve the Sai Bhakthas, 
because they are Sai Bhakthas, you see the Sai in them, you seek to please the Sai in them, you 
revere the Sai in them. It is like serving a temple where Sai is installed, a room where a picture of 
Sai is adored. Throughout this period of Seva, you mink only of Sai; so this training helps you to 
purify your impulses, defy your thoughts, canalise your devotion and expand your Love. These 
are big steps in Saadhana, laudable victories. 


Concentration is needed for success in every operation 


When you are engaged in the simple operation of threading a needle, note how much 
concentration is needed for success. The fingers have to be steady, the eyes fixed and clear, the 


end of the thread screwed into a point, the needle's eye kept unshaken. The same care has to be 
taken when any other operation is to succeed. The Name of the Lord is the Bow, which you lift 
when you raise your voice in Bhajana. The mind is the arrow you fix; so fix your eye on 
Brahmam the target, and with single-pointed effort, shoot. Then the goal can be realised. 


I find many young persons here. I am glad that the Seva Samithi (service society) has given them 
this valuable experience. There are men volunteers and lady volunteers' so I must tell you 
another point on which I am very particular. You must consider others as your own brothers or 
sisters. I dislike flippant prattle, casual conversation and even face to face grouping of men and 
women, at all times, and more specially during spiritual gatherings or occasions. You must be 
models of straight and courteous behaviour. You must be good and appear good to every one. 
External beauty and charm are flimsy, they are ephemeral. Real beauty consists in virtue, self- 
control and selflessness. Sundaram (beauty) arises from Shivam (goodness)and Shivam from 
Sathyam (Truth). Be guided by this rule. 


Be saturated with devotion to God and man 


It has been suggested that a permanent body of volunteers be set up, who can be called upon 
whenever I visit this place, so that the meetings I address and the Bhajana Sessions where I am 
present may be conducted with minimum inconvenience to all. I suggest that the purpose should 
be much wider and more expansive. The Sathya Sai Dhal (volunteer corps) shall be the model 
for all other cities. The members must be saturated with devotion to God and man; they must 
have the skills which can make them better instruments. 


I want them to be sevaks all the time in all places, not merely when I visit the city or at the places 
where I address meetings. How can they withold their seva (service activity) on the pretext that I 
am not present in Bombay? Every seva done with sympathy and skill to any one in distress 
anywhere in this world is Sathya Sai Seva. 


If a Sathya Sai Seva Dal man or woman finds a person swooning on the road, or suffering pain 
or agony when going towards college or office, it is the duty of the finder to render all help 
possible to relieve the suffering. Do not ignore it and walk on. The Dal must be eager to serve 
and trained to serve, for service from those who take My Name must be intelligent and sincere. 


A sevak must be neither elated nor dejected; he must adhere to the middle path. When Raama 
asked Hanumaan to proceed towards the Southern region and described the dangers of the route, 
he was not dejected; when He gave him the ring to be handed over to Seetha, he was not elated 
that he had been chosen for the supreme task and given the glorious chance. He just obeyed. 
Sufficient unto him was the order of his Master, "Go." Hanumaan is the ideal volunteer; 
efficient, humble, silent, serviceable, intelligent, eager, devoted. 


Develop Bhakthi (devotion) and Shraddha (faithful practice) by means of Naamasmarana and 
Japam. Practise silence and sweetness. Serve all as Saiswaruupa (embodiments of Sai); that is 
the best plan to realise the Sai in you. 


Bombay: Andheri, 29-3-1967 


You must have a separate room or comer where you do Japa or 
dhyaana every day, so that the spiritual fragrance might infuse 
higher thoughts during the process. If the place is changed, it will 


be like changing the company; the cumulative effect of association 
will be squandered. Parents and elders must see that their sons 
and wards are corrected on the spot, whenever they forget or 
deviate from the path. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


15. Precept and example 


INDIA is declared a "secular state" and so the students in the schools are denied any chance to 
receive training in spiritual matters; not even a knowledge of the fundamentals of Sanaathana 
Dharma (eternal universal religion). This is a tragedy. The children have a right to the property 
of their ancestors; but the children of the land have no access to the basis of their ancient culture. 
India is India because of Sanaathana Dharma. It has enabled her to survive many a terrible 
storm; it has kept the country culturally united, in spite of varieties of language and food habits 
and dress. The Raamaayana and Mahaabhaaratha and the Bhaagavatha are revered from the 
Himaalayas to the Cape. The ideals of Sathya, Dharma, Shaanthi and Prema which they uphold 
and exemplify have welded the people and kept them on a path which was beneficial to the 
individual as well as society. 


Sanaathana Dharma is the only religion that declares that there is no religion that can be labelled 
‘one and only.' It says that all religions are but facets of the 'one and only.' It says that all Names 
are names of God, that all Forms are but His Forms. No religion can claim to represent fully the 
Universal, Eternal, Truth. This is the teaching of Sanaathana Dharma. Therefore, if any one 
finds fault with another's faith, he is casting a slur on his own faith. If any one defames another 
religion, he only reveals his ignorance of the nature of religion and the glory of God. 


Education must open the inner eye of the students 


Education must include the education of the mind of man, of his impulses to hate, to hoard, to 
fight, to defame. It is not merely the acquisition of certain skills by which the materials found in 
nature can be reshaped into utility products; it is not merely the acquisition of information about 
the laws of nature. It is the process by which man makes the best of his own inner equipment, his 
Anthahkarana (inner consciousness), to know himself. It should open his inner eye, more than 
his outer; the outer must reveal the glory of God, the inner must reveal the God within. Food 
must contribute to the development of the head; the head must discover the existence of God 
everywhere. 


The rulers of this land have a great responsibility in this matter. They must bring up the children 
of this land, not simply as good mechanics and artisans, skilled hewers of wood and efficient 
drawers of water, but as persons equipped with Sathya, Dharma, Shaanthi and Prema; and so 
able to brave the waves of fortune, to preserve their equanimity under all conditions. Students 
must learn to be good and steady Sevaks and Saadhakas (servants and aspirants of spiritual 
discipline). They have to be taught the Yoga of mind control, not breath control which under 
incompetent leadership might endanger health. I want that they should be given training in these 
matters, by whatever name the training may be called. 


Children should grow in the awareness of the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God. If 
no provision is made for this atmosphere and this teaching, we are denying them their due. Faith 
in man involves faith in God; faith in God creates faith in man. Without faith, man is a creature 
bereft of roots; he dries and withers quickly. Faith in the God within him who makes him say, I, 
I, I, when referring to what he was made to say and act and do by the prompting from within--- 
faith is the sustenance on which Love and Courage, Contentment and Joy grow. Children can be 
easily made aware of this inner I, which has the body as its apparel; they will grow in mutual 
love and cooperation with all men of all lands, when they Know that colour and caste are but 
apparel which do not affect the real Reality. 


Teachers must be like the rishis of old 


Of course, to instill in the minds of the young the value of prayer and of humility and loving 
service to others, the homes where they grow have to be the first schools. The parents have to be 
imbued with faith in the basic truths of this Universal Religion. They must be seen worshipping 
at the family altar, meditating in silence, forgiving the lapses of others, sympathising with pain 
and grief; they should not be seen by the children as worried, helpless, discontented and 
distressed, as if they had no God to lean upon, no inner reserves of strength and courage to fall 
back upon. 


The teachers should be simple, sincere, straight-forward saadhakas, radiating joy and love. 
Emphasis on the standard of living, income and expenditure, calculations of costs and prices in 
terms of rupees and paise will not make a good teacher. He must be like the rishis (sages) of old; 
balanced, contended, quiet, calm scholars who have practised self-control and who carry about 
with them an atmosphere of cool equanimity. 


The friends that the child collects at school and around the home have a beneficial or deleterious 
effect on its growth. Comics, horror stories, terrorism, gunmen pictures and cinema posters that 
degrade man into flesh and skin--these drag the prospective hero into a zero. The child learns to 
worship money and things which money can buy; he admires cruelty and cunning, rather than 
sympathy and love. So the home, the school and the society---all three have to arouse themselves 
and take up this challenge to the future of this great land. 


There are no bad children at all 


Boarding schools and hostels where the teachers and wardens are genuinely interested in thus 
uplifting the corning generation may succeed more than many homes and most schools. But even 
they should not try to shape the children into a predetermined mould. Sanaathana Dharma has 
no set pattern. It admits of infinite variety, based on past achievement and present 
accomplishment. 


It has been suggested that the bad children--there are no bad children at all, there are only ill- 
brought up children---should be isolated and given special attention, so that they may be cured of 
evil tendencies. But I do not like isolating them and directing the attention of every one to them. 
as specially marked out boys. It is not good for them, nor is it good for the others. You may pay 
some special attention unnoticed by the rest of the boys, because they happen to come from 
families that have no roots in spiritual practice: but that is all that is advisable. Of course, a good 
teacher knows how to manage such things, if he or she has the faith and the intelligence. 


There should not be, in My opinion, separate "Moral Instruction" lessons in the curriculum; 
every subject has to be learnt with moral instruction as the thread running through from lesson to 
lesson. By example and precept, in the class-room and on the playground, the excellence of 
intelligent cooperation, of sacrifice for the team, of sympathy for the less gifted, of help to the 
maimed, the weak, the ill and the poor, of love and self-reliance, of silence and prayer has to be 
emphasised. 


Prefer the moral way of teaching all the subjects 


The indirect method of instilling these morals is better than direct teaching through text-books 
and tests. Tell stories from the Upanishadhs and the Bible, from the Bhaagavatha and the 
Raamaayana, the Mahaabhaaratha and the lives of Saints from all nations and all ages, to 
illustrate a point while doing any lesson, in any subject. It is possible to teach even science and 


mathematics in a moral or immoral way. Prefer the moral way. 


One advantage which will accrue when you take this moral uplift programme in right earnest is 
that, through the subtle influence of the children, you are cleansing the atmosphere of the homes 
also. When the boy sits in silence and meditates on the Maker of all this wonder and glory, the 
parents too will react in the same way and the atmosphere of the home will be filled with 
humility and love. 


If an institute is started where the training in Yoga and meditation, and in the proper leadership 
of children in schools is taken up, it will do much good. Senior boys and teachers can live there 
in communication with God for some weeks and return to their schools and workspots charged 
with faith in man and God. That will be the dawn of a revolution in the outlook and the activities 
of the India of today. 


Meeting of Headmasters, Poona, 3-4-1967 


16. The wayside halt 


REFLECT on the Aanandha (divine bliss) we experienced when the Secretary was reciting 
passages from the ancient Vedhas! Reflection on the meaning of the passages recited will give 
even more lasting Aanandha. But on account of a sad decline in our national sense of values, not 
only have the dhothi (traditional men's wear), the thilak (red dot put in the centre of eye brows) 
and the tuft which were the signs of orthodox culture disappeared, but even reverence towards 
the vital truths embodied in the Vedhas has disappeared. That is the tragedy. 


Man is born with a great thirst, a deep hunger, for bliss. He knows he can get it, but he knows not 
from where. He has faint memories of his being the heir to the kingdom of Aanandha. But he 
does not know how to establish his claim to his heritage. Something in him revolts when he is 
condemned to die, to suffer, and to hate. It whispers to him that he is the child of immortality, of 
bliss, of love. But man ignores these promptings and like one who exchanges diamonds for dirt, 
he runs in search of meaner pleasures and sordid comforts. 


However learned a man may be, if he has no sense of value, he is bound to fall. Raavana was the 
ruler of a vast empire; he had untold wealth; his ukase ran to the farthest ends; he knew the 
ancient texts very well. In fact, it is said that his ten heads represent his mastery over the four 
Vedhas and the six Vedhaangas. Yet, as his intelligence was diverted to wicked ends, he had an 
ignominious death. 


Action dedicated to God loses its bad effects 


Intelligence is a double-edged weapon. It can cut the chain and liberate you; it can cause fatal 
wounds and kill. That is why the great manthra which the seekers chant, called Gaayathri (since 
it saves those who recite it), prays to God to preside over the intelligence and render it beneficial 
to the individual and to society. The sufferings depicted in the Raamaayana are due to two 
characters that make only short appearances, but represent the evil force of lust and anger--- 
Surpanakha and Manthara. They poison the minds of Raavana and Kaikeyi respectively and set 
the stage for the tale of grief. 


The education of the emotions and the control of passions are both included in the definition of 
Yoga, the spiritual discipline that purifies the intelligence. To penetrate the thick fog that 
ignorance spreads over Reality, the intelligence must be built on the basis of virtue. When Karma 
(action) is done as dedication and Upaasana (worship) is done as the essential for very life, the 
Intelligence is clarified so much that the fog disappears and the truth is revealed. Karma, when 
engaged in as dedicated to God, loses its deleterious effects for the doer, leaves the consequence 
to God; moreover, he considers every act as an act of worship and so does it to the best of his 
ability. Karma thus becomes transmutted into Upaasana. 


Upaasana starts with some concrete image or idol or Name and Form; then, as the significance 
of the Name and the Form sinks into the consciousness, all names are seen to be God's; all forms 
are felt to be God's. Gradually, the truth that the worshipper too is the same entity, deluding 
himself as separate, because of a separate name and a distinct form, labelling the upaadhi (the 
bodily encasement), becomes evident; this is the dawn of jnaana (spiritual wisdom). 


There is no desire to remove the dirt, but only hide it 


The fog is egoism, which hides the Universal and induces the belief in distinctness; it is a cloud 
of dust, that smothers the truth. People now love the fog and the cloud, they make no effort to 


remove them. When you enter a shop and select cloth for pants or bush shins, you ask for black; 
and the reason why you prefer that colour and dislike white or light shades is that the black will 
not reveal dirt! The desire is not to remove the dirt, but to hide it from gaze. This has become a 
universal weakness. People are not ashamed of dirt; they do not seek cleanliness in the heart. 
That can be won only through Prema and Sathya, through the repetition of the manthra (mystic 
formula) communicated by the Guru and by saadhana, practised regularly and steadily, with 
faith. 


The Andhra Association can well take up this work---having Sathsangs (holy gatherings) on 
Saturdays and Sundays and Thursdays, where spiritual discipline for this inner cleanliness can be 
discovered and practised. Elders must consider how best they can be exemplars in this field for 
the young men and women under their care, those who look up to them for guidance, those to 
whom they are heroes. They should engage themselves in some disciplines like japam and 
dhyaanam, they must evince enthusiasm and satisfaction in those disciplines; they should be 
courageous in calamity and take both good and bad as gifts from God. Then only can the 
children in their care learn to live happily and in peace. 


The parents are like the A.D.C.'s for the child, which is the Mahaaraaja. The A.D.C.'s function 
does not end when he dresses magnificently and struts about; he has to guard the person who is 
entrusted to his care. If the two A.D.C.'s neglect their duties, to however small a degree, or if 
they are not alert and vigilant, there is great danger. So the parents must improve themselves for 
the sake of their children. Example is more profitable than precept. When the parents have no 
reverence for God, when the pictures of Stalin and Hitler, Churchill and Lenin adorn the walls of 
the home, when the child has to breathe the atmosphere of scandal, faction and greed at home, 
how can it grow into a happy, healthy, balanced individual? The films that children are taken to 
see are full of violence and falsehood, mean tricks and conspiracies, which tarnish the springs of 
sympathy and love. 


Some parents are the greatest foes of their children 


There are parents who are proud when their children join them in card games or even drinking 
and gambling; there are parents who get angry when their children read religious books, attend 
temple rites and sit quietly for a few minutes meditating on the awe and wonder the Creation 
evokes in them. How can such parents claim to be the well-wishers of their progeny? They are 
the greatest foes of their progress. They do not equip their children with the armour which will 
render them safe in the turmoil of life. They try to make their children unworthy of the name 
Indian; for they grow up without learning about Raama or Krishna or the Geetha or the 
Bhaagavatha! 


Parents toil to leave their children a pile of riches; but they do not teach them the proper sense of 
values by which they can know how little the riches are worth, or how best to utilise the riches 
for their genuine advancement. Children should be taught to live like lotuses in the lake of 
Samsaara (worldly life), being in water but unaffected by it. Lotuses cannot live when out of 
water; yet, they will not allow water to enter! Be in Samsaara but see that Samsaara is not in 
you. That is the secret of successful living which they do not teach the young. 


Strive for riches that cannot be stolen or taxed 


The riches that you should strive to amass are not fields or factories, bungalows or bank 
balances, but wisdom and experience of oneness with grandeur of the Universe and the Force 


that runs it without a hitch. Arjuna is called Dhananjaya by Krishna because he had won (jaya) 
such dhanam (riches) that saves man, that cannot be taxed or stolen or transferred. The method 
of winning these riches is saadhana. People hesitate to enter the field of saadhana, though they 
crave for the harvest of joy. They are not willing to spend a pie; they want Moksha (Liberation) 
to drop from the heavens in their laps. They would have the vision of God thrust painlessly into 
their brain! 


When Maithreyi was given by Yaajnavalkya vast wealth in the shape of gold and cattle, when he 
left hearth and home on his spiritual quest, she asked him whether they would be of any use for 
her in her quest. When her husband replied that they were transient and cheap when compared to 
the wealth of spiritual experience, she cast them off and sought the precious wealth of thapas 
and shraddha (penance and religious faith). She got eternal joy through them. 


You must see Nature as filled with God, shaped by God, as God, in those shapes and smells and 
sounds. We see the image in the mirror because the light rays are reflected back from the surface 
of the mirror. You are the reflection of the rays of God from the mirror that is Nature. If that 
mirror were not there, the Jeevi (individual soul) does not exist as a separate entity. Remove the 
mirror, then 'you' merges in 'He,' and there remains We. It is Prakrithi (Nature) that induces the 
belief that you are the body, the deha. You feel you too are Name-Form like Prakrithi. This 
identification has led to an inordinate degree of attention to the body and consequently, worry 
and misery. 


Develop the Vision, not the body 


The principle that food is only a drug to cure hunger is ignored and man is enslaved to the 
tongue. All the twenty-four hours are spent in attending to the care of the body, the prevention of 
disease, the promotion of health, the development of muscle, etc. No care is spent on the dehi--- 
the God resident in this physical tabernacle, who has to be recognised and revered. The weighing 
machine, on which you stand and read your weight with pride, laughs at you for the silly 
exaltation. It sneers at your conceit over physical victories; it warns you against too much 
concern over paltry gains. It knows that death is lying in wait to snatch you away, however 
heavy you may grow. Develop dhrishti (vision), not deha (body). Concentrate on the Maker, not 
the 'made.' 


During the battle at Lanka against the Raakshasa (demonic) hordes, a boy sitting on the hip of an 
ogress was wounded by a chance arrow. The mother dropped the child and fled. Lakshmana 
pointed her out to Raama and said, "See, how hard-hearted are these ogresses; they have no love 
in their hearts even for their own children." Raama replied, "Brother, do not condemn them so 
harshly. She may have other reasons for running away." Raama asked him to find out for 
himself. She told Lakshmana that not all ogres were hard-hearted. "Do you not know 
Vibheeshana, who serves Raama so devotedly? Are there no ogres among you, men? Do not 
damn all indiscriminately. Listen. I know that when it is a question of salvation, each is a distinct 
unit. Mother and child may go along different paths and reach the goal, soon, or late; each in his 
or her own time. I must seek my own good. I felt that if I flee and keep alive, Raama may take 
me captive to Ayodhya and grant me the dharshan (audience) that will save me from this 
recurring fate." She had faith in Raama's Divinity and her own ultimate liberation. 


Ash is a lesson in detachment and renunciation 


When you enter a shop and select the thing you want, you have to pay the price; when you sit for 


an examination, you have to write the answers to questions, to the satisfaction of the examiner; 
when you seek to learn swimming, you will have to enter the water and struggle with the strokes. 
When Bhasma (holy ash) is given, doubt haunts some people whether Swaami is wishing that the 
recipient should be a Shaivite (devotee of Shiva)! It is a symbol of the indestructible basic 
substance which every being is. All things become ash; but ash remains ash, however much you 
may burn it. It is also a sign of renunciation, of sacrifice, of Jnaana which burns all karma- 
consequence into ineffective ash. It is a sign of Jshwara, and I apply it on your brow, to remind 
you that you too are Divine. It is a valuable Upadesha (instruction) about your identity. It also 
reminds you that the body is liable any moment to be reduced into a handful of ash. Ash will be a 
lesson in detachment and renunciation. 


Man must live his days without despair and unlimited desire. You should be level-headed, 
without exulting when fortune smiles or drooping when misfortune frowns. Teach your children 
this hard lesson. Prahlaadha, when chastised by his father for disobeying his orders, replied, "He 
alone is entitled to obedience as a father who orders his son to bow to Hari, and to merge in 
Hari---not others." If a father commands the son to revere him as Hari, then he is a bitter foe, not 
a father. The children are the instruments by which Bhaaratha can be raised; go, I had a talk with 
the Headmasters of Poona about their moral and spiritual training. An institution will come up in 
Poona, where parents, teachers and student leaders will be trained to guide them along the right 
lines; where students too will be trained in spiritual practices that will make them strong and 
straight. 


Study of scriptures and religious texts and such books, without effort to practise, results in ill- 
health. Being false to one's professions eats away one's self-respect and one starts getting 
ashamed of oneself. So learn to practise; eat to digest. That is the advice I give you today. 


Andhra Association, Poona, 3-4-1967 


Attachment, affection, interest,---these will create prejudice, 
partiality, illusion; they hide the Truth; they dull the intelligence. 
Raaga is roga (attachment is a disease), so far as the enquirer is 
concerned. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


17. The obliterating flood 


LIKE food to a starving man, like showers on a parched field, the Vedhic science of spiritual 
self-discovery is the life-saver for humanity sliding down to destruction because it has lost its 
hold on truth, morality, peace and love. You are the instruments in the spread of Vedhic science 
among the farthest corners of this vast land; you are the chosen ones! You have to show by 
precept and by example that the path of self-realisation is the path to perfect joy. Hence on you 
lies a great responsibility; the responsibility of demonstrating by your calmness, composure, 
humility, purity, virtue, courage and conviction under all circumstances, that the Saadhana you 
practise has made you a better, happier and more useful person. Practise and demonstrate, do not 
simply assert in words and deny in deeds. 


The Sea is considered holy, holier than any river, because all the rivers pour themselves into it. 
This gathering of workers from all over India is therefore a holy congregation, representing the 
confluence of streams of devotion. It has become imperative to plan out the process of carrying 
spiritual knowledge to every door, for the gigantic flood of the modern machine civilisation is 
fast obliterating all traces of the Divine in man. 


Atmosphere today is fouled by sickly competition 


The Aathma which can confer eternal joy is ignored and man rushes wildly under the sea or out 
into space to cater to his craving for pride and pomp. Some persons have to step forward boldly 
now to declare from their own genuine experience that the joy of reaching the moon is as nothing 
when compared to the joy of reaching the inner moon of Aanandha, and the source of all 
Aanandha, the Aathma. Saying one thing and being another will defeat the very purpose. The 
slightest sign of hypocrisy will weaken the foundations of the edifice. That is why it is necessary 
to lay down certain tests and qualifications, certain broad guide-lines for those who stand forth as 
workers in this field. Standards and systematic self-examination are necessary at every stage for 
the success of every effort. 


The atmosphere today is fouled by hate, greed and sickly competition, which cast out the virtues 
of reverence, humility and equanimity. The world and its ephemeral attractions have become the 
goal of human endeavour. God who is the Source, Sustenance and Supreme Goal, is ignored both 
in the external world and in the inner world of impulse and intellect. So, the organisations you 
are representing have to be ever vigilant and efficient, lest you too are drawn into the vortex. 


I am not keeping you here any longer, for you have to gather in groups and draw up points for 
discussion and clarification, in the further sessions of this Conference; some of you have to meet 
in committees to prepare reports and lists of suggestions and recommendations for presentation 
to the Conference. So, I bless you all and allow you to go, back to your lodgings, so that you may 
met early afternoon for the next stage of the discussion. 


First All-India Conference of 
Bhagawaan Shri Sathya Sai Seva Organisations, Madras, 20-4-1967 


Illness is caused more by malnutrition of the mind than of the 
body. Doctors speak of vitamin deficiency; I will call it the 
deficiency of Vitamin G, and I will recommend the repetition of the 
Name of God, with accompanying contemplation of the glory and 


grace of God. That is the Vitamin G. That is the medicine; 
regulated life and habits are two-thirds of the treatment, while the 
medicine is just one-third only. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


18. Sathya Sai Seva 


THE Vedhas are inspired by the holy spirit of Divine Mercy; they seek to transmit to humanity 
the secrets of a happy life here and of Liberation for ever. They reveal the essence of the Divine 
Glory. They are the source of spiritual knowledge over the millennia for all mankind. The 
Vedhas and the Intellect, which man is endowed with as a gift from God to separate good from 
evil, are the means by which the culture of this land is to be preserved and promoted. When the 
Vedhic treasure house is explored with intelligence, the Aathma-thathwa (essential nature of the 
Self) becomes clear and when that is recognised, man becomes eternally happy and full of peace. 
This treasure was slighted and neglected as a result of the fascination for outlandish ways of life, 
but, since some years, the feeling of reverence and the readiness to repent have appeared among 
the people. 


This Conference is itself a sign of revival. You are allotted the task of bringing once again to the 
homes of the people the message of Aathmic strength and Aathmic unity. Transmuting 'man' into 
'God' and experiencing that Aanandha (Bliss) is the one and only achievement for which life is to 
be devoted. The efforts you make in your own places are directed to bring this goal into the 
awareness of each person. Of course, there are in existence many organisations and societies 
engaged in distributing various cures for the 'spiritual' 'ills of their constituents, and therefore, a 
question may arise about the need for this additional institution. The need has arisen to 
emphasise the basic and essential discipline, which is practical and universal, as prescribed since 
ages for the revelation of the Divine in man. 


Bhaaratheeya Culture has to be fostered first 


The entire Universe is pictured as but the Body of Vishnu, by the Vedhas. And, Bhaarath (India) 
is as the eye of the Universe, the reason being that she has the most correct vision of the Cosmos 
in the context of Time. The mother desires that the son should uphold the honour of the family; 
the son should uphold the fair name of the mother and father. So, every Indian has to learn and 
practise the spiritual science that the sages of this land have explored and discovered. However, 
due to hostile forces, evil company, ignorant fascination, Indians have neglected this foremost 
duty. The infection has come; it is well settled in the organism. Now, it has to be cast out. This 
Conference and the organisations you represent are attempts to cure that illness. The purpose is 
the same, whatever the name---Prashaanthi Vidwanmahaasabha, Sathya Sai Seva Samithi, 
Sathya Sai Seva Dhal, or Sathya Sai Bhaktha Mandaii. 


The first aim is to foster and cultivate Bharatheeya Culture. Let its validity be examined through 
actual living, and one's own discovery of its values; and communicated to others by those who 
have experienced the peace and joy derivable from it. I do not want the extolling of the drug by 
persons who have not been themselves cured by it. Today, in the very land where this culture 
grew and flourished, immorality and corruption have destroyed happiness and contentment. 
Many condemn these things, but those are the very persons who commit the wrongs they 
deplore. Those who profess to lead the people are themselves led astray by the temptation to fall. 
So, the very first ideal you must keep in mind, when you start and run these organisations is: Do 
not crave for status or authority or position; do not allow any pomp, or show; do not compete for 
publicity or recognition or praise. 


Unity Consciousness is the heart-beat of India 


Duty is God. Do it and be content. You may have yearnings towards self-aggrandizement and 


plans to fulfil them; I know that some people have already devised plans for getting into official 
positions; but, you must subdue and destroy those desires. Following My instructions without 
demur, is the best plan. While engaged in Service (Sella), it is wrong to yield to lower cravings 
or to follow one's own impetuosity. The Vedhas declare that it is only by Thyaaga--- 
renunciation, surrender, submission---that immortality can be acquired. 


In the history of India, you must have noticed that all the great movements and empires were 
motivated by spiritual undercurrents, not by political or economic stresses. It is only after the 
advent of the East India Company that politics and the struggle for political power predominated. 
You must make politics subserve the need to promote and perfect the fundamentals of Indian 
(Bhaaratheeya ) culture. 


The Universe is the Body of God; in the Body, the Unity Consciousness is Bhaarath, the Eka- 
bhaava (feeling of Oneness). "Ekam Sath," (The Reality is One) the Vedhas declared aeons ago! 
That is the heart-beat of Bhaarath today. This is the reason why sages, saints, Divine personages 
and Incarnations of God appear here and proclaim their message to mankind from this land. The 
precious message is now being exported, but very little is used inside the country. That is the 
tragedy. 


Sai organisations must promote faith in God 


For the influence available from positions of authority, for acquiring and accumulating power, 
individuals talk ill of others and breed hate. From dawn till dusk and dusk till dawn, the chief 
occupation of people today is finding fault with others, trying to publicise the faults in others. 
This state of things is an insult cast in the face of our hoary culture. It springs from the craving 
for cheap popularity and temporary fame. 


Your organisations must endeavour to promote faith in God. If that base is absent, worship, 
bhajan, puuja, good works---all become meaningless automatic ritual, done under social 
compulsion. Inner transformation, which is the fruit, can be acquired only when these are done 
with faith. Faith can grow only from the root of inquiry. Faith is made firmer by inquiry. You 
must encourage inquiry by the members whom you contact and welcome their efforts to gain 
first-hand experience. 


Man strives to provide himself with food, clothing and housing for the sake of the body; he must 
also provide himself with some things to keep the mind healthy and happy. It is the mind that 
conditions even the body. The mind is the instrument, the fly-wheel, the thickest comrade of 
man. Through it, one can either ruin oneself or save oneself. Regulated and controlled, 
channelised properly, it can liberate; wayward and let loose, it can entangle, and bind fast. Try to 
find out when exactly man is having peace, full undisturbed peace. You will see that he is at 
peace only during sushupti (deep sleep). For, at that time, the senses are inactive, the mind is 
inert and unattached to the senses or their targets. So, when senses are made ineffective to drag 
the mind out, man can attain peace. That is the real saadhana, the basic saadhana: the 
withdrawal of the senses from the objective world (Nivritthimaarga). 


Two fangs that make the individual poisonous 


Train the mind to dwell on the inner equipment rather than the outer attractions. Use the mind to 
cleanse the feelings, impulses, attitudes, tendencies and levels of consciousness. Let it not 
accumulate dirt from the outer world and deposit them within itself. If it is attached to work 
(Pravritthimaarga) the consequences of work get attached to it. Unattached work is the purest; it 


does not encumber the mind with elation or disappointment. 'I did it,' "This is mine': these are the 
two fangs that make the individual poisonous. Pull out the fangs, the snake can be handled and 
played with as a pet. These organisations must be vigilant to see that egoism and the sense of 
personal possession, pride or achievement, do not invade them. That is the goal to be kept in 
view. 


When an organisation is started it has to lay down for itself certain rules and regulations. But our 
rules are of a different nature altogether. Our rules emphasise that members must first practise 
what they stand for. Whatever you desire others to do, you must first put into daily practice 
sincerely and with steadfastness. You must do bhajan regularly and systematically, before you 
advise others about the efficacy of bhajans. When you want to be honoured by others, you must 
learn to honour them first. 


Bhagawaan is the medicine for Bhava-rogha 


Service has become a word of common currency, but its value is very much reduced by the 
hypocrisy of the users. Really speaking, only those who are afflicted with agony,: equal agony, at 
the sight of pain and suffering, distress or disease, have the fight to offer service; for, they are not 
serving others, they are serving themselves, serving to remove as fast and as intelligently as they 
can, their own agony. Service to others is the medicine one needs to alleviate the distress which 
fills one at the sight of distress in another being. Feel that you are serving yourself, that you are 
curbing your own ego. Otherwise service heightens your self-esteem and develops a sense of 
superiority, which are both harmful spiritually. 


Food is the medicine for the illness of hunger; drink, for the illness of thirst; for the disease of 
bhavarogha (Birth-Death-Cycle), Bhagawaan is the medicine; for the disease of desire, Jnaana 
is the specific. For the disease of doubt, despair and hesitation, which are the occupational 
diseases of Saadhakas, the most effective remedy is paropakaara (doing good to others). For the 
major infection of ashaanthi (anxiety), the course of treatment is bhajan. It is to provide these 
remedies to the sufferers that the organisation has to dedicate itself. 


A spiritual organisation is really above all rules and regulations; the realm of the Aathma is 
beyond the limits of regulations. In this sense, rules are either meaningless or superfluous in 
Sathya Sai Organisations. But at least, to satisfy the law of the land dealing with associations of 
this kind, some rules have to be adopted. For example, who can be members of these 
organisations, and what are their qualifications? (1) Of course, they must be eager aspirants for 
spiritual progress. (2) They must have full faith in the Name that the organisation bears and in 
spreading that Name, in the manner suited to Its Message and Majesty. (3) Besides, the member 
must have won recognition as a good person. That is all the qualification needed; nothing else 
counts. There is no need to have money or lands, or scholarship, influence or authority or official 
position. 


Oath must be taken from the very depth of the heart 


If you have the three qualifications mentioned, I assure you, even if you have no place in any 
organisation bearing My Name, you will have a place here (Baaba indicated His Heart as the 
place where they will be accepted). The organisations must be such that members find them 
congenial places to deepen their Saadhana, to cultivate their virtues and to overcome their ego, 
by contact with workers who are free from the least trace of that deadly poison. If this is 
achieved, their success is certain. 


Secondly, what are the duties of members and office-bearers? You know that the State requires 
you to take a solemn oath, when you take up an office or enter upon an assignment. Similarly, 
each member and office-bearer must take an oath, from the very depths of the heart, before 
engaging themselves in the activities. "Swaami, Save me from any act of commission of 
omission which will affect adversely the three qualifications You have laid down. Bless me with 
the skill, intelligence and enthusiasm necessary for the task I am dedicating myself to carry out 
for my own uplift. Guide me along the correct path; shower on me Your Grace so that I may earn 
a fair name in this attempt; guard me from temptation and wrong steps." When you rise from bed 
at dawn, pray thus. At night, when you go to bed, ponder over your activities during the day, 
examining them, whether you went against any of the conditions of membership, and if any 
wrong had been committed unconsciously, pray that it may not happen again. Decide to dedicate 
yourself in this manner, with these ideals for the work ahead. 


Do not develop fanaticism is Sai activities 


Another point I want to emphasise is this: There are many other organisations with spiritual 
objectives in this land, run under different names, attached to other Names and Forms of God, 
like Raama, Krishna. You know that Indian culture insists that you should offer reverence to all 
the names and forms of the One God-head. In your organisations, there may be some who insist 
that only Sai Bhajan should be sung, only the Name and Form of Sathya Sai be used. This is a 
great mistake. You are thereby dishonouring Sai. If you attach yourself to Sai and detach 
yourself from Krishna, you get a plus there and a minus here; the resultant gain is zero. In this 
matter do not develop fanaticism or sectarianism. Others may have these, but that is no reason 
why you should meet them with the same failings. Try your best to avoid such infection. When 
the other organisations require help, go and help them. This will make them realise the loving 
universal nature of your attitude. 


Again, do not encourage differences based on region, language, religion, or any such flimsy 
grounds. For example, people who exaggerate these differences argue in Madras that only Tamil 
songs should be sung or in Andhra Pradesh, that only Thelugu songs should be sung. If such 
ideas are entertained, they will undermine the Adhyaathmik (Spiritual) outlook, the attitude of 
unity and oneness which is the keynote of the spirit. This is a field where inner joy, inner 
satisfaction, internal purity are more important than outer expression. 


I do not like collection of funds. But, since some expense has to be incurred, I have to allow it 
under very stringent conditions. Each organisation has as Members (of the Samithi) about ten or 
fifteen persons. Whatever expense they decide to incur for the work of the Samithi 
(Organisation), they have to collect among themselves, without seeking help from those outside 
the circle. They have, of course, to contribute according to their capacity and limit the work to 
the resources they can pool among themselves. 


A word of warning on collecting funds and spending 


Do not plan beyond your capacity and move about with lists from person to person to get funds. 
By this, the institution gets a bad name and you too will not be spared. You may say, "But, when 
Swaami comes to our place, we must spend a lot on reception arrangements." No, I do not need 
grand decorations, huge pandals, arches, flags and such paraphernalia. I require only a mike to 
communicate My advice to the people. Even a chair is superfluous! I can talk standing. Spend 
sparingly for the minimum needs; do not involve yourselves in expensive luxury. I would like 
you to spend any extra money that you have for the feeding of the poor or for any similar 


beneficial object. 


Attempts are being made in many places to build Sathya Sai Mandhirs (halls of worship). But 
Sathya Sai will be happy if He is installed in your hearts; that is the Mandhir I like, not those. 
When you seek to build that other Mandir, you have to go about seeking donations. Religion has 
declined in this land due to this donation-seeking and donation-granting. Really speaking, the 
most precious donation is a pure mind; give that to the organisation and it will shine. 


I shall tell you a method by which the extra funds you may need for any undertaking the Samithi 
has in view are to be collected. Estimate beforehand what the expense will be. Suppose it comes 
to a thousand rupees, give that information to the fifteen members, and fix a day when they shall 
all meet. That day, keep a locked box with a slit on the lid, in an inner room; let every one go in 
alone into the room and deposit in the box whatever he feels he can. He can come away without 
depositing anything; he has the freedom to do so, there is no compulsion. 


If funds are collected with the knowledge of the rest, a person who is unable to give as much as 
another may feel humiliated and so this is the best method. When all have finished their turn, let 
the box be opened and the amount counted. If it falls short of the estimate, divide the shortfall 
among all members equally and collect the share from each. If there is some surplus, keep it for 
the next occasion. 


Fund collection campaign will lead to calumny 


Do not have lists, appeals, receipt books and all the cumbrous complex of fund collection 
campaigns. That way will lead you to stratagems and falsehoods, competition and calumny. Do it 
in this quiet and sacred manner, suited to the holy objectives you have. 


Some delegates suggested that sub-committees be formed and recognised. But that will increase 
the number and so give room for more mistakes. Let the responsibility be on a few dedicated 
persons. The District President must see that small associations in the villages are given proper 
guidance and help to carry out the task undertaken by them, and to send to those villages, 
exponents of Vedhic culture in order to instruct and inspire them. Attempts should also be made 
to spread spiritual knowledge and instill the yearning for spiritual Saadhana among students and 
youth. 


Do not set limits to celebrations of holy days 


Sathya Sai Seva Samithis have to bear in mind the word, Seva, and take up Seva work 
enthusiastically. Seva must be directed towards the removal of physical distress, the alleviation 
of mental agony, and the fulfilment of spiritual yearning. Some regions are affected by floods, 
some by drought; the Samithi must make efforts to bring relief to the sufferers from these and 
other natural calamities. 


The Bhajan Mandalis, Sathsangs, Bhaktha Mandalis, that are now established must spread the 
message of Naamasmarana, Bhajana and Naamasankeerthana at all times and in all places. 
Jayadeva, Gouranga, Thyaagaraaja---all these moved through the bazaars and streets, singing 
bhajans and songs about the glory of God and their ecstasy filled lakhs and lakhs of people with 
Divine fervour. 


Yesterday, some one read out a list of Holy Days which the associations were to celebrate. That 
list mentioned Shivaraathri, Navaraathri, Swaami's Birthday and Guru Pournami. But you must 
also celebrate the Birthdays of the Mahaathmas who led man to the God within him, and also all 


days held holy by your brothers. Do not set limits to these celebrations and these days. Make 
every day a Holy Day and fill it with the recollection of God and His Messengers. 


Establish unity among yourselves first; do not seek faults in others or excellences in your own 
selves. The Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man---have full faith in this and fill every 
act of yours with that reverence and love. Meet together once a week or once a fortnight or at 
least once a month; have some one to discourse to you, or engage in bhajan or study or dhyaana; 
experience the thrill of spiritual comradeship. Every member of the association must have some 
item of work allotted to him and he must be present whenever such meetings are held, unless of 
course it becomes physically difficult. 


I must tell you about another point also. Wherever you are, whatever work you do, do it as an act 
of worship, an act of dedication, an act for the glorification of God who is the inspirer, the 
witness, the Master. Do not divide your activities as, "These are for my sake" and "These are for 
the sake of God." Even if you divide zero by zero, you get one. 


When you work, there should be no remainder, nothing should remain over. See all work as one. 
You should not, the Shaasthras say, leave any remainder or balance in debts, in disease, in 
vengeance against enemies, in the cycle of birth-death. Finish all, down to the last. They should 
not recur again. If you offer all activities at the feet of the Lord and free them from any trace of 
egoistic attachment, the consequence will not bind you: you are free, you are liberated, you have 
Moksha. 


First All-India Conference of Bhagawaan Shri Sathya Sai 
Seva Organisations, Madras, 21-4-1967 


Silence has to be started with oneself; that is to say, one must talk 
less, and think more deliberately, more discriminatingly. One must 
try to empty the mind of impulses and prejudices and preferences. 
Thus, man must strive to reach down to his real nature or dharma, 
which is Divine, Dharmaswaruupa (righteousness personified). 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


19. The journey in the jungle 


THE glory of Bhaarath is indescribable. Its people have reached the Himaalayan heights of 
spiritual endeavour and handed down vast treasures of wisdom for all mankind. But of late, little 
men search for coal in the diamond mine! Children of this land must seek and secure the gems 
and be proud of the achievements of their forefathers. The Vedhaantha Shaasthra (spiritual 
science) is the basic science for the happiness of the individual and of the community of man. It 
preaches unity, peace and the existence of the Divine in man. 


Three texts are considered authoritative by the seekers of this land: the Upanishadhs, the 
Bhagavadgeetha and the Brahmasuuthras. These three teach the essentials for the higher life of 
the spirit. In order to make the teaching clear to the uninitiated, three great commentators, one 
after the other, wrote elaborate interpretations of these texts, and since each of them had one 
particular viewpoint, the three saw in the selfsame texts three different but not divergent paths to 
the goal of liberation. Shankaraachaarya elucidated them from the Adhwaithic (non-dualistic) 
point of view, Raamanujaachaarya from the Visishthaadhwaithic (qualified dualistic) and 
Madhwaachaarya from the Dhwaithic (dualistic) point of view. 


Dhwaitha philosophy or the dualistic point of view declares that the Jeevi (individual) is Jeevi 
and Dheva (Universal) is Dheva and the twain shall ever be only two. The Adhwaitha school of 
philosophy declares that there is only one Entity (Dheva) and that the Jeevi is a false 
improvisation which ignorance conceives, because it is not able to realise the Universal which 
alone exists. There are no two; Adhwaitha means 'No-two.' Visishthaadhwaitha, special or 
peculiar 'no-two-ness,' declares that Jeevi is a limb of the Universal, a component, but a distinct 
component of the One. 


Faith should be patent even when suffering 


All three are genuine paths to the same goal; and, those who follow one cannot change over to 
another all of a sudden. A car cannot change over to another all of a sudden. A car cannot fly in 
the air, nor can a plane taxi along the road to the destination. 'I am the Son,''God is My Father," 'I 
and My Father are one'---these declarations of Christ are significant in this context. As one's 
vision gets clearer and sharper, one's knowledge of oneself and the Universal in which he is 
involved becomes clearer, sharper and truer, until it becomes the very breath, the very core of his 
existence. 


There was a famous scholar once who earned great fame as a Vedhic exponent, but no one could 
guess his caste. Many suspected that he was not a Brahmin, but there was no means of 
discovering. At last, the wife of a Pandith said she could easily solve the problem. The scholar 
was invited for a feast at the place and when he was fast asleep after a full repast, she applied to 
the sole of his foot a red-hot brand at which the Vedhic scholar yelled "Allah." Thus it was 
discovered he was a Muslim. Faith should not be a matter of exposition only; it should be patent 
even when you yell in pain. 


Pathanjali in his Yogasuuthras says: "Yogah Chiththa vriththi nirodhaha"---"Yoga is restraining 
the agitations natural to the mind." Man alone is endowed with the equipment needed to establish 
mastery over the senses. Birds, beasts and other species have no such capacity to discriminate 
and renounce. They act on instinct or impulse; they cannot argue, assess, accept or reject. 


Stick to your innate nature whatever may happen 


A hermit was one day bathing in the Ganga, when he saw floating downstream on a piece of 
wood a scorpion. This is God encased in the scorpion form and name, he felt; he wanted to save 
the scorpion. So, he took it on his palm; but, when it stung him, he dropped it on the waters. 
Then he was stricken with remorse and so, he lifted it up again. Thus is stung him five or six 
times; but, he persisted in his mission of mercy and at last, managed to drop it on dry land so that 
it could go its way, alive and happy. Many people watched his efforts and laughed at him for his 
stupidly exaggerated sympathy. The hermit told them that the scorpion had taught him a lesson 
and he was thankful for it. They asked him what it was. He said: "Stick to your innate nature, 
whatever may happen---that is what it has taught me." Its nature is to sting; it stung, regardless of 
whom or when. 


Man's nature is to achieve Jnaana; Aanandha is man's essence. Love is the bloodstream that 
sustains him; peace is the vision that guides and directs him. That is the reason why he is 
addressed as 'Amrithasya puthra,' in the Upanishadhs---he is the son of immortality; he is 
eternal; he has no birth nor death. In the Geetha, Krishna declares that among the mountains, He 
is Himagiri, the Himaalayas. From this, you should not infer that Krishna was a patriot who 
spoke a good word about a physical feature of His mother-country. To reach the Himaalayas, the 
abode of the pure, white, cool, snow (symbol of the Saathwik virtues)you have to pass through 
Haridhwar (the gate way of God-awareness) and through Hrishikesha (control of the senses). 
Then only can you be the liberated soul, which is of the same essence as He. That is the inner 
meaning of this statement by Krishna. Unless you know the inner and the correct meaning, faith 
will be uncertain and practice spasmodic. 


The three tragedies and the cure to overcome them 


The consequence of avoiding the knowledge and practice of Vedhaantha is the increase of three 
tragedies: Paapam, Thaapam, Ajnaanam (Sin, Suffering and Ignorance). The Name usually 
given to the Reality that you are, namely, Raama, is the cure for all three. Aathma is known as 
Aathmaaraama because Raama means that which pleases and nothing confers such vast 
inexhaustible joy as the Aathma. So, the word Raama means the Aathma. That word consists of 
three components: Ra, and ma. 'Ra' is the mystic representative of Agni (Fire) principle; it burns 
sin into ash, 'a' is the symbol of Suurya (Sun) principle; it destroys the darkness of ignorance. 
‘Ma’ is the symbol of Chandra (Moon) principle; it cools the Thaapam or heat of suffering. So, 
"Raama' overcomes all the three tragedies and reveals the Truth, the Beauty and Goodness. 
Repeat the Name, Raama with this significance in mind and you can feel its effect very soon. 


Man is Aathmaswaruupa (of the nature of Aathma), which is Truth, Beauty, Goodness, Peace 
and Love. But he craves against his nature, for the false, the fleeting, the crude, the inert and the 
chaotic. This is demeaning and disgraceful. Man must turn his face away from these and seek in 
himself the source of strength and joy. He must always have in view God, of whom he is an 
expression, when he does any act. 


The Kannakaanda of the Vedhas which prescribes Yaagas and Yajnas (Vedhic rituals of 
sacrifice) is designed to secure for man the Grace of God and not, as is often assumed, a happy 
life in Paradise. The prompting should arise not from desire for Paradise, but from desire to 
obtain Grace, to dedicate the Yoga to God, leaving the benefits therefrom to the will of the 
Bestower. Nachiketa taught his father this superior outlook on the subject of Yaaga and Yajna. 
The emphasis must be not merely on ritual correctness, but unconditional surrender to the God 


who is invoked and propitiated in these rituals. 
Sacrifice the animal characteristics in yaaga 


For example, the texts speak of Bhuthabali---offerings to the Elements, as a rite to be observed. 
The common meaning of bali is sacrifice of an animal, but the correct meaning of bali is a tax, a 
tribute, an impost. It is from the taxes paid by the people that the government is able to provide 
various services and comforts for better living. So too, it is from the consolidated funds of these 
balis that the Divine in the elements are providing humanity the benefits they derive, which will 
facilitate the acquisition of jnaana (spiritual knowledge). In the Yaagas and Yajnas, Bhuthabali 
forms an important rite. Sacrifice the animal characteristics like pride, hatred and passion and 
save yourselves. 


When you go to a shop to provide yourself with something you need, you know that you cannot 
get it without paying its price. You have come here in order to get some inspiration, or 
information, or some glimpse of the inner treasure that you possess and of the means of 
benefitting by it---call it Aathmasaakshaathkaara, Moksha, Aathmathathwa or Liberation, 
Nirvaana or anything else. You have come to this shop for it; we are selling the thing you need. 
But you are hesitant to pay the price. "The mouth is closed tight when the bit and the bridle are 
brought; it opens wide when gram or grass is brought" is said of horses. It should not be said of 
men. So, when you come to gatherings like this you must come, aware of the precious ware that 
is here available, and anxious to assimilate as much as possible. Eager attention now, reflection 
later on what has been heard---that is the price you have to pay. 


There is no use of reading without practising 


Reflect and put into practice what you recognise as beneficial in what you have listened to. 
Practice gives you the golden harvest of blissful experience. If you spend all your time in 
erecting the fence, when are you to raise the crop? When you spend all your time in reading 
about agriculture and of the excellent crops that can be got by using high yielding strains of 
seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, etc., but do not plough, or sow, or spray or dig or pull out the weeds, 
how can the granary be full? Reading, reciting, listening---these are not enough; practise is what 
is needed. 


If you are told that Nachiketa did this or Svetaketu said that, of what avail is it? Unless you adopt 
them as your ideals, exemplars, guides, these Upanishadhs and scriptural texts are only fairy 
tales! Try to understand their steadfastness, their faith, their sense of values, their virtues and 
their uprightness. And yearn to acquire them. They only can we have another Nachiketa and 
another Svetaketu. Or else, in the entire course of human history, there will be only one 
Nachiketa and one Svetaketu! 


Learn lesson from the events around you 


You have seen hundreds of funerals; but no lesson has been learned. Buddha saw but one. It 
changed the course of his life and opened a new chapter in the history of the world. You have 
seen long processions of Sanyaasins; Buddha saw only one Sanyaasi. You have seen sick men 
by the hundreds. The renunciation of the Sanyaasins, the suffering of the sick, the pitiable 
condition of the aged---these made profound impression on Buddha. He left his palace, his wife 
and new born child to seek the remedy for the miseries of life. If you cultivate a mind that will 
welcome such transforming impressions, these discourses will benefit you. 


When all the millions who gather all over this ancient land to listen to spiritual discourses, put 


into practice a tenth of what they hear, Bhaarath will rise once again to the pinnacle of spiritual 
glory. But do not despair when confronted by the obstacles, the atmosphere, the handicaps, the 
dissensions and the doubts. They are all good omens, no unpropritious ones. You will soon 
delight in the restoration of Sanaathana Dharma to its pristine glory. This must happen, it will 
happen, it shall happen. 


Meanwhile, without losing heart, you should determine your path and pursue it unwaveringly. A 
celebrated sage once advised an aspirant that he could get God-realisation, in thirty days, if he 
spent all the twenty-four hours in the contemplation of God. He went to his place, did as he was 
told and after thirty-six days (he continued for six more days!) he hurried to the sage, in great 
rage, for he was sadly disappointed. The sage asked him for an account of his daily schedule of 
activity during the thirty-six days. The disciple said, "Well, I rise from bed at four o'clock wash 
and get ready for Dhyaana by five, meditate until six, move about until eight, have something to 
eat, doze off for a few minutes, read a few pages, converse with friends for a while on the 
happenings in the world, bathe and drink something hot afterwards, etc., etc., with Raamanaama 
now and then, in the intervals." The sage answered, "Wonderful indeed! I did not anticipate you 
will behave so crudely. I directed you to use all the twenty-four hours in the contemplation of 
God, without wasting a single moment. I did not lay down any other schedule. Spend as much 
time as there is in thirty days, in the unalloyed contemplation of God; you will attain liberation." 


Meaning of unalloyed contemplation on God 


The best method of carrying out the sage's direction is to believe that this body is the residence 
of God; that the food you take is the offering you make to Him; your act of bathing is the 
ceremonial bathing of Him who is in you; the ground you walk on is his domain; the joy you 
gain is his gift; the grief you experience is His lesson. Remember Him ever, in sun and rain. day 
and night, asleep and awake. That is the unalloyed contemplation he advised the pupil to do. 


Life is a jungle, where there is a great ideal of dry wood which harbours worms and insects. No 
one cleans the floor of the forest, or cuts away the undergrowth of bush and bramble. To wade 
through the thorns and the leech-ridden floor of the jungle, one has to wear boots. So too, one 
has to wear the boots of sense-regulation if one has to pass through the jungle of life, without 
harming oneself. This is the lesson I want you to carry home with you today, for pondering over 
and for practise. 


Prashaanthi Vidwaanmahaasabha, Madras, 22-4-1967 


20. The Race and the Prize 


MAN'S life has a beginning and an end; the beginning and the end are both governed by the law 
of cause and effect. The nest of a bird built with arduous circumspection on the branch is swayed 
by the gale and felled by the storm. The lovely petals of the rose, dancing in the breeze, and 
spreading fragrance around, are blown to the ground by the sudden gust of wind! Man too is 
floored at the height of his triumph by the stroke of some unseen hand. Man is aghast at the 
consequence that he experiences; he is unaware of the cause, for he has no inclination to seek it. 
The cause for birth is the same as the cause for death' fascination for sense-objects and the trail 
of activity that it involves. 


Children are happy since they have not yet got involved in such activity. They scatter joy and 
enthusiasm, innocence and confidence. How comes it that they are so fresh and gay? Their minds 
are free from the infection of sense-pleasure-seeking. They are ravelling in the untainted joy of 
their own innate nature. That is the reason why Christ fondled a child, and advised all the grown- 
ups to become children, so that they may be saved. How sweet is the smile of the babe in the 
cradle or of the child playing in the garden? That is the genuine nature of man which he tarnishes 
foolishly, year by year, as he grows. 


Move on and climb ahead towards the goal of God 


In the pure pellucid lake in the heart of man, the Lotus of Divine aspiration is blossoming; 
instead of offering that flower at the Feet of God, you try the trick placing there flowers that 
fade, fruits that rot, and leaves that dry. Offer the heart that He has endowed you with, filled with 
adoration and love! Your Aanandha is my Aahaara (sustenance), so, cultivate it. It grows only 
when you meditate on the source of Aanandha, the goal of Aanandha, namely, God. Seetha was 
interned by the cruel King Ravaana in the most beautifully laid-out garden in Lanka, called 
Ashokavana (the Forest of No-sorrow). The flower-beds, lawns and greeneries, trees and 
creepers, bowers and groves were most pleasing to the eye and refreshing to the mind. But, 
Seetha derived no joy therefrom! She found therein only empty vanity, lust for power and foul 
pleasure. But, Seetha felt real Aanandha when an ugly monkey started repeating the name of 
Raama from the branch of the tree under which She sat! That name was for her the source of 
unfailing Aanandha. 


The stage of life, the status in society, the profession, the company into which you are ushered, 
the recreation you like---all these are to be used by you for cleansing the inner mirror, so that 
God may be reflected clearly therein. Grihasthaashrama (the householder stage of life) is a step 
in the ladder to God-realisation. You do not settle down on a step, or stay on a rung, or build a 
home on a bridge. Move on, climb ahead, cross over, towards the goal of God. From Tham (this 
world) you proceed to Param (the world beyond); through the practise of the Dharma (code of 
virtuous conduct), pertaining to life in the world as a member of the human community, you 
transcend it and earn the right and the qualification to know about the Dharma of the beyond, the 
Nature and Glory of the Divine. [ha dharma gives Aanandha; but Paradharma reveals to you the 
source of Aanandha and merges you in that source. 


In reality there is 'no bondage and no release' 


The Lord, who incarnates to restore Dharma, Himself advises the renouncing of all Dharma for 
the sake of the ultimate Liberation or Moksha and in the same Bhagavadgeetha He recommends 
in the last chapter the giving up of even the craving for Moksha or Liberation, for there is in 


reality, "no bondage and no release." It is only a delusion born of ignorance, which disappears 
when the Light of knowledge is allowed to illumine the place where Darkness prevailed. 


When you know that you are ill, you should try to take such a medicine that you will not need 
any other medicine, ever afterwards. You should not fall ill again. When you engage in activity, 
you must choose such an activity that will not involve you in its chain of consequences. Karma 
must be such that it does not involve you in further karma. Karma dedicated to God, karma done 
in a spirit of surrender, with no concern for the consequence---these alone can prevent the 
sprouting of further shoots from each individual karma. 


As a result of recent movements in world-thought man's heart is being hardened by hate and 
greed, not softened by love and sympathy. Intelligence (the ‘dhee') which the Gaayathri prayer 
attempts to urge into enlightened activity, blinds man from recognising in the beauty of nature, in 
the sublimity of space, time and causation, the might and majesty of God. It is perverted so much 
that questions like, "Where is God to be found?" "Why does He not reveal Himself to me now?" 
arise in the mind. 


You can find God if only you look into yourself and understand yourself. He can be realised only 
after a long process of cleansing and at the end of a systematic disciplined preparation. Without 
learning the alphabet, how can any one dare condemn a classic? The culture embedded in the 
ancient texts promoted the composure and mental poise that is needed to delve into the depths of 
one's being. It is concerned with making every one aware of the Aathma, the basic Truth, the 
only entity of which everything else is a by-product. 


Religion is the product of awareness 


Confusing religion with social customs like taking a bride, or dining with some one or declining 
to do so, people talk glibly discarding religion or disregarding it. Religion is the Mother and how 
can any one do without her or deny her or discard her? You can divorce a wife and marry again; 
but, you cannot deny a mother and declare another as the person who gave birth to you. Religion 
is not constituted of human fancies; it is the call of the Spirit from which we have come, of the 
Sea in the heart of the river. It is the sense of kinship one feels, when one sees other beings 
immersed in grief or joy. It is the exultation one feels when one experiences Truth, Beauty and 
Goodness. He who denies religion, has no discrimination, no heart, no feeling, no emotion. 
Matham (religion) is the product of mathi (awareness). Only, he who has none of these will 
argue that Religion is harmful or superfluous. 


You can pluck a few leaves off the tree or chop off a few of its branches, but the Tree of Religion 
is deep-rooted in the human heart; it can never be destroyed or ignored. The fact that the body is 
but a shaky receptacle that is liable to crash any moment, that the senses are imperfect 
instruments of knowledge, that objects are not per se sources of pleasure or happiness, that the 
sense of 'T' persists in deep sleep too--these cannot be denied by decree or by swearing them off. 
Like all attainments, the attainment of self-realisation also involves hard discipline and 
concentrated effort. The price has to be paid! 


Love the highest, Love the Most Lovable, God 


Let us suppose you are abused, reviled, and grievously hurt, in a dream! Though you are pained 
at that time, when you awake, you are not aware of what has happened so realistically a few 
minutes ago. So too, when you awake into the higher consciousness of Jnaana (spiritual 
wisdom), all the grief and joy, the pleasure and pain you experience in the waking stage are 


found to be as ephemeral as dreams. Report to the police that you killed a person; they will throw 
you into the lock-up. Tell them you killed him in your dream, they will brush you aside as a 
nuisance. 


Having come upon the world stage as 'man,' one should act the role effectively. The tree is 
known by the fruit. The human body is the temple of God. He is installed there. Yearn for the 
realisation of this Truth, seek to discover It and derive Bliss therefrom---that is Bhakthi 
(Devotion, the path of Love to God). Love the Highest, Love the most Lovable; do not love 
anything. 


There was a Pandith once who taught grammar and rhetoric to a group of pupils. After finishing 
a course of lessons, he gave them an assignment to compose four lines of poetry. One young 
man, who struggled with himself to produce appropriate rhyme, had the first two lines: 


The Full Moon is shining bright 

The tree has fruits at a height; 
and in his despair; he completed that quartrain with 
two more lines, more absurd than those two 

The food is not cooked aright! 

Ganganna's face is a horrid sight! 

The assignment of course is completed; but, how 
futile, how pathetic, how worthless the result. 
By meditation alone can you develop good vision 


Man's years of life are also spent in such futilities. He completes the assignments of spending the 
allotted years, but how worthless is the achievement! Every one composes the four lines; but do 
they make any sense? Do they deserve attention or appreciation? No. They pursue every will-o'- 
the-wisp, every chance desire, every line of thought, and are satisfied that they have 'lived.' But, 
this complacence is entirely misplaced. When the accounts are closed and debit and credit 
calculated, what is the profit earned? 


You have wandered far and wide, but neglected your home. You peep into the stars in space, but 
keep your inner sky unexplored. You peep into other's lives and pick faults, and talk ill of them; 
but, you do not care to peep into your own thoughts, acts and emotions and judge whether they 
are good or bad. The faults you see in others are but projections of your own; the good that you 
see in others is but a reflection of your own goodness. By dhyaana (meditation) alone can you 
cultivate the good vision, the taste for good listening, good thoughts and good deeds. 


By Dhyaana, you get immersed in the idea of the Universality and the Omnipotence of God. Is it 
not your daily experience that a bigger worry overpowers the smaller one and makes you forget 
it? When you fill your mind with idea of God and yearn for Him, and pine plaintively for Him, 
all lesser desires and disappointments, and even achievements will pale into insignificance. You 
will forget them all; they will be submerged in the flood of Divine yearning and very soon, in the 
Ocean of Divine Bliss. 


Yearn for God, all lesser yearnings will disappear 


I shall give an example from the Raamaayana, which will make this point clear. When 


Dhasharatha the Emperor died, there was no one at hand to perform the obsequies and so, they 
sent word to the younger sons, Bharatha and Shathrughna, who had left for their kinsman's 
capital. They were not informed of the death, and when they came and saw the body, they were 
too shocked at the inert silence of their dear father, that they ran to Kaushalya, the Queen, their 
step-mother. She burst into tears when the two boys ran into her apartments. They were shocked 
at this and inquired why. It was then that she broke the sad news of the death of their father. 


Bharatha was plunged in grief at this tragedy; he wept aloud, beating his breast. It was 
inconsolable agony. Then amidst the distress, he said, "Mother, how unfortunate I am. I had no 
chance to nurse him in his illness, during his last days. Alas, dear brother, you too lost the, 
precious chance of service," he said, patting Shathrughna on the head. After some moments, he 
continued, "Mother, how fortunate are Raama and Lakshmana. They were with him. They nursed 
him and ran on little errands for him. They were with him when he breathed his last. Since we 
were far away, did father leave any command for us? What was his last wish regarding us? Did 
he remember us, ask that we should be sent for?" Kaushalya said, "Son, he had only one word on 
his lips, one form before his eye; that word was Raama, that form was Raama." Bharatha looked 
surprised. He asked, "How is it that he uttered the name and craved for the form of Raama, who 
was by his bedside, and did not yearn for me who was far away? O, how unlucky I am? Have I 
lost the affection of my dear father?" Kausalya replied, "Well, if Raama was by his bedside or 
near him, he would not have passed away." 


Bharatha ejaculated, "Mother, where had Raama gone? Why was he away? Where is he now? 
Did he go _a-hunting to the forest? Was he on a pleasure trip on the Sarayu?" The mother said, 
"No, no. He went into the forest for fourteen years." Bharatha Could bear it no longer. "Alas, 
what an outrageous tragedy, this? What crime, which sin, did Raama commit to deserve this 
exile? Why had he to go?" "Your mother wished that he should go, and so he went:" said the 
Queen. When Bharatha heard this, the grief that he sustained on heating of the death of his father 
paled, and the grief that arose at his mother sending Raama into exile for fourteen years 
supervened overwhelming all else. The greater grief scours off the smaller. 


So too, the greater yearning will dominate and deluge the lesser. So, yearn for God, and all lesser 
yearnings will disappear. Loss or gain, honour or dishonour, health or ill-health, joy or grief--- 
keep the mind steadily pointed towards God; that is the goal; that is the prize,for the race of life. 
Overcome all obstacles by means of that faith, treat the obstacles as ineffective and futile and 
have the goal alone in view. Visualise God, seek God and merge in God---that is the duty of 
man. 


Prashaanthi Vidhwanmahaasabha, Madras, 23-4-1967 


21. Be a Snake Charmer 


"VYAASO Naaraayano Harih," it is said; that is to say Vyaasa who compiled the story of the 
different manifestations of God, the Mahaabhaaratha and Bhaagavatha, and thus made it possible 
for mankind to know the glory and majesty of Naaranyana, is himself a manifestation of 
Naaraayana; in other, words, he must have been impelled, and inspired, by Naaraayana, whose 
instrument he became, through His Will. The Divine that is as omnipresent as the radio waves 
carrying the programmes of the different stations was received and reproduced by Vyaasa, so 
that mankind can listen and know, know and adore, adore and achieve. This day, the services of 
Vyaasa are remembered with gratitude by all who seek God, and see Him in all that creates 
wonder and awe. 


In children, the mind is in its native purity, for, they have no sense of 'mine.' Jesus took a child 
up and fondling it, carried it on his shoulder. Children are innocent angels. But, when they grow 
up, they start developing desires, desires lead to greed, pride, hate, malice, envy; thus, peace is 
lost and fear and anxiety take its place. To regain the peace and joy of childhood, man struggles 
in devious ways, ways that lead him deeper and deeper into the morass. Can blind pursuit take 
you to the goal? Can disease be cured by handling the phial? Can the snake be killed by beating 
the mound? Peace and joy can be secured only by realising that they are one's own real nature. 


The devotee must be skilled in controlling the senses 


When you emerge into the world, you have no thirst for sensual pleasure; when you make your 
exit from the world, you have no such thirst. Why suffer from it, between birth and death? Do 
not allow it to enslave you and blind you to the goal. Vyaasa taught that man has a far greater 
task to do, between birth and death---to learn and practise the Divine Path. The senses are cobras, 
which man is now enraging by his desires: when they are excited by the heavy thuds of desire, 
they raise their hoods and strike. If they are charmed by the music of bhajan chants, full of the 
melody of devotion, they swing but do not strike. That is the secret of making them harmless. 


The bhaktha must be a daksha (an expert), with the knowledge and skill, the know-how of 
controlling the senses and sublimating the mind. In the Puraanas there is mention of a Daksha, a 
supreme sovereign, who had a daughter, Sathi. Yes; if you are such an expert in the science of 
spiritual progress you can call Sathi (the wisdom relating to the Aathma) your own. Sathi is 
wedded to (Shiva) God, according to the Puraana story. Yes; Aathmajnaana is wedded to God 
and so, one can merge in God, if one has the knowledge of the discipline and one practises them. 
A person who has not acquired this skill is merely a human biped; he does not deserve any 
higher nomenclature. He is as unimpressive, as inglorious, as insignificant, as purposeless, as a 
chariot without axle, as skimmed milk; as a moonless night; as a lotus-less lake. 


Vyaasa has said something that gives hope to those who feel that this skill is unreachable by 
them. He has declared, "I shall tell you in half a verse the gist of all that I have tried to teach, 
through the eighteen voluminous Puraanas---listen! It is an act of merit to be of service to 
others; it is a sin to harm others." Believing in this, if you sincerely, unhesitatingly, constantly, 
gladly, lovingly, offer all your skill and strength to the service of others, God will melt and move 
and manifest Himself in you, before you, with spontaneous Grace. 


The three forms of worship Shiva likes 


It is not a big problem or a laudable achievement to feed the little stomach and find a few feet of 


space to sleep. One can manage to live until the call of death releases one from bondage to the 
body; the greater problem is how to live like a hero, as master of the inner enemies---lust, anger, 
greed, attachment, pride and hate; how to train the mind, how to listen to the dictates of the 
Intelligence rather than the senses, and accept Dharma and Brahman (Righteousness and the 
Absolute Reality) as the two guide-lines of life. 


Shiva has the trident, three-pronged spear, as His weapon; He is worshipped with the bilva leaf, 
which is tri-foliate. The significance is that Shiva likes the three forms of worship, namely, 
Bhakthi, Jnaana and Vairaagya (Devotion, Spiritual Wisdom and Detachment). You should not 
pray to God for secular advantages. You should pray only for Grace. That one-pointed devotion 
can be got only by long practice of saadhana, especially, the Saadhana of Naamasmarana 
(Remembering God through his Name). Thank the Lord for giving you this life, this much 
intelligence, this much detachment; do Naamasmarana with this gratefulness in the background 
of your mind. 


You toil day and night for this Loka (world); how many minutes do you devote for Lokesha (the 
Master of the world)? The Lokesha is the witness of all the worlds. He is to be remembered with 
gratitude and reverence and wonder. Vyaasa spread the glory of Lokesha and made men aware of 
the debt they owed to God. His day is fixed as a holy day, on the Full Moon Day, for he fills the 
dark heart with cool, comforting light, the Light that is transmitted from God. It does not 
emanate direct from him. So, it is moonlight and his Day is on a Full Moon Day. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 23-5-1967 


The mind flutters about and squats on all and sundry objects in the 
Universe. It refuses to stay only on one idea, God. Like the fly that 
sits on fair and foul, but denies itself the pleasure of sitting on a 
hot cinder, the mind too flees from all thought of God. The fly will 
be destroyed, if it sits on fire; the mind too is destroyed, when it 
dwells on God, for, the mind is but a pattern of desire woven with 
the warp and woof of the same material 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


22. Vedha Vyaasa 


VYAASA fulfilled the great task of communicating to Nara the Naaraayanathathwa (essential 
nature of God). He gave the key to the mystery of God to man. This is possible only for one who 
was born charged by God so to do; that is why, Vyaasa is called, Vyaaso Naaraayano Harih--- 
Vyaasa is Naaraayana Himself, He is Haft. He described the Glory of the Lord by means of the 
Bhaagavatha, the Mahaabhaaratha and the Puraanas. Incidentally He elaborated also on the 
mystery of Divine Incarnations. As the radio receiver enables us to catch the melody in the air, 
Vyaasa enables us to catch the splendour of God, which is immanent everywhere. 


Vyaasa is called the Aadiguru, for He is the first and foremost among the Teachers in India and 
of mankind. He is called Lokaguru (World Teacher), in honour of this role. Each mission 
requires a prime mover: you may have the lamp, oil, and wick but, some one must light it; you 
may have the flowers and the thread, but, some person talented in that time must string them into 
a garland or form them into a bouquet; you may have both gold and the desire for jewels, but, a 
smith with the skill must shape it into the coveted ornament; you may have the training and the 
yearning, but some Guru must provide the answer to the questions that torment you; and 
illumine you. 


Children are embodiements of Peace 


Life is a long garland of blossoms, fair and faded, fragrant and futile. They are, so to say, the 
good and bad of life. Man recognises only the blossoms, happy over some, unhappy over most; 
he does not see the string on which they are bound together, the Brahmasuuthra, the lasting fade- 
less Brahma-principle that gives stability to the short-lived flowers. Just as sparrows during a 
storm fly towards a warm shelter. Man too must take shelter in the Divine Principle to escape 
from the storms of life. He will be welcomed by the Divine, only when, as Jesus said, he 
becomes a child. Allow the children to come to me, he said. Children have no strong wishes to 
run after; they have no overpowering passion of hate or greed; so they are embodiments of 
Peace. 


When children grow older, egoism, pride, envy, malice, hatred, anger begin to enslave them and 
they are overcome by anxiety and fear. So, one must recapture the years of childhood, to be in 
Prashaanthi (tranquility). Saadhana (spiritual practice) can accomplish this seemingly 
impossible transformation. Of course, the snake inside will not die, if you rain blows on the 
mound under which it lives. You will have to forego sleep and rest and food---that is to say, be 
content with what you get---and follow the discipline prescribed. Then only can you know 
yourself, and know that you and the Universe are one. This the Naaraayanathathwam that is in 
man; it is that thathwam (reality-principle) that urges you to discover it, through the guide-lines 
laid down by Vyaasa and others who came after him. 


The deadly cobra (sensual desire) that lies coiled in the mound (mind) is now being enraged and 
made to hiss with spread hood by man's activities; he does not know the charmer's art, by which 
he can play with it and make it a docile plaything. You must have seen the charmer playing upon 
a pipe the tune that subdues the cobra; sing the Names of God, sing about His Glory and the 
cobra of sensual greed will become harmless. That is why the Bhaagavatha lays emphasis on 
bhakthi, on keerthana, on Naamasmarana. 


Without Prema in heart, one cannot contact God 


If you become a daksha (skilled person) by means of anapeksha (desirelessness), then you can 
merge in the Shivathathwam, unlike the Daksha of Dakshayajna who had apeksha (craving for 
the fruits) and so, lost the Shivathathwam he had become akin to. Prema which is the essence of 
bhakthi is built on anapeksha; if there is apeksha, it becomes bargaining and not Love unsullied 
by gross considerations. 


You may become a master of all the texts Vyaasa composed, the Mahaabhaaratha, the 
Bhaagavatha and the 18 Puraanas, the Brahmasuuthras, etc, but, if you have no Prema welling 
up in your heart, you cannot hope to contact the Premaswaruupa (embodiment of Love), the 
Lord. Just as radio waves carry the sound of the programmes everywhere through the ether, even 
the voices of hatred, envy, malice, scandal and faction foul the space around the world, as much 
as voices of love, compassion, sympathy, appreciation and admiration fill it with harmony. It is 
the duty of everyone to keep the atmosphere clean and healthy, by means of good thoughts and 
good words. A person who does not possess this elementary equipment for liberation is like a 
wheel without a hub, whey without butter, the night-sky without the moon, or a grahini (house- 
wife) without the sindhura (vermilion) mark. 


To confer on Man this Jnaana, God in His Infinite Mercy comes down as man, or else, man will 
degrade himself to the level of beasts. Unless he learns to surrender his ego with full satisfaction, 
in complete sincerity, with no reservations, to the Lord, he cannot realise Him, though He is 
resident in his own heart. The anguish that fills the penitent seeker will move the Lord to 
manifest Himself. In the ecstasy of that moment, man will experience: I am Thou, Thou art I. It 
is not a remarkable achievement to earn two meals a day and have a roof over the head. 


Make the mind an instrument for liberation 


The wheels revolve till the end of time. But, the real victory on which one can be congratulated 
is the victory over the six demons that have encamped in the mind of man, lust, anger, greed, 
attachment, pride and malice. When you do good deeds, keep good company, immerse your 
minds in good thoughts, these demons cannot survive in you. 


Vyaasa grouped the Vedhas into four. The flower of the Vedhic Tree is Vedhaantha (the 
concluding essence) and its Fruit is Aanandha-phala. To recognise that fruit, to crave for its taste 
and to discover the means of winning it, the mind has to be trained and disciplined. The mind is 
an extrovert instrument; when it flees into the mesh of the outer world, do not accompany it, let it 
go alone. Watch it struggling and suffering. Do not attach yourselves to it. Then, it will surely 
come back, chastened and cleansed. 


This spiritual discipline will certainly control the mind and make it an instrument, not for 
bondage, but, for liberation. 


Vairaagyam (detachment), Bhakthi (devotion and surrender) and Jnaanam (realisation of the 
Supreme Reality) to which they lead---these three are represented by the Thrishula in Shiva's 
Hands. Develop Jnaanam through the stages of Vairaagyam and Bhakthi, then, you can yourself 
be identified as Shiva-swaruupam. The mind has to be melted out of shape in the Fire of Jnaana 
(Jnaanaagni dagdha karmaanam), in order to manifest Shiva thathwa (essential nature of Shiva). 
That was what Raamakrishna accomplished at Dakshineshwar. He transformed himself into a 
brilliant gem by intensive process of Saadhana. Raidas became immortal, for, he used to ply his 
awl while stitching chappals, repeating at every stitch the Name of Lord Krishna. 


Man must merge his will with Divine Will 


Muscular power, mechanical power, political power, military power, scientific power---all are 
futile when weighed with the power of Grace. Do not ask for futile gifts. Ask that Grace to give 
you what He knows you most need. Leave the nature of the gift to Him; it may be good fortune 
or bad; it may be pain or joy; it may be dishonour or defeat. Leave it to Him; He knows best. 
Dedicate yourself to Him. That is the meaning of the Lord's injunction in the Geetha: Maamekam 
sharanam vraja. Surrendering to His Will is the only duty you need accomplish, the only task 
you have to carry out. If you do that, He assures you that no harm shall approach you."Maa 
suuchah--do not grieve; He says. 


This does not mean that God is anxious that mankind should fall at His Feet; man should cleanse 
his mind; he must worship the Grand and the Glorious, the Supreme and the Universal; he must 
merge his will with the Divine Will, which is what is meant by surrender. That Universal 
Grandeur is Naaraayana; Vyaasa revealed the Naaraayanathathwam in all its Glory through his 
Bhaagavatha and so the world must be ever grateful to him. 


Choose, not Kaama but Raama, the Aathmaaraama; meditate on that and draw bliss therefrom. 
Or, practise meditation according to a fixed time-table, until you overcome the need to remember 
the time-table, until you are not even conscious that you are engaged in meditation. Or, recite the 
Gaayathri or some such significant manthra with attention to its meaning and value. Or, dwell 
on the Name, with all its attendant aura of glory. The sound of the syllables has a curative 
restorative property. That is why the formulae have been laid down by the Sages. 


Detachment alone can ensure joy 


Or, you can dedicate your talents and acquisition to the service of man, of man as the visible 
embodiment of God. Whenever you are serving another and relieving his distress, remember it is 
your own distress that you are relieving. A cow was caught in a bog and it was floundering 
helplessly. A throng of idlers was watching its struggles with great relish. A Sanyaasin (monk) 
passing along the road saw the unfortunate animal; he removed his shin. He threw away his head 
cover; he jumped into the slush, and lifted the cow on to the bank, in spite of its kicks and frantic 
movements. The throng laughed at his bravado and weight-lifting prowess and some one asked 
him, "Why could you not go your way, unconcerned?" 


The Sanyaasin replied, 'The picture of that cow's agony cut into my heart; I could not go one step 
further. I had to get rid of the pain in my heart. This was the cure for that pain. I did it to save 
myself, not so much to save the cow." You serve yourself; you harm yourself, when you gloat on 
the harm you have inflicted on another. There is no ANOTHER! Only those who have reached 
that stage of spiritual progress have a right to advise on service. 


You believe that God guards the good from harm and inflicts on the bad, that is not correct. The 
goodness of the good guards them; the badness of the bad injures them. God is the Witness. 


The heart of man must be transformed into a cool soft pleasing instrument, as cool and soft and 
pleasing as moonlight; that is why the Full Moon Day is set aside for offering gratitude to 
Vyaasa, who communicated to man the key of this process, the process of controlling the 
vagaries of the mind by devotion, dedication, and concentration on the magnificence of the All- 
pervasive, All-knowing God. 


If you have attachment to sense-objects (Raaga) you can never be free from disease (Roga). 
Thyaaga (renunciation, detachment) alone can ensure true bhoga (joy, bliss). This does not mean 


that you can flee from the world; you can never do that. The world will always be with you. 
While in this world of A-shaanthi (turmoil and agitation) you must win Pra-shaanthi (the highest 
type of equanimity). To help you in this process, and to make you aware of the distance you have 
traversed, tests may be held by the Lord; you must welcome them, as chances to demonstrate 
your accomplishments and to win credit and appreciation. Do not develop contrary reactions. 
Students should ask for tests, so that they can estimate the heights they have scaled; they should 
not protest or run away. 


On the foundation of Faith, erect the four pillars of Sathya, Dharma, Shaanthi and Prema and 
upon them, raise the Mansion of your earthly Life. That is the richest property you can earn here. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 23.5.1967 


23. Lead or Gold 


WHEN the Unmanifested Shakthi manifests in an individualised Form, it is a source of 
Aanandha for those who recognise it as such, as you heard just now, from the experience of Dr. 
Tiberg, who has come from America. She has studied the ancient Shaasthras of India and has 
spent many years in this country; she knows that the mission of man is to realise himself as 
Divine and merge in the ocean of Divine Bliss. Jnaana is the treasure that man has to 
accumulate, so that he can so realise and merge. Cows may be of different breeds, or colours or 
sizes; but, the milk they yield is the same, the world over. So too, all religions, whatever their 
origin or extent of influence, are all means to teach man this process. 


Now, the law of human behaviour has become "each for himself;" this is because the fact that all 
are "one-in-God" is not known and realised. This is the product of Saadhana; the conviction is of 
slow growth, but it has to be acquired. Dhurvaasa, the great sage who is famous in the epics for 
his asceticism, is also known for his anger when he is slighted or thwarted by others. He was so 
sensitive, so egoistic, so uppish, that he forgot the unity of all-in-God. He was ready with a 
frightful curse when any one showed disregard for his inflated ego. Of what avail are all the 
years of austerity? Surrender all you have and gain, to Lord. Sometimes, when you have some 
extra cash with you, you hand it over to a trusted friend, saying, "Keep this for me; I am afraid I 
may spend it soon if it is in my hands; I cannot trust myself." God is the friend on whom you can 
put your trust. So, hand over to Him all that you have---and be free and happy. You do not do it 
now, since faith is wanting. 


Happiness of material origin is short-lived 


Man still believes that Aanandha can be got from the external world. He hoards wealth, 
authority, fame and learning, in order to acquire happiness. But he finds that they are fraught 
with fear, anxiety and pain. The millionaire is beset by the tax-gatherer, the cheat, the donation 
hunter, the house-breaker, and his sons and kinsmen who clamour for their share. Happiness of 
material origin is short-lived and has misery as its obverse. 


Struggle to realise the Aathma, to visualise God; even failure in this struggle is nobler than 
success in other worldly attempts. The buffalo has horns; the elephant has tusks. But what a 
difference. To live in the body, with the body, for the body is the life of a worm; to live in the 
body, with God, for God, is the life of man. The dull, activity-hating Thaamasik persons cling to 
the ego and to kith and kin; their love is limited to these. The Raajasik (active, passionate) 
persons seek to earn power and prestige, and love only those who will contribute to these. 


But the Saathwik (the pure, the good, the equanimity-filled), love all as embodiments of God and 
engage themselves in humble service. Pundaleeka was one such. He was massaging the feet of 
his old mother when God appeared before him! He did not interrupt the service, for he was 
serving the same God, in his mother! Thukaaraam declared to Pundaleeka that it was God who 
had manifested before him; but Pundaleeka did not waver. He asked God: to wait for a while, 
until he had finished the service of the God he had started serving. 


Proceed from the known to the unknown 


The prompting inside man to love his mother is an expression of the Divine Nature in him. If 
there was no spark of the Divine in man, he would not have loved at all. A person who loves is a 
theist, whether he goes to a temple or church, or not. Pundaleeka was not guilty of sacrilege, for 


he was actually worshipping God in His most accessible Form---his mother. You have to 
proceed from the known to the unknown. Then the love expands in ever widening circles, until it 
covers all nature, until even plucking a leaf from a tree affects you so painful that you dare not 
injure it. The green vitality of the tree is a sign of the Divine Will, which sends its roots deep into 
the soil. The roots keep the tree safe from storms, holding it fast against the violent tug of the 
wind. So too, if the roots of love in man go down into the spring of the Divine in him, no storm 
of suffering can shake him and crash him into disbelief. 


As a lump of sugar sweetens every drop of water in the cup, the eye of love makes every person 
in the world friendly and attractive. The simple milkmaids of Gokul saw each other as Krishna; 
such was their overwhelming love for the Divine Incarnation. The Bhaagavatha, where their 
Love and the Love of many other seekers of the Lord are described, is a text-book of Divine 
Love, Bhakthi. The Mahaabhaaratha, which describes the exploits and excellences of Krishna, is 
a text-book of Dharma, of the ethics of social and political life, as corrected and straightened by 
the supremacy of the Right. Begin loving service, this day this moment. Each act will urge you to 
the next, for the thrill is so inspiring. 


The best service and the best time to render it 


There was a king once, who questioned many a scholar and sage who came to his court, "Which 
is the best service and which is the best time to render it?" He could not get a satisfying answer 
from them. One day while pursuing the forces of a rival king, he got separated from his troops, in 
the thick jungle; he rode a long way, exhausted and hungry, until he reached a hermitage. There 
was an old monk who received him kindly and offered him a welcome cup of cool water. After a 
little rest the king asked his host the question that was tormenting his brain: "Which is the best 
service?" The hermit said, "Giving a thirsty man a cup of water." "And, which is the best time to 
render it?" The answer was, "When he comes far and lonely, looking for some place where he 
can get it.” 


The act of service is not to be judged, according to the cost or publicity it entails; it may be only 
the offering of a cup of water in the depth of a jungle. But the need of the recipient, the mood of 
the person who offers---these decide whether the act is gold or lead. 


Fill every act of yours with Love. Let no one suffer the slightest pain as a result of your thought, 
word or deed. Let this be your Saadhana. It will surely help you to achieve the Goal. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 24-5-1967 


24. The One in all 


FROM time immemorial, scriptures and the experience of saints and seekers have agreed in 
declaring that there is One Supreme Indweller in all beings, and only One. All efforts to 
distinguish between the devotee, the object of devotion and the means of devotion have 
concluded, at this point only. Prahlaadha, the greatest devotee of that Supreme Godhead has 
declared in the Bhaagavatha, "Why doubt and discuss whether He is here or there? Seek Him 
anywhere and you can see Him there itself." He is near and far, before, behind, beside and inside 
everything in the known and unknown worlds. People dare describe Him as thus and thus; that 
reveals only their faculty to guess; no description can exhaust Him or delineate Him, in full. 
Such description is based on their experience of the transitory outer world and will surely be 
affected when direct realisation is won of the Highest Bliss. 


It is beyond the reach of human intelligence or imagination to realise the Full and the Eternal; in 
proportion to the development of the faculty, man seeks to picture the Vast Magnificence and 
locate it in Ayodhya or Dwaaraka or some such spot and give It a Name and a Form, so that he 
can approach It and adore It. He might even revere It as Full, but, how can a fraction be Full? 
How can a facet be the entire Diamond? 


All Names and Forms are of the many-faceted One 


Consider each fraction as a value, as valid; do not deride it as incomplete. It is impossible to 
experience the Complete and communicate the experience. Fractions too are facts. They share 
the splendour and glory; they are sustained by the same spring. When the Full is seen as a part, 
the Fullness does not suffer dimunition. Raama, Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva---these are Names and 
Forms of the many-faceted One; when you pay attention to one facet, the rest are not neglected 
or negated. When the devotee dives into the flood of Bliss that the one Name-Form confers, he is 
diving into the same Ocean of Bliss that the Full IS. The waters of the Ocean are not separated 
by lines drawn on them to demarcate this God's region or that God's. Plunge anywhere; you are 
plunging into the self-same Bliss. 


All this variety is the play of Name and Form; without the multiplicity of names to distinguish 
one from the rest and the vast phantasmagoria of form to identify and cognise, knowledge of the 
many is impossible; then, all will be seen and felt and experienced as One, which it really is. To 
remind man of this fundamental Unity so that he may not get lost in the conflicts and 
complexities of manifoldness, the One assumes Name-Form and comes as Avathaara (Divinity 
incarnated in human form) among men. Then man is drawn towards the Avathaara by means of 
Grace and Prema, and led into the path that will give him the vision of the Full, the One. The 
One can best be defined as Prema, Love; for, all Nature is immersed in Love, all beings are 
bound by Love, all are drawn by Love. Love is in all, Love is of all. Love is all. 


As affection, sympathy, attachment, fraternity, loyalty, reverence, adoration, patriotism, Love 
expresses itself in many directions. Adhwaitha (non-dualism) proclaims that! this One is 
inseparable and unique; Dhwaitha (dualism) emphasises the excellence of Its Names and Forms; 
Visishtaadhwaitha (qualified dualism) speaks of the Names and Forms as integral parts of the 
One. All reveal Its Glory. 


Individual and the Universal are ultimately One 


Adoration, Puuja, is the way of approach, to reach the One and submerge oneself in Its Glory. 


Adoration arises when awareness of the glory is effected; then, it is a continuous process, called 
Saadhana. In the beginning, the Adored and the Adorer are different and distant, but, later, they 
commingle and come to be more and more composite. For, the Individual and the Universal are 
ultimately One. The wave must yearn only for losing itself in the sea, it should not have any 
lesser wish, any other aim. Merging gives full content. The ego will be dissolved; all signs and 
symbols of particularism like name, form, caste, colour, creed, nationality, church, sect and the 
fights and duties attendant thereon, will fade. 


For such liberated individuals who have merged their ego, the only task that will adhere will be 
the uplift of humanity, the welfare of the world. Their stage of Bliss will react on the world 
beneficially, without any conscious effort on their part. They have been rendered Amrutha- 
swaruupa and so, they are embodiments of the sweetest Aanandha; Endeavour to reach that Goal 
and do that Seva, to the world. 


Baaba's Message to Divyajeevana Sangha, June 1967 


25. Three-in-one now 


THIS Day is a sacred day, when devotees dwell upon the majesty and splendour of the Lord, and 
taste the sweetness of His Name, which is so dear to them, because it holds within itself the 
entire Bhaagavatha. The Avathaar of Krishna was a full incarnation, with all the sixteen facets of 
glory. In the Avathaar of Raama, out of the sixteen, the three brothers had one each and 
Parashuraama, the contemporary, had one, until Raama met Him and overpowered Him and 
drew within himself the fraction of the Divine power that He had. Other incarnations were for ad 
hoc purposes, the suppression of evil represented by one evil person or group of persons. The 
Raama and Krishna Avathaars were, however, for more general purposes, the mission of 
restoring Dharma and fostering virtuous living, besides punishing the wicked and teaching the 
world that vice will not succeed. Man is an amalgam of humanity, animality and Divinity. It is a 
tragedy if he cannot get rid of the animality; it is a greater tragedy if he Cannot cultivate his 
Divinity. Contemplation of the Raama and Krishna Avathaars and their /edas (Divine plays) and 
mahimas (miracle powers) is the surest method of cultivating the Divine in man. 


Before every incarnation, two collaborators for the task on which the incarnation comes, also 
appear--the Maayaashakthi (deluding power) and Yogashakthi (power of comunion with the 
Divine). Maaya comes as the elder sister to warn the wicked; Yoga comes as the elder brother, to 
enthuse and keep constant company. Maayaa thrust Kamsa deeper and deeper into perdition, so 
that his downfall will be more terrible and educative. But, in this Kali age, the wicked have to be 
reformed and reconstructed, through love and compassion. That is why this avathaar has come 
unarmed. It has come with the message of love. The only weapon which can transform the vile 
and the vicious is the Name of the Lord uttered with Love. 


The great lesson of Kaalinga episode for man 


The Name is redolent with Divine Glory; so when it is turned over in the mind it transmutes it 
into an instrument for liberation from delusion. Take the name, Navaneethachora (Butter-thief) 
that is used for Krishna. It does not mean a person who runs away with the butter that people 
have stored. It is not the stuff called butter, that is got by churning curdled milk, that He stole. It 
is the butter of Faith, won by the churning process called 'yearning,' from the curdled milk called, 
‘worldly experiences.' He covets only this ‘butter.’ When Yasodha chided the child Krishna for 
this 'theft,' He replied, " But Mother, they like me for stealing it; they are sorry if I do not; they 
churn it not; they churn it in the hope that I will steal it; when I steal, their hearts are illumined 
and they awake." 


Among all the wondrous adventures that astounded people during His childhood, which revealed 
to them the Divinity that had come among them, the Kaalinga episode is most meaningful. The 
serpent Kaalinga was poisoning the waters of the Yamuna and the atmosphere over it, with its 
breath; all who approached that area, men or cattle, fell dead. But, Krishna, the Divine Boy, 
jumped into the depths, forced the foul snake to rise above the level of the river, and leaping on 
its rapid range of hoods, He danced upon them with His tender lotus feet. The pressure of those 
soft silken soles was enough to force the deadly poison out from the fangs of the monstrous 
cobra and render it harmless for ever. 


Allow the Divine in you to Lord over the mind 


This is a great lesson for man. This /ee/a is quite unlike earlier incidents which evidenced the 
Child's super-human strength and wisdom. He was lifted away by the storm-demon, he was hit 


by the calf-demon, he was felled by the cart-demon, he was pecked at by the stork-demon, he 
was poisoned by the nurse-demon; but sceptics can easily ascribe these miracles to accident or 
coincidence or exaggeration. But, the Kaalinga episode is a valuable lesson in spiritual 
saadhana. 


In the Maanasa-sarovar (the deep placid mind-lake) of every man, there lurks a poisonous cobra, 
with six hoods---lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride and hate---infesting the air and destroying 
all who near it. The name of the Lord, when it dives into the depths, forces it to come up to the 
surface, so that it may be destroyed. So allow the Divine in you, the Krishna, to Lord over the 
mind; let Him trample on the hissing hoods, and tame the vicious vipe; let it vomit the venom, 
become Saathwik (pious) and sweet. This is the saadhana the episode teaches, the duty it 
enjoins. 


Like all avathaars, Krishna announced His advent to the world, bit by bit, step by step, testing 
every time how far the Reality will be accepted by the masses. The signs and miracles were 
intended, then as now, to proclaim the Avathaar. Even while in the cradle, Yasodha had a 
surprise from the child one day. She was singing lullabies and relating stories to send the child to 
sleep. One day, she told the Raamaayana story---how Dhasharatha had four sons, how the eldest 
son, Raama, grew; how Raama was about to be enthroned as Crown Prince; how his step-mother 
persuaded his father to send him as an exile into forest for fourteen years; how a golden deer 
appeared before his dearly beloved wife; how he pursued wicked Raavana who had played this 
trick to get Raama out of the way, came to the hermitage at that time and carried her away to his 
island kingdom! As she said this, the child seemed to be terribly angry. It held forth Its hand, and 
cried, "Lakshman! Give Me My bow and arrow." The mother remembered that Lakshmana was 
the brother who accompanied Raama to the forest and she was convinced that He who was 
Raama had come as Krishna to the world again. 


Krishna's revelation of His Incarnation 


Chaithanya also gave indications of His being an incarnation to His mother, as a child. 
Chaithanya was then a baby crawling on all fours. His mother had a guest in the house, an old 
orthodox Brahmin, who was cooking his own lunch, from the provisions given by her. He 
desired his food to be ceremonially pure, uncontaminated by the touch of other hands. He offered 
to God the food he proposed to eat; that was his vow. It was rather late when the offering 


was ready. Just when the he sat before the idol of Krishna for worship, the child toddled forward 
and dipped his fingers in the vessel of food thus making it 'impure' as an offering to God. So, 
provisions were given again, food was cooked again, and very late in the day, the worship was 
resumed. This time, too, the child crawled in from somewhere and contaminated the sacred food! 
It repeated the mischief a third time. The mother dragged the child away and threatened to thrash 
the prank out of its head. But the child asked the mother, quite innocently, "He is calling on me 
to eat it, but, when I go near him, he gets angry." Thus did He reveal that He was Krishna come 
again. 


All Avathaars teach, as the first step in the long road of Saadhana, the giving up of attachment. 
In the Threthaayuga, the Yoga-Vaasistha taught the same rule. In the Dwaparayuga, Krishna 
taught Arjuna to give up Vishaya-Vaasana (attachment to the objective world). 


There was an ascetic once, who had given up all attachment. He was going along a Himaalayan 
track, when the wind blew his hair on his face and blocked his vision. So, he turned and walked 


in the opposite direction. He was not attached to any direction or place! 


People utter, with apparent faith, "Krishna-Krishna-Krishna," but they never give up thrishna 
(thirst) for worldly good or fame. In each Yuga, you have the Avathaar of the Lord come to 
redeem, revive and re-build. At the present time, Mahaashakthi (Super Power), Maayaashakthi 
(Power of Illusion) and Yogashakthi (Power of Vision with God) have come, all together, in one 
Human Form; your endeavour should be to draw near and earn Grace therefrom. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, Krishna Janmaashtami, 28- 7-196 7 


26. The wheel and its hub 


BHAARATH is the sovereign of all nations, so far as spiritual dominion is concerned; and which 
dominion can be richer than that? She alone is capable of scattering the clouds of doubt, anxiety 
and fear that darken the minds of men and turn them to competitive adventures in the realm of 
material gain and glory. These clouds have appeared over the Indian sky also; people here too 
are admiring darkness and slighting daylight. They blindly imitate the manners and morals of the 
West and open the doors of their hearts to the flood of greed and discontent. Of course, the 
material world which science analyses and studies, and provides the means to control and 
regulate, is necessary for fulfilling the demands of living, but, it is wrong to imagine that world 
can give us lasting peace or joy. 


The Vedhas and Shaasthras of India were not collected or compiled by fools or knaves, they 
were put together by people, who gave up the attractions of comfortable life, as so many heroes 
of scientific discovery like Edison do now: they retired into the forests, so that they could 
concentrate on the solution of the problems that challenged them. In every statement in the 
Vedhas and Shaasthras, you get the genuine ring of actual experience and personal thrill. 


Do not sit on the bank of the river and pronounce judgements of the depth of the waters, or their 
taste to potability. Step down and examine for yourselves; that is the sign of the sincere seeker of 
Truth. If you do not, you can be rejected as a prejudiced or perverse witness. Those who 
pronounce My act of creating Vibhuuthi (holy ash) as 'magic' are also of the same category, for 
they talk without any qualification. They cannot tolerate the splendour of the Divine to disturb 
the darkness they have learnt to like. The impact of material civilisation has hardened their 
hearts, softened their brains, and made their lives hollow and vain. 


Search for comfort will make a man egoistic 


The rulers who frame and foster the educational system of the country are responsible for the 
discontent, disillusionment and consequent delinquencies and disturbances of the students. They 
pay attention only to the physical and intellectual training of the youth; they forget the attention 
must also be paid to mental, moral and spiritual development, so that an integrated personality 
can emerge. Now, a child is put to school so that years later he may get a cushy job! Schooling is 
for gaining a living, not for gaining the ultimate in life. In all countries, it is the same. 


Nowhere is youth trained to earn Shaanthi (equanimity, peace); everywhere, the aim is a 
comfortable life, not a life of peace and undisturbed joy. Comfort is a passing phase; it is a 
relative stage, between two discomforts. The search for comfort, for riches, for fame, for power 
over others---these will make a man so egoistic that he is a danger to himself and others. The 
only safe path is to seek Aanandha within oneself, not in or through others. There is great joy 
awaiting the person who radiates compassion, truth and patience, humility, reverence and piety. 


Mind soaked in desire Cannot receive wisdom 


Students must demand a revision of the system on these lines; they must demand that they be 
equipped better to meet the challenge of life. They must convince the administrators that this is 
essential. After all, they are your own people, interested in your welfare. They must listen and 
carry out suggestions. Zoroaster, one day, asked the Prince of Iran, "Go, light this lamp, from 
yonder flame." The lamp could not be lit; for the wick was soaked in water. Then Zoroaster said, 
"Your mind is so soaked in desire that it cannot receive the wisdom it needs; dry it in the sun of 


detachment." When teachers and the taught are immersed in worldly desire, how can light be 
transmitted or kept alive? 


There was a mother-in-law once, who declared with evident satisfaction, "My daughter-in-law 
passed away, no doubt, but, what a wonder, the terrible fever she was suffering from disappeared 
in a trice." The fever is not the prime thing; her life is the crucial object to be cared for. So too, 
the student should know how to live a contented, peaceful, happy life; that is more important 
than a degree or a class in examination. The journey into the inner consciousness to calm the 
storms that rage there is more important than the journey to the Moon or Mars. The latter may be 
more spectacular, but, the former is the more beneficial. Life without goodness, good thoughts, 
good actions, good words, is like sky in the night, without the moon or stars. It is like a wheel 
without hub or spokes! No one can push a boulder away while standing on it; you cannot be free 
from anxiety, while all the entrances through which it sneaks in are open. Stop catering to the 
senses, and feeding the desires that haunt you. 


Let the name of the Ananthapur Engineering College reverberate all over the country, as 
indicating an earnest desire to serve others, as suggestive of sweet talk, and sweeter hearts. I am 
always happy among students, especially when they are full of love and joy, high ideals and 
heroic determination. I had met the students of the Kaakinaada Engineering College, while this 
same Principal was working there. They did fine voluntary services for the meetings there, which 
attracted lakhs of people from all over the area. I am happy that this College too has the same 
tradition of intense study, combined with excellent social service. 


Ananthapur Engineering College, 30-7-1967 


The genuine outer signs of bhakthi are three: faith, humility and 
apprehension. Faith in the ultimate victory of truth and love; 
humility before elders and the wise; apprehension in the presence 
of evil, fear to mix with bad company to enter into evil designs, to 
act counter to the whisperings of conscience. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


27. Sweetness invisible 


MAN alone has the chance to liberate himself from the wheel of birth and death, through the 
most pleasant means, that of serving God. But, as a result of ignorance or what is worse, 
perversity, he lets the opportunity slip from his hands, and suffers grief and pain, fear and 
anxiety, ad infiniturn. By escaping from the clutches of the fascination exercised by material 
objects and physical pleasures, man can succeed in his efforts to liberate himself. He has 
travelled long enough on the wrong road; it is time now to turn back and move steadily towards 
the goal. The love that he has cultivated for men and things has to be sublimated into pure, divine 
worship. Then it gets transmuted as Bhakthi (Love of God). Convince yourself that the Lord is in 
you, as the charioteer, holding the reins of the five horses (the senses) and giving you constant 
counsel, as He did when Arjuna prayed to Him, to lead and guide. Then, it becomes easy for you 
to convince yourself that the self-same charioteer is leading and guiding all other men and even 
all other beings. When you are established in this faith firmly, you become free of hate and 
malice, greed and envy, anger and attachment. 


Pray to the Lord to strengthen this conviction and this faith; He will open your eyes to the Truth 
and reveal to you that He is the Sanaathana Saarathi, in all. That revelation will confer on you 
incomparable Aanandha, and grant you kinship with Creation's manifoldness. That is the reason 
why Krishna told Duryodhana, who pleaded with Him for help against the Paandavas, on the eve 
of the battle, "If you hate the Paandavas, you are hating Me, for, they have recognised Me as the 
Breath of their Life." Know Him as your strength, your breath, your intelligence, your joy--He 
becomes all that and more. No more can any faculty of yours hinder your progress. He will direct 
all of them towards the highest Goal; the senses, the mind, the subconscious, the unconscious, 
the intelligence--all. Grace will confer all you need. 


Seek Grace, it confers all else 


A mother-in-law was complaining against the new daughter-in-law that she consumed stealthily 
quantities of milk, curds, cream, butter and ghee. The girl's brother who heard this story from the 
lips of the old lady, called her into the presence, and after reprimanding her for her malfeasance, 
advised her to give up stealing all the items, except milk. "Milk, you can drink any, quantity you 
like; but, why steal these other by-products?" The mother-in-law, it is needless to say, was not 
very pleased with advice! So, seek Grace, that is enough; it confers all else. 


You must cultivate love towards every one, however distinct the character and capacity of each 
may be. Though the same blood flows through the entire body, the eye cannot smell, the ear 
cannot taste, the nose cannot see, do not over-emphasise the distinctions and quarrel. Emphasise 
the basic brotherhood and love. As sugar that has dissolved in the cup of water is invisible, but 
patent to the tongue in every drop, so too the Divine is invisible but immanent; capable of being 
experienced, in every individual, whether he is at bottom or on top. Do Naamasmarana (repeated 
remembrance of the Lord); taste the sweetness that is in the heart of every one; dwell on His 
Glory, His Compassion, which those names summarise. Then, it will be easier for you to 
visualise Him in all, to love Him in all, to adore Him in all. 


Prashaanthi Vidwanmahaasabha, Ananthapur, 31-7-1967 


If you talk of anything you do not know, it is a matter for ridicule. 
If you talk about anything you have not experienced, it is 
reprehensible, for you are cheating your listeners. If you learn the 
art of public speaking and talk enchantingly using all the skills and 
frills recommended in the text-books or borrowed from others, it is 
cheating, nevertheless. Be sincere; be simple, be honest. That is the 
best recipe for successful speaking. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


28. Roots into the deep 


GOD is Premaswaruupa; God is in every being; so, the fruit of every life is full of the sweetness 
of that Prema. Like the bitter skin of the fruit which is sweet which casts the cover of ignorance 
over the precious juice within, so too the bitter skin of envy, egoism, hate, malice, greed, lust and 
pomp does not allow the sweetness to be patent to all. Every being is entitled to partake of that 
Prema, irrespective of nationality, colour, creed or status in society. When God and God's Prema 
are activating every atom, who dare say, 'Stand out' to any one? [shaavaasyamidham sarvam--- 
All this is God, is Prema. 


The lights that Vyaasa lit to reveal this great reality have become dim; no one is pouring oil into 
the lamp; all are interested in pursuing false ideals and fleeting pleasures. Vyaasa taught Dharma 
in the Mahaabhaaratha, bhakthi in the Bhaagavatha, and shaanthi and prema in the 18 Puraanas; 
he taught the knowledge of "knowledge, knower and the known" in the Brahmasuuthra. He 
emphasised that harming others is the seed of sin and serving others the seed of merit. That is the 
lesson of Prema, pure and simple. The person who has delved into his depths and discovered his 
inner reality is the embodiment of shaanthi. 


Realise troubles and miscries are God's gifts 


Prema is the Amritharasa (essence of nectar) which fills the Upanishadhs. When man realises 
the inefficiency of the senses, the mind and the intellect, to grapple with the Reality and know 
the inner core of his truth, then, he discovers he is the Aathma which is Sathya, Dharma, 
Shaanthi and Prema. Or, He realises that there is God who is the basis of all this superstructure, 
who has designed and contrived all this and he surrenders his ego to Him. "Let Your will 
prevail," he proclaims and resigns himself fully to His plan. That moment is a supreme moment 
of joy, Aanandha. Troubles, miseries, handicaps, grief and pains that were hitherto causes of 
distress suddenly take on a new and magnificent r0le: they are "His handwork, His gifts, His 
Grace." They are no longer unwelcome; they are as welcome as the successes, the pleasures, the 
happiness are. Both are His Will. When you go to a new place, you seek out a friend and hand 
over to him all the money you have for safe keeping; but, if you start suspecting him later, you 
will have no peace. Have faith in him; you are free; you have no worry. So too, give all your 
desire-driven activities to God; have faith in Him and be unconcemed for ever. Sarva dharmaan 
parithyajya, (giving up all your desire-driven activities through various codes and regulations) 
maam ekam sharanam vraja (give everything to Me and have full faith in Me). 


If the match-stick is soaked in water, how can it ignite when struck? If the mind is soaked in 
vishaya (worldly desires), how can it be ignited into spiritual endeavour? The Prema with which 
you are endowed must be directed towards God; then only can it expand, grow, deepen, fertilise 
all your actions, benefit all those around you. If it is confined to the world, it will be sucked up 
soon, by the sands of envy greed and malice. Without that expansive Prema which is Divine, 
man is worse that a pashu (animal), he is a Danava (demon). The pashu or cow yields milk, 
when its dead calf is stuffed and taken near its udder. That is the measure of its vaathsalya 
(parental love)! 


Human life today is like a wheel without hub 


The light of Prema is absent in the heart; and, so, bats and nocturnal birds infest it and foul it. 
The bats are the evil qualities of hate and malice and greed. The Mahaabhaaratha epic which 
Vyaasa collected and composed teach quite emphatically and clearly the evanescence of wealth, 


authority, power, physical prowess and all that is considered desirable by man on earth. What did 
Duryodhana and Karna lack? Still, they fell and were eaten by dogs and jackals on the battlefield 
on which they had staked their all. 


It is to develop this Prema and use it for liberation that the four ideals have been placed before 
man---ideals which he is to strive for consistently, each one being sublimated and subordinated 
to the next---Dharma, 


Artha, Kaama, Moksha---Artha or material happiness to be won by Dharma (virtuous living), 
Moksha (Liberation) to be held as the only desirable Kaama or goal. Now, these ideals are being 
repeated ad nauseum but no attempt is made to act. That is why human life everywhere has 
degenerated into a farce, a tragedy. It is like a wheel without a hub, milk without butter, 
ineffective, waste. 


Prema too is of three kinds, depending on the guna (quality) that predominates in the individual. 
Thaamasik Prema confines itself to "me" and "mine," it does not flow beyond that little circle. 
The Raajasik Prema flows only towards those in power, or have wealth, or to those who will: 
give it a spectacular effect. Saathwik Prema, on the other hand, always flows towards the good, 
the pure, the detached, towards awe and wonder, towards God. Pundaleeka was tending his 
parents when God appeared before him as Naaraayana. He was revering them as the God in 
them. So, he asked Naaraayana to wait a little, He threw a brick towards Him to serve as a 
footstool on which He could stand, until he was ready to worship Him. If you do not revere the 
parents, how can you draw from your heart enough reverence to worship the Father who dwells 
in Heaven? 


A cleansed mind alone can recognise God 


Prema is the spring that feeds the roots of all the virtues. You must have seen paddy fields where 
the crop is drying, though the ground is wet and there is a thin sheet of water still under the 
plants. You must have seen also big trees, standing upon hard dry ground, but, decked with a rich 
crown of green foliage. Have you paused to find out the reason for this contrast? The roots of the 
paddy plants do not go deep; the roots of the trees go down unto the very springs of underground 
water which are perennial. 


So too when each of your acts, the words that you utter, the thoughts that shape your desires and 
emotions---when all these draw sustenance from the roots that go deep into the inner springs of 
Love, then you will be happy and fresh, you can give shelter and shade to many a weary mortal. 
Japam and thapas (pious repetition of Lord's Name and penance) and puuja and vrathams (ritual 
worship and vow-keeping austerities)---all train and subdue the senses. They cleanse the mind so 
that God can be reflected therein. Just as the sugar that your eyes can see and your hands can put 
into water becomes so dissolved in it that neither eye nor hand can cognise it again, the senses 
and intelligence cannot cognise that immanent God; chiththashuddhi (cleansing of mind) alone 
can recognise God, just as the tongue alone can recognise the sugar that has dissolved in the 
water. 


Gopikas had the highest form of devotion 


The Gopikas had .that chiththashuddhi (purity of thought), though inferior minds full of gross 
desires have fouled the clear springs of their Prema with their ignorant comments. Naaradha too 
thought that the illiterate milkmaids could not have the highest form of devotion; but, when he 
offered to teach them, he found them so immersed in God-consciousness that they had no 


thought other than those of Krishna, no words unrelated to His Glory, no act unconnected with 
His Seva. They had surrendered their all to the Lord who ruled them from within themselves. 


It has become a fashion for the educated to ask, "Where is God?" "What is His task?" and not 
wait for answers. They can well believe that there must be some one who launches and regulates 
the highly complicated rockets that move around the earth and other artificial things in space; 
but, they cannot believe that there must be some intelligence behind all this manifold galaxy of 
stars and planets revolving for aeons and along millions of light years of space. 


Believe in that Supreme Paramaathma and engage yourselves in the practice of living. You will 
then find that you can manage to detach yourselves from the world, though you are in it. You 
will be like the lotus which grows in water but which floats on it and does not allow it to wet it, 
like the tongue which is unaffected by grease though it may eat ghee and oily articles. The 
chiththa (the mind-stuff) should not be contaminated by contact with the sensory objects, that is 
the means of saadhana. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, Guru Poornima Day, July 1967 


A man being dragged to court by the police, pleaded with friends 
to come to his rescue, but one refused to move out of his house, 
another offered to accompany only upto the court-hall, but a third 
promised to be with him through thick and thin. When man dies, 
his wealth refuses to move out of his house, his relatives go upto 
the cremation ground but the reputation he has earned goes with 
him even beyond that. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


29. The mind principle 


MAN must rise beyond the animal and master his monkey mind. This is the most important item 
in saadhana. This technique was elaborated in the ancient Vedhic texts and practised by the 
sages; neglect of the study and practice of the Upanishadhs (Vedhic philosophy) and the Geetha 
has resulted in the crisis we suffer today. 


So, attempts should be made to revive our ancient culture, which was so practical, so applicable 
to our everyday problems and so beneficial. Now, there are many details about the mind that 
have to be remembered and many misconceptions that have to be ignored. What exactly are we 
doing with our minds? In how many different ways are we harmed by the activities of the mind? 
How does that mind itself get modified and transformed? One has to study these and free oneself 
from the sovereignty of the mind. One should endeavour, on the other hand, to establish one's 
sovereignty over the mind. Then alone is this life worth while. Else, it is a colossal waste. 


Grasp this maaya and in an instant, the postulate of mind is seen as illusion. You can know the 'T' 
principle. When this "I" is not cognised, how can you answer the query, "Who are you?" You are 
not the name or label fixed on your material body---Yellappa, Raamappa, Mallappa, or 
Lakshmanappa. You are not the bodies which your parents named so. Your genuine name is 
different. You declare, 'This is my leg, my head, my stomach;" but who is this 'I' that possesses 
these? Discover who this 'T' is; understand that the 'I' is not the body. When this is realised as a 
true fact, it follows that 'T' is not the sense, nor the mind. So, the 'l' is the resident of this body, 
whose residence gives all these their validity and value. That is to say, 'l' is the breath. 


Illusion is the effect of the mind 


So long as breath resides, there is no death. So long as there is current flowing, the bulb 
illumines. When the current does not flow there is no light. You attach importance to the coming 
and going of the light in the bulb; you do not observe that the current is ever flowing. The 
connection is broken, that is all. The body is a bulb; when the current flows through it, the parts 
inside it are activated and function effectively. The breath is the current; the breath is 'T'. The 
Vedhas rely on three categories: Direct, Indirect, Inferential; but, there is a fourth also: Shabdha, 
the Sound, the authenticity of the Sound. The breath is inhaled, retained and exhaled as the 
sound: Soham Soham, Soham. This means: I am Brahman, I am Brahman.' So, you are not a 
jeeva (individual soul)or a deha (body), you are Brahman---the Universal, Eternal, Unchanging. 
The illusion you are now hugging that you, with this reality of Brahman as your core and 
substance, are only this particular body bearing this particular name---this is what is referred to 
as Maayaa (worldly illusion). That is the effect of the mind. The mind has no special 
individuality; it has no innate, inherent capability. All its powers of mischief are activated and 
multiplied by man himself. It is agitated by the winds of delusion that blow on it. 


Now, here is a piece of cloth, though it is just an assortment of yarn. Some yarns are in this 
direction and some are in the other direction, and so the cloth was created. If we pull out the 
yarns one by one, there will remain nothing of the cloth. So too, the desires of man are the warp 
and the woof that has woven this new thing called 'mind'. Remove desire; the mind disappears 
and is no more. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, October 1967 


The Shaasthras give facsimiles of what the genuine is, just like the 
printed reproductions of new issues of currency notes, which are 
published for the information and guidance of the public. You 
cannot cut out that bit of paper and use it to buy things. You can 
only use it as a standard and say that if the note used is different, it 
is counterfeit. So also, the Shaasthras lay down the standards; 
what is un-Shaasthric is counterfeit conduct. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


30. The tiger in the ring 


NAVARAATHRI is celebrated in honour of the victory that the Paraa-Shakthi (the Goddess of 
Energy, immanent in the Microcosm and the Macrocosm) achieved over the Asura or Evil 
Forces, as described in the Devi Mahaathmyam and Devi Bhaagavatham. The Paraa-Shakthi is 
in every one as the Kundalini Sakthi (dormant spiritual energy), which is able to destroy when 
awakened, the evil tendencies inside the mind; so, the Navaraathri is to be dedicated by all for 
the propitiation of the outer as well as inner Divinity, in order that the outer and the inner worlds 
may have peace and joy. By means of systematic Saadhana it is possible to tap the inner 
resources that God has endowed man with and elevate yourselves to the purer and happier realm 
of the Reality. 


Look at the trainers of wild beasts. They bring the tiger, the most ferocious of animals, like a cat 
into the circus ring, and make it jump through a hoop of fire or lap milk from a plate, face to face 
with a goat, sitting on a chair! They are able to subdue its ferocity and tame it, reduce it to the 
position of an unassuming toy! How could they do it? They did Saadhana, they made the tiger 
also go through a regimen of Saadhana and they succeeded! If you could succeed with the tiger, 
can you not succeed with the ferocious denizens of your mind? 


Three aspects of Shakthi 


You can. That is the message of Navaraathri, the Nine Days' Festival celebrating the victory of 
the Primal Energy. That energy, when it is manifested in its Saathwik (quiet) aspect is delineated 
as the Great Teacher and Inspirer, Mahaa-Saraswathi; when it is Raajasik (active and potent), 
the great Provider and Sustainer, Mahaalakshmi; when it is Thaamasik (dull and inactive), but, 
latent and apparently quiet as the Great Dark Destroyer and Deluder, Mahaa-kaali. Since Shakthi 
is all-pervasive, omnipotent, infinitesimal as well as all-comprehensive, it can be contacted 
everywhere, in outer nature or inner consciousness. Prahlaadha told his doubting father: "Why 
doubt, discuss and delay? Seek it anywhere; you can see It." It is near and far, before, behind, 
beside and inside everything, in the known and the unknown world. 


People dare describe Her or Him, as thus and thus; that reveals only their faculty to guess. No 
description can picture the portrait in full. When direct realisation is won, the tongue is rendered 
dumb; the portrait is unlimnable. It is beyond the reach of human intelligence or imagination. 
But, man seeks to picture the vast magnificance within a limited frame and locate it in Ayodhya 
or Dhwaaraka or Madurai or Kanyaakumari or some such spot, and give it a Name and a Form, 
so that he can approach It and adore It. The Name and Form identify It, they do not limit It. 
When you dive into the Sea at one place, you are diving into the Full, not a Fraction, for the 
ocean is the same everywhere. You cannot separate it into sections by drawing lines on it. Plunge 
any where; you are plunging into the self-same Bliss. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 4-10-196 7 


Man has to master two foes, Kaala (time) and Kaama (desire)--- 
the ravaging tactics of time and the undermining strategy of desire. 
He must not allow time to rob him of strength and vitality, too 
soon; he must not allow desire to lead him astray from the search 
for Shiva, who mastered both Kaala and Kaama. He subdued 


kaala or yama in the Markendeya episode; He burnt Kaama when 
he dared drawing Him into his bond

31. Moving Temples 


I AM talking to the men and women I choose to be volunteers, before every festival, and 
advising them about their duties and the spirit in which they should execute them. But, those who 
act according to that advice are very few! Each is engaged in his own selfish schemes! Each 
helps himself, and not those who need help. This badge is a sign to indicate that you are 
unselfish, that you are willing and eager to serve. It is no decoration or prize gift. To have this, 
and to wander about, lolling in the street, indulging in loose talk and evil habits is treason to 
those who expect to be helped by you; it is also sacrilege. You bow, fall at the feet, 
circumambulate the Prayer Hall, and perform all the exercises which proclaim that you are a 
Bhaktha (devotee possessing intense love to God); you declare before these very visitors that you 
are Bhakthas,; but, your behaviour gives you up; they reveal that you do not deserve the name. 


Sick people must be given immediate medical attention; old people must be seated in the shade; 
children must be fondled and consoled. Since there will be a gathering of many thousands for 
about twelve days and nights, some people interested in making quick money, by transferring to 
themselves the properties of others, may also be present. It is, of course, a sin, wherever it is 
done; here, in this atmosphere of Sathya, it becomes doubly so. So, the visitors who come have 
to be protected from their attentions; you have to be vigilant, discover such characters and 
prevent their manoeuvres. This badge is a call for help from the thousands of devotees who are 
coming here, in full faith, that they have the Lord to tend them. 


Serve people with no thought of high or low 


To be present here is itself a gift of Grace, won by accumulated merit; to be endowed with the 
badge is a rarer gift. Make the best of this grand chance. This badge is a 'sapling' that has broken 
through the soil, from the seed of merit that you have sown in the past. See that the sapling is 
watered and fostered by your honest Seva (service), not dried up in the dust of insincerity and 
hesitation. It provides you a valuable opportunity to cast off bad habits and assume good ones. 
You will have to discard self-conceit and the craving for display, so that you may win Grace. 
Serve people with no thought of high or low; no service is high, no service is low, each act of 
service is equal in the eye of the Lord; it is the readiness, the joy, the efficiency, the skill with 
which you rush to do it that matters. 


If you do not serve man, who is your kith and kin, with the same feelings, impulses and instincts 
as you, who is before you, alive and gladly accepting with a smile of gratitude, how can you 
serve Maadhava (God), who is so far above and beyond you, so different and distant, so potent 
and mysterious? Train yourselves to serve God by serving man, in whom there is God installed 
in the heart. Convince yourselves that the service of man is worship of God. If you send away 
some one who runs towards your house for shelter from the rain back into the open street, you 
are inhuman, to say the least; if you do not do all that lies within your power to alleviate the pain 
that you find another is suffering from, you are unfit to be called human. Be at least human, even 
if you do not aspire to become divine! Being human is at least better than the status of beasts, for 
they do not remember the past, nor plan for the future. Cattle do not know that they are 
ploughing for the sake of sowing, nor bringing home the harvest, when the mowing is finished. 
Man piles upon his head the past and the future, and since he is not quite sure, he goes to the 
additional bother of 'insurance!' Man is burdened with desires; he plans to brighten the future, 
and wipe out the past. The tiny seed of desire grows soon into a mighty tree; so you have to fry 
the seed in the fire of thapas (penance), so that it may not sprout. 


A volunteer is expected to be an example to all 


The fire of detachment will fry the seed of desire, down to the last trace of life in it. Mere 
transitory fits of renunciation will not succeed in preventing sprouting. Detachment has to be 
supplemented by the knowledge of the hollowness of the objective world. Else, humility and 
reverence are but clothes you put on, while wearing the badge. When you take leave and move 
out from the gates of Prashaanthi Nilayam, the clothes are changed and the old tatters of arrogant 
egoism are worn! When some one uses harsh words against you, do not allow your pride to 
persuade you to retaliate with harsh words of your own. When one of your fingers pricks your 
eye, you do not turn against it and retaliate, do you? The person who was harsh is as much you as 
your own finger. 


You tell people not to speak aloud, nor smoke. If, you yourself commit these lapses how can you 
insist on others to obey your instructions? Control these tendencies that you have developed; 
they are recent habits. If you do not master these little evils, how can you ever hope to suppress 
deeper evils, like greed, pride, hate, malice and other vicious tendencies? This badge is a sign of 
My Love, of My Compassion. It is an inspiration, a lesson, a blessing! It expects you to be 
virtuous, an example to all, in devotion and enthusiasm. 


It is an inspiration, not just for these ten or twelve days. Or, in this limited area, named 
Prashaanthi Nilayam. Wherever you are, at whatever time, do the duty that this badge demands, 
whether you have it on, or not. Help others as much as lies in your power; if you cannot give 
them adequately, at least, feel the agony. "Alas! How much is the suffering they undergo! Lord, 
relieve it soon," pray thus with all your heart. 


Shankaraachaarya used to live on alms. In the old days, Imperial Princes, who studied in the 
hermitages had to seek alms and live on what they collected thus. This is for the removal of silly 
egoism. As pilgrims yourselves to the holy temple of sath-karma (righteous action), keep away 
your luggage (egoism) and enter the shrine, to purify the heart. Deposit your luggage in the 
vaults of "surrender" (sharanaagathi). Remember the persons whom you serve are temples, 
where God is installed. Worship them with the flowers of good words, timely help, and vigilant 
care. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 4-10-196 7 


32. The miracle of love 


THE doctor who is presiding over this Hospital Day is known to Me for many years; he was 
coming to Shirdhi and is very much attached to Me, since the first day he came there. Though the 
Shirdhi body and this body are different, the dehi (the person in the body) is the same; and, so I 
recognise and reward all who come to either place. 


We have a Hospital here, since eleven years, with twelve beds for inpatients and doctors and 
nurses and equipment and medicines for treating them and a large number of out-patients. Do not 
be under the impression that we have this Hospital because I need the help of these doctors and 
these drugs to cure those who come to Me. There are some who desire treatment by the doctors, 
in a hospital; that is the means by which they feel they can be cured. Some are anxious that the 
doctor must give them an injection; if he doesn't, they feel they are neglected. So, I 


ask the doctor to give them one or even a series! There are many who have no faith in anything 
except tablets and the needle. They come to the Hospital and while there, they listen to the 
silence of the Prashaanthi Nilayam, and feel the Aanandha that is redolent in the atmosphere. 
They respond to the bhajans (congregational singing of devotional songs) and see how people 
who partake in it are happy: when they are in that Aarogya nilaya (House of Health, the 
Hospital), they are drawn to this Aanandha nilaya (Home of Bliss, the Prayer Hall), and 
gradually, they equip themselves with the armour of faith, which guards them against any illness. 


Today disease has its hold on every family 


There is another reason; many patients with illnesses of an advanced nature are brought here; 
they cannot be accommodated with others, in the sheds or rooms; they require close attention and 
loving care, special diet and facilities, which only a Hospital can provide. So they could be 
admitted into the Hospital awaiting My darshan and My ministration. They can be looked after 
better there than in the midst of the vast gathering of devotees. 


When two people meet, it is considered good manners that each should inquire about the health 
of the other. This is true of the peoples of both East and West. You ask each other, 'How do you 
do?' regardless of the fact, that both are every moment approaching death, nearer and nearer. 
Really speaking, both are undergoing kshaya (decline), not kshema (the security of health)! With 
each exhalation of breath, a fraction of life-span escapes from our hold. So, each should warn the 
sher, remind the other, instruct the other, to use the available present for realising the God within 
the Universe and within oneself. 


The body has to be maintained in good condition, for it is only when embodied in this human 
tabernacle that man can realise God. The body is either strong or weal an efficient instrument or 
an inefficient one, according to the food, recreations and habits of one's parents. Since the elders 
do not pay attention to these, the health of the children suffers; we have hospitals, dispensaries 
and clinics in every street now, because disease has its =hold on every family, in every home. 
Even little children wear glasses; young people dye their hair, many wear dentures. The reason 
is, the atmosphere in the modern home is filled with artificiality, anxiety, envy, discontent, 
empty boasting, vain pomp, extravagance, falsehood and hypocrisy. How can any one growing 
up in this corrosive atmosphere be free from illness? If the home is filled with the clean 
fragrance of contentment and peace, all its occupants will be happy and healthy. The elders have, 
therefore, a great responsibility towards the generation that is coming up. 


Conquer anger when it arises in the mind 


Anger is also a great cause of ill-health, besides being dangerous for other reasons. It brings a 
long trail of camp-followers, each of whom adds its share tO the final ruin. So, you must conquer 
this passion, when it arises in the mind, by reminding yourself of the omnipresence of God, of 
God as the inner motivator of all, of His being the Director of this Play called Life. Try to think 
of something else than the circumstances that roused your anger, do some Naamasmarana, lie 
down in bed, go on a long walk, drink some cold water---struggle with yourself, until you win. 
Do not fight with others; fight with your own urges. When the Chinese hordes poured in, you 
fought them on the Himalayas, not in Penukonda; isn't it? Penukonda may be more easily 
accessible, but, the invasion is on the border and the struggle has to be on the border! Stop the 
enemy at the threshold; stop anger at the threshold of the mind. Then, the body's safety can be 
ensured. 


Know the "sign which declares that I am Sai Baaba" 


The best preventive of ill-health is the Aanandha that comes of unconcern. Look at Me. I have 
come with this body, and you can see that there is no difference between this body and any other 
human body. But yet, illness has never affected this body. It cannot, any time. Even if I welcome 
it, it cannot approach Me. Nor am I taking any precautions against it. I take all manner of foods, 
at all kinds of places, in all types of homes. The dhobi's room will be full of varied assortments 
of clothes, isn't it? My dining table has an equally varied assortment of dishes, brought by 
devotees at the Nilayam belonging to all the comers of the world. I have no fixed menu at all; I 
do not care for one. I move about in all varieties of weather, sun or rain, summer or winter, 
valley or plateau; I drink water from one well today, another tomorrow. But, I am Aanandha- 
swaruupa (Divine Bliss personified) all the time and so, I am never ill. Nor am I in the least 
disturbed by either the praise or by the maligning, that people pour. When I am spoken of, either 
in derision or in adoration, My Aanandha is the same. A wayside tree having a load of fruits with 
sweet juice, is admired by some; but, most people are tempted to throw stones. Even lunatics and 
senile old men will cast stones at it. The tree will only be happy that it is receiving the penalties 
for its bounty, and contributing to the happiness of the hungry and thirsty. 


This Prema is My distinctive marl not the creation of material objects or of health and happiness, 
by sheer exercise of Will. You might consider what you call 'miracles' as the most direct sign of 
Divinity; but, the Prema that welcomes you all, that blesses all, that makes Me rush to the 
presence of the seekers, the suffering and the distressed in distant lands or wherever they are, that 
is the real sign! It is that which declares that I am Sai Baaba. 


For Me, every day is a Festival day, for My Prema is showered everyday! But since you pay 
attention to the calendar and observe specially these holy days, I also arrange these Festivals 
here. When the Doctors come and ask Me permission to have a Hospital Day I say, Yes. For that 
provides you a chance to know from Me the disciplines needed to keep this physical instrument 
healthy and active. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, Hospital Day, 5-10-1967 


The Shaasthras lay down steps in saadhana, so that man can have 
peace, contentment and joy. The very first step is to remove the 
weeds in the garden of your heart, plucking by the roots the briar 


and bush of lust and greed, of hate and pride and plant in the 
ground thus cleared the fragrant flower plants of prema (love) and 
the sweet fruit trees of dharma (virtue). 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


33. Books as benediction 


SIX books, in five languages, were dedicated to Me now, by the authors or publishers. So, this is 
an appropriate occasion to put the question to ourselves, "Why should books be written, 
published and read?" Books must reveal, inspire, educate, inform, lead and guide. Yes; but, what 
should they reveal? Whom should they inspire? How must they educate? What information 
should they contain? Where should they lead? To which place or stage must they guide the 
readers? These questions have to be answered before we can pronounce the book good, the 
trouble and expense worth while and the dedication well done. 


Those who believe that there is an all-knowing God who rules and regulates the Universe--- 
science has progressed from certainty to doubt, about its capacity to explain the Universe---have 
to admit that each one is born as a result of His Will. Therefore, there must be a Divine Purpose 
in life. Man must know the way to attain God, must be led and guided to attain Him, must be 
educated to rid himself of distractions on the path, must know that, which if known, all else is 
known. The rest is all secondary, incidental, unnecessary. The Vedhaantha, meaning "the goal or 
finale of the Vedhas," is the repository of this knowledge, the knowledge of God and of the 
journey which leads to Him. The different hypotheses about His Nature and characteristics and 
how to test their validity, the different disciplines that will render the intellect of man sharp 
enough to grasp the Glory of God, the immeasurable thrill that the revelation of the Glow of God 
as one's own inner glory will confer, all these are indicated in the Upanishadhs, which form the 
Vedhaantha. Every good book written by Man is acclaimed so because it has a vein of this 
golden glory in its pages. 


Spiritual knowledge alone can give peace and happiness 


Vedhaantha means the final product of the fund of knowledge---liberation. The final product of 
milk is ghee---for, when milk is heated, curdled, churned and the resultant butter is clarified, 
ghee is secured and it cannot be turned into anything else. That is the end-product. Vedhaantha is 
Jnaana---the knowledge that reveals, that loosens 'the knots of the heart' and the bondage to 
external objects, that discloses in a flash the Unity that is the Truth of all this multifarious 
Creation. That alone can give shaanthi and sukha (peace and happiness). Man can be happy only 
in vastness, in overflowing into greater and greater power and magnificence. People run up to 
Nainital or Kodaikanal or Mussorie during summer, in order to escape the heat of the plains. So 
too, people seek vastness, in order to escape the stuffiness of 'individualised' life. They want the 
Eternal, the Absolute; not, the temporary and the particular. So, books must deal with the eternal 
verities, the absolute certainties, the vast immeasurable joys. 


The fascination that the temporary has over the mind is called Maaya or Delusion. For example, 
under the delusion that white or greying hair is something to be ashamed of and postponed, men 
and women dye their hair---though for all other purposes, white is considered more desirable 
than black! The mind is never still fixed on any one ideal. It is ever wavering, flitting from one 
object to another, hopping from one satisfaction to another. To allow oneself to be led by the 
mind and bypass the intelligence is the folly called Maaya (illusion). The world is a labyrinth in 
which man has become entangled; he must find a way out. The mind, however is no guide, for it 
is an aimless wanderer. 


See God face to face in all beings 


The camel eats thorns and is happy. Man too suffers untold misery as a result of his search after 


objective pleasures; but he does not seek a way out. He is not aroused into activity to overcome 
the pain of the thorns in his mouth. The pain makes him resolve now and then to desist, but, that 
is but a momentary vow. There is no strength behind that resolution. When disgust develops into 
determination, the habit is terminated, the effects are washed off in the tears of repentance and 
the mind is eliminated. The Lord is ever behind you. Turn back from the world---He is face to 
face with you! Cultivate enough strength of mind to know its weakness and to surrender your all, 
to the God whom you see face to face in all beings and at all moments. 


He does not calculate the cost of the 'all' which you surrender at His feet. He examines the spirit 
in which it is surrendered. Shankaraachaarya stood before a house with his begging bowl. The 
old lady who lived there was struck by the effulgence on his face that betokened a realised soul; 
but she had nothing which she could drop in that bowl. She wrung her hands in despair; she 
cursed herself; she wondered why the distinguished mendicant had come to her door, instead of 
going to the doors of the affluent. Then she remembered she had a single myrobalan fruit, the 
last !of a handful she had plucked from a tree in the jungle a few days earlier. When she felt 
thirsty, she used to eat a fruit. She brought it out and, with tears flowing in her wrinkled cheeks, 
she dropped it into the bowl. Shankaraachaarya was touched by her contribution; the Lord 
willed; a shower of golden myrobalans fell in the yard in front of her hut. She was placed above 
want even without her asking for it. That is the way Grace works. 


The Lord is Love inexhaustible 


You know the various acts of Grace that Krishna conferred on the Paandavas; but, if you know 
how Krishna came first into the Paandava group, as friend, guide and saviour, you will realise 
that Grace is showered unasked by the Lord. Parikshith put this question to Sukha, the narrator of 
the Bhaagavatha episodes: "How did Krishna and His elder brother Balaraama first meet my 
ancestors?" Sukha said, 'Whey were present at the Swayamvara (choosing of husband by the 
bride herself) of Dhroupadhi, where the Paandavas were also present in the guise of Brahmins. 
You know that Dhroupadhi was to wed the archer who could successfully hit the revolving fish 
figure put on a tall post. When the men of the warrior caste failed in this test. Brahmins too were 
allowed to try their hand if they wished. Arjuna succeeded and won her hand for all the five 
brothers. They were living incognito in a potter's home. Krishna knew that the winners of this 
Royal Princess were His kinsmen and so, He went to the potter's hut with his brother. He 
announced Himself as Krishna and gave them very wise counsel about their future course of 
action." 


The Lord is Prema---Love-unsullied, inexhaustible, universal. He has no predilections or 
prejudices. You have no reason to fear Him; fear rather the tendencies in you that drag you into 
vice and sin. Books that prompt persons to love God and fear vice are most beneficial. Love 
towards God must be witnessed by love towards man, for man is the visible manifestation of 
God, a manifestation whose grief and pain you can understand as akin to your own. 


Such books can come only out of hearts that pine and pray. Lead that life and the lines will 
emerge. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 6-10-1967 


When you cultivate the attitude that you are the body, the body will 
demand from you more food, more variety in food, more attention 


to appearance and physical comfort. A large portion of the food 
now consumed is superfluous; man can live healthily on much less. 
A good deal of effort and expenditure now spent to cater to taste 
and to social pomp can be given up, and health too will improve 
thereby. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


34. Nurse the ancient tree 


INDIA is the land where the dichotomy of 'that' and 'this,' of 'Creator' and 'Creation,' of 'energy' 
and 'matter,' was resolved in one grand Unity, by both theory and practice, in philosophical 
schools and in hermitages. The Tree of life, with its countless branches proliferating into 
thoughts, words, and deeds, attitudes, tendencies, and impulses, is known by the sages of India to 
have its roots in Heaven! So, every rule and ritual was made sacred and holy, suffused with 
purity, humility and love. This resulted in peace and happiness, for the individual, the family, the 
community, the nation and the world. 


But on account of the domination of exotic ways of thinking, quite contrary to Indian ideals, 
people have become ashamed to call themselves Hindus, as if the picture the sages drew was a 
caricature; as if they were being misled by their ancestors. This is a wrong and dangerous 
attitude; it ignores the lasting benefits that one can draw from the experience of those sages. The 
attractions of a free and easy life are superficial and hollow. When the wicked Kauravas were 
undraping the clothes of Dhroupadhi, the Paandavas sat unmoved; for they felt bound by their 
plighted troth; but the Lord, who loved them for that loyalty, came to her rescue! Now too, the 
honour of Hindu religion and culture is at stake; it is being derided and discarded by the very 
people who have the responsibility to foster and fructify them. Hindus are fast giving up the rites 
and ceremonies that marked the different stages of spiritual development. They join in the 
humiliating laughter of cynics who proclaim that they circled in outer space and did not find God 
anywhere; as if the earth under their feet and Nature around them were not witnesses enough for 
His existence! 


India must nurse the tree of Dharma 


Indian thought affirms that T and 'He' are one; that all is integrated in the composite whole, true, 
good, and beautiful, through and through. Indian thinkers have reached the dizziest heights of 
speculation and the clearest depths of intuition; they have found that the experience of 
fundamental unity is not negated by most rigorous logic. Therefore, all other faiths are but facets 
of this supreme Truth, this sublime experience. And, each little duty cast upon man in the Hindu 
Code of Morals reflects this awareness of Unity. For example, it is laid down that when a person 
dines without first feeding the chance guest or the hungry man at his door, he is committing 
theft, eating a meal of sin, partaking a feast of foulness! 


Dhamayanthi, deserted by her husband Nala, in the darkness of the forest, could not sleep, for 
she was anxious about her lord's welfare. Just then, she heard a herd of elephants rushing 
through, trampling the groups of aborigines sleeping around her; her warning cry was unheeded; 
they slept too soundly to be awakened. So too, India, that is to say, Vedhamaatha (the mother 
who speaks with the voice of the Vedhas) has to warn the nations of the world, sleeping the sleep 
of sense-satiety, that wildness is rushing in to destroy them. This is the role of Bhaarath-,--to 
assert that God is a present and persistent factor in human life, in every atom, in the Universe and 
that God is Sath, Chith and Aanandha (Existense, Conciousness and Bliss Absolute). She must 
nurse the tree of Dharma and garner from it, for the welfare of the whole world, the fruits of 
Ahlaadha (spiritual exhilaration), Aanandha (bliss) and shaanthi (calm equipoise). 


The preservation and promotion of Hindu Dharma is the need of the times. People who practise 
its principles have to propagate them, by precept and example. In every one, there is the thirst for 
God; only many deny it on account of false pride, some on account of ignorance, some call it by 


some other name, worry, discontent or despair. Some have faith only in Love, some believe only 
in Truth, some swear that they care only for Goodness---but, all these do not know that they are 
referring to God alone by these names. They too are pilgrims to the same Sacred Shrine. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 7-10-196 7 


Man must reveal the divine qualities of love, humility, detachment 
and contentment. If he does not, he becomes worse than a beast 
and more deadly. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


35. The tricycle 


BIRTH is the consequence of Kaama (desire, lust): Death is the consequence of Kaala (Time, 
the lapse of Time). The God of Desire (Kaama) was reduced to ashes by Shiva; the God of Time 
is Kaala or Yama. He was subdued by Shiva. So, one has to surrender to Shiva (God) if one has 
to escape the consequences of these two frightfully fatal forces. If between Kaama and Kaala, 
you take refuge in Raama, then you can escape the rigour. For Raama is the Aathma and Aathma 
(self, infinite) has no Kaama and is unaffected by Kaala. 


Nature---both outer and inner---is ruled by the Sovereign Aathma, the Universal Soul, the 
Paramaathma. So, if you earn the Grace of the Paramaathma, Nature becomes your docile 
instrument. The body is nature; the vital air is Paramaathma. Living beings are pictures moving 
on the screen; the screen which is unaffected by the emotions, the raging fire or roaring floods 
that pass over it, is the Paramaathma. The worldly will be fascinated by the pictures, which 
through delusion, appear as if they are all real living incidents; the wise will concentrate on the 
screen, which is pure, white and clear. When water is poured into milk, it too takes on the nature 
of milk. Nature too appears to be capable of giving us stability, joy and peace; but, these are 
really the qualities of the Ultimate, the Paramaathma. Like the water mixed in milk, these 
qualities do not belong to Nature at all. 


The three paths to attain God have equal efficacy 


The Hamsa (a legendary swan) has the property of separating the milk from the water and 
drinking the milk only. So too, Paramahamsa (realised person, who has achieved Truth) can 
separate the Illusory from the Real and experience the Bliss, communicated only by the Truth. 
Raamakrishna was a Paramahamsa; he knew how to separate milk (Truth) from the water 
(untruth) added to it. When he was suffering from cancer of the throat, unable to swallow food, 
his disciples entreated him to pray to mother Kaali, that the cancer may be cured; they felt that 
Kaali will certainly answer the prayer if he but made it. But, Paramahamsa refused to ask any 
such boon from God. His attention could not be diverted to any such low desire. "Why pray? If it 
is Her will, it will happen; if not, that too is Her will," that was the reply. 


There is a great deal of useless discussion and controversy about the paths to attain God; some 
demarcate three paths, Bhakthi, Karma and Jnaana. But there need be no controversy on their 
relative efficacy. They are like the confluence of the three holy rivers at Prayaag, the Ganga, the 
Yamuna, and the unseen underground Saraswathi. Ganga is the Bhakthi-maarga (the Path of 
Devotion)---surrender, control of selfish, sensual pursuits; Yamuna is the Karma-maarga (Path 
of ritual and ceremonial worship, of dedicatory acts)---engaging in activities, irrespective of the 
benefits therefrom, doing all duties as worship, eliminating all attachment, all pride of I-am-the- 
doer type; Saraswathi is the Jnaana-maarga (the Path of Knowledge; of acquiring true 
awareness of the Reality)---cognising that ideas of bondage are all delusion that One is ever Free, 
devoid of change, full of Aanandha. The three Paths are like the wheels of a tricycle---the 
wooden push-cart, which children are given, to train them to take the first steps, while learning to 
walk. Bhakthi and Jnaana are two wheels in one line at the back and the forward one is Karma. 
The child learns the steps and walks towards the "City of Freedom from Fear and Illusion." 


Each step of the Saadhana has to be understood well 


Instead of relying upon mere enthusiasm to show the way, it is better that the spiritual aspirant 
receives guidance from a preceptor during the early stages. For, one has to observe the 


disciplines, with the awareness of their meaning. Dhyaana, Upaasana (worship), Pranava- 
recital---these are best done under proper guidance; mere text-books may lead the saadhaka 
(spiritual aspirant) into disappointment. The significance of each step has to be appreciated in 
order to ensure the co-operation of all the faculties of man in the effort and ensure success. Mere 
mechanical imitation or automatic repetition is of no value. 


Ask any one why green leaves are strung across the main entrance of the house; the reply will be, 
"It is the custom, since ages; every decent person does it." But, why? Few people know it; no one 
cares to know. 


In the years gone by, every village home was stocked full of paddy bags, and so, the rats too 
inevitably infested every home. In one such home, they were celebrating every Full Moon Day 
the rite called Sathyanaarayana Puuja. This required the collection of good quantity of milk and 
ghee, the previous night itself. The rats attracted cats and the cats often preferred milk and ghee 
to the rodent food they are accustomed to. So, the milk and ghee were carefully kept in places 
unreachable to the cats. But, during the celebrations on the sacred day, the milk and ghee had to 
be kept open and available for use in vessels around the shrine. That was the chance for the 
depredatory cat; so, the master of the house caught the cat by the neck and put it under a heavy 
basket, and placed a stone on it, so that it could not play any mischief with the holy offerings. 
This was done so consistently every Full Moon Day as a safety measure in one home that the 
children and grandchildren felt that, puwja or no puuja, no Full Moon Day should pass without a 
cat being imprisoned under a weighted basket! They started searching for a cat and bring it 
home, so that the 'ritual of the cat and basket’ could be observed without fail. 


Surrender to the Divine Will will elevate words and deeds 


The original meaning and purpose was lost during the passage of time and later generations were 
burdened with a belief that danger lurks if a cat is not dealt with, as their forefathers did! From 
being an insufferable nuisance, the cat rose to a new status of importance! This is blind imitation. 


The fundamental factor in spiritual life is the suppression of desire’ the surrender of the 
individual will to the Divine Will, which will elevate thoughts, words and deeds into acts of 
worship. When Raavana fell dead, his queen Mandodhari lamented over his body, "You 
conquered every enemy of yours, except your own lust! 


You were pious, you were learned, you subdued even the most powerful foes---but, you allowed 
yourself to be enslaved by desire. That brought about your downfall." The magnifying glass 
draws the rays of the sun on a single point and can set fire to paper or grass. So too, 
concentration of attention can destroy the seeds of wanton desire. That is way I advise a few 
minutes of Dhyaana every day, both in the early morning hours and in the evening, after dusk. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 8-10-1967 


The scriptures teach that life is unfortunately short. So, the Geetha 
advises man to appreciate three facts: (1) To be born as a human 
being is a precious opportunity; (2) To yearn to realise God is 
another precious piece of good luck;' (3) The greatest good fortune 
is the chance to be in the Presence of God, to be immersed in the 
service of God and to be engaged in fulfilling Divine commands. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


36. The windows of the mind 


WILL Power motivated by God is the active force available for your uplift. This is called 
Sankalpa Bala. Develop it by concentration and japa. The mind must be compelled to submit to 
the dictates of the will. Now, you are easily led astray by the vagaries of the mind. That is why, I 
say, WATCH! W is for watch your Words; A is for watch your Actions; T is for watch your 
Thoughts; C is for watch your Character; H is for watch your Heart. If the watch reminds you 
every second of the need to watch these five, you can be quite happy. 


The mind swings like a pendulum between one pleasant object and another. To stop the 
pendulum, the easiest means is to stop winding. That will put an end to the swing. So too, stop 
encouraging the mind by following its whims and fancies. When we beat another or cause harm 
to him, we justify it as only right and proper; when he beats us or harms us, we revolt and call it 
wrong and punishable. 


Everything is judged by us on the touchstone of the ego. The mind is a double-edged sword---it 
can save, but it can also bind. Yoga is the restraint of the waves natural to the mind. By learning 
and practising the disciplines of yama, niyama, aasana, pranaayama, prathyaahaara dharana, 
dhyaana and samaadhi (abstention from evil-doing, various observances, postures, control of 
breath, restraining the sense organs, concentration, meditation, absorption in the Aathma), the 
seeker can overcome and eliminate the mind. 


The Five Elements attract and affect the five senses 


When the mind is eliminated, the Reality will become patent! It is like the discovery of the lost 
"tenth man." Ten friends waded across a river in floods, and when they reached the bank 
opposite each one took a count and found only nine, for he did not count himself! So, they 
inferred that "the tenth man" was drowned and began lamenting his loss. Then, a passer-by came 
along and counted them; he found that all were there; the tenth man too was there; only 
ignorance had kept him unrecognised. This is the consequence of Illusion. Since you do not 
know the real nature of the Self or Aathma, you do not recognise the Self at all; when this 
knowledge is communicated by the Guru or scripture, the ignorance of the Self disappears. 


The senses are the prime motive forces for the mind and the illusion it suffers from. The Five 
Elements have each a characteristic that affects and attracts one of the five senses: Sound (Ether), 
which fascinates the mind through the ear; Touch (Air) which draws the mind to itself through 
the skin; Form (Fire) which manipulates the mind in its favour through the eye; Taste (Water), 
which enslaves the mind through the tongue and Smell (Earth), which attracts the mind through 
the nose. Contact with the external world is maintained by the senses for the sake of these 
experiences---which yield joy or grief. In order to escape being tossed about on the waves of joy 
and grief, one should cultivate unconcern (upeksha), an attitude of welcoming either, as a sign of 
Grace. Shri Raamakrishna said that if you must avoid the sticky fluid in the jack-fruit from 
contacting your fingers when you peel it, you have to apply a few drops of oil on them. So too, 
said he, "if you do not want the world and its reactions to stick to you, have a few drops of 
‘unconcern' applied On your mind." 


This unconcern leads to the deepest yearning for God. Chaithanya went to Brindaavan, where 
every particle of dust was sacred for him, since Krishna trod that soil centuries ago. He did not 
see or hear or touch or smell or taste anything except Krishna at Brindaavan. He was rendered so 
forgetful to the world around him that he ignored the demands of hunger, thirst and social 


etiquette. He yearned for the consecrated food that was offered to Krishna in the Temple. But, 
one night, the Lord appeared before him, and admonished him for entertaining that one desire 
too! When at last, he gave up that desire also and was overwhelmed with the thirst for Him and 
Him alone, Krishna manifested before him, from within him. The Divine Chaithanya 
(Consciousness) illuminated the Chaithanya in human form. 


Learn therefore the discipline that can make the mind settle on God only and never waver 
therefrom. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 9-10-1967 


37. Jumping to conclusions 


WITHOUT self-confidence no achievement is possible. If you have confidence in your strength 
and skill, you can draw upon the inner springs of courage and raise yourselves to a higher level 
of joy and peace. For, confidence in yourselves arises through the Aathma, which is your inner 
Reality. The Aathma is peace. It is joy, It is strength. It is wisdom. So, it is from the Aathma that 
you draw all these equipments for spiritual progress. There are two eight-syllabled axioms in the 
Geetha, which are the basic beliefs man must have' Shraddhavaan labhathe jnaanam (with Faith, 
wisdom is won) and Samsayaathma Vinasyathi (the doubter is destroyed). They are two 
embankments between which the river of life can flow, safe and steady, towards the Sea of 
Divine Grace. During the years of youth, the river is subject to sudden floods which may eat into 
the embankments and damage the region. So, special Care has to be taken to render them strong. 


The planners of this country's future are concentrating on the production of food, drinking water 
and housing---but happiness cannot come through these alone. When morality is laughed at, 
bhakthi is dreaded as a disease, cleverness is placed at a premium, and the individual is 
humiliated into an instrument to be manipulated and utilised by the State or some other collective 
authority, how can happiness be ensured? 


When our people worship ant-hills, trees, snakes, birds, lions and cows, cynics laugh, unaware of 
the deeper truth it reveals, namely, that God is immanent in all creation. So too, there is deeper 
significance for the rituals and ceremonies that have been recommended and observed in this 
land since ages; but now the husk alone remains and the kernel has gone through neglect. It is at 
such times that the need arises for the re-establishment on the old foundations of the 
superstructures of Morality and Religion. There can be no religion without moral purity. The two 
are inter-dependent. 


Do good when you feel like doing it, don't delay 


Your car is not meant to be kept as a show-piece in a glass garage. It is meant for the roads, for 
taking you fast and safe to the place where you want to go. So too, your body must serve the 
purpose of your journey. Journey to where? No, as it has been happening, to the cemetery. You 
have nobler things to do than merely die! You must know your own Reality before you die and 
merge in that supreme Joy. Eat just enough to keep the body in trim; use the body to discover 
this Reality, namely, God. Sanctify every moment of your sojourn here with pious deeds and 
sacred thoughts. When Karna was applying oil on his head, with a golden cup of oil held in his 
left hand, a Brahmin who passed by, held out his hand and asked that the cup be given 


to him. "Here. Take it," he said, and gave it to him, with the left hand. The Brahmin was 
annoyed, because no gift should be given or accepted with the left hand. But, Karna explained, "I 
am giving this to you the moment you asked, for, I do not know whether I will be so disposed 
when I change the cup from the left hand to the right. Pardon me." Do good when you feel like 
doing it; do not delay---that is the message of this story. 


Not to have a son is no spiritual disaster 


One common criticism of Hinduism is that it tolerates the worship of images. But the stone is not 
worshipped as stone; it is the symbol of the God that cannot be pictured in His abstract, 
attributeless, Nirguna (Formless) aspect. The idol is of great help in concentration, as was proved 
by Raamakrishna Paramahamsa, Meera, Thyaagaraaja and a large number of other seekers. 


Meera derived supreme satisfaction when she experienced the Divine in the form of Giddhara 
Gopaala, the Cowherd Boy Krishna, who raised the Govardhana Peak as an umbrella to protect 
the people and cattle of Gokul against the ravaging rains sent down by the angry Rain-God, 
Indhra. Each mystic has a special Form which touches the deepest chords of the devotee's heart 
and moves him into the Divine Ecstasy. Thyaagaraaja knew that Raama was the Sovereign of all 
Creation, that He was immanent as well as transcendent; and he drew the highest inspiration by 
picturing Him as the son of Dhasharatha and consort of Seetha. 


Another Hindu belief is that food, when it is offered to God and then taken as consecrated by His 
acceptance, is activated by Divine energy and is freed from all evil influences that might adhere 
to it. This helps the attitude of dedication, and encourages the conviction of the constant 
Presence of God as an inseparable guide and guardian wherever you may be. This betel box that 
I have is made of lead; now, if some one comes and asks, "Keep the box, but give me the lead," it 
is absurd because they are inseparable, indivisible. So too, it is absurd to say, "Be a Hindu, but 
give up these beliefs, this Dharma." They are the very characteristics of the faith. If the Dharma 
is not known and practised, the Hindu is as bad as dead. 


Mention was made here of the fear that the childless suffer from; the fear is that unless you have 
a son, who will do the rites prescribed for the departed, the dead parents will have to sperm ages 
in a special section of hell! This emphasis on begetting a son was made only for royal dynasties. 
Since, in the absence of direct successors, the kingdom will have to pass through strife and 
bloodshed. Dhritharaashtra had a hundred sons; not one of them survived him and performed the 
rites to save him from hell! Suka, the incomparable Sage, had no sons; can you say that he 
missed Moksha (Liberation) as a punishment and spent ages in hell? Not to have a son is no 
spiritual disaster, I assure you. 


Do not be diverted by persons with perverse minds 


Look at another absurdity. Some worship God as Shiva and call Him as Pashupathi (Guardian of 
cattle), ‘pashu' meaning living beings, the bound; some worship God as Vishnu or Krishna and 
call Him as Gopaala (Protector of cattle), ‘go’ meaning living beings, the bound. And these two 
sets of devotees refuse to revere each other! Shiva is extolled as the Creator, Preserver and 
Destroyer, by those who adore Him. Vishnu or Krishna is extolled as all these three by these that 
adore Him; but, they don't take the next step of recognising that there cannot be any legitimate 
reason for their differences. You must welcome all Names and Forms, though you might have a 
personal attachment to one Name and one Form. You have to admit that the God whom you 
adore is universal enough to have many Names and many Forms. 


When a lone dog gets frightened by the shadow that moves ominously in the misty moonlight, it 
sets up a howl, which is echoed by all the dogs in the vicinity. Not knowing the reason, all howl 
in unison; it is sheer canine nature. The moonlight of Divine Grace stirs some humans also to 
howl and others to join in blind imitation. It is their nature; they cannot tolerate the 
Immeasurable Glory that showers Grace and Faith, courage and consolation. Your duty is to 
march ahead, straight and steady, towards the Goal, without being diverted by the exhibition of 
self-imposed ignorance and perversity. Every Avathaar had such pitiable contemporaries. You 
must have read of Sishupaala, Poundraka, Danthavakra and others, in the Dwaapara Yuga. 


Enslave yourself to God, not to man 


Maintain your self-respect as Dhroupadhi did. When she was about to be humiliated in the open 


court, where her husbands who had staked her and lost her in dice-play to the wicked Kauravas 
were present, she was so enraged that if she had only cast a look on the gang of ruffians who had 
won her and dragged her thither, they would have collapsed into heaps of ash; instead, she 
looked at Dharmaraaja, the eldest husband who had staked her and who was sitting before her 
with downcast eyes. That look quietened her a little. Then, she uttered a curse, which echoed 
over the earth and heaven. "May the wives of these vipers who laid their hands on my hair and 
dragged me here, lament their widowhood, waving their loosened hair, in unconsolable grief. 
Until then, I shall not plait the hair which these barbarians have unloosened now." She 
proclaimed, in the hearing of all, her lineage, and its reputation for self-respect and her resolve 
not to tarnish it or demean it. Maintain the dignity of your lineage, the lineage of Raama, 
Krishna, Harishchandra, Meera, Thyaagaraaja, Thukaaraam, Raamakrishna and Nandanaar. The 
glory of your lineage is like a carefully rolled ball of thread. Any slip on your part will result in 
its disastrous entanglement. So beware! Enslave yourself to God and not to man. Hold fast to 
your Saadhana. 


Be unmoved either by adulation or denigration 


Repeat the Gaayathri - it is a universal prayer. It has three parts, dhyaana---meditation on the 
Glory of God as the Illumination immanent in the worlds, upper, middle and lower (Om Bhuh- 
bhuva-swah; thath savithur varenyam),; it has Smarana or picturisation of the Grace (bhargo 
devasya dheemahi) and Praarthana, prayer for compassion for the sake of liberation, through the 
awakening of Intelligence that pervades the entire Universe, not to any particular Name or Form 
of that Intelligence; and so, all can use it and be saved by it. There can be no fanaticism, no 
hatred, no rivalry, if the Gaayathri is adhered to; its japa (pious repetition) will clarify the 
passions and promote Love. Do not water and feed the tree of desire. Intolerance is the product 
of anger, hate and envy. Try your best to suppress the first appearance of anger. It does not come 
upon you unawares. The body becomes warm, the lips twitch, the eyes redden---so, when you 
get the intimation, drink a cup of cold water, sip it slowly, close the door and lie in bed, until the 
seizure passes away, and you laugh at your own folly. This may appear difficult, but you have to 
practise it. For the consequences of your yielding to anger will be so disastrous that you will 
have to repent long for them. 


There was a father-in-law, who was so angry with the son-in-law for not writing letter to him and 
his daughter from foreign lands where he had gone as a soldier, that he wrote to him an angry 
letter: “You are as bad as dead, so far as we are concerned, for you do not care for your wife any 
longer. So she has shaved her head and started wearing widow's weeds." The soldier when he 
received this letter lamented aloud that his wife had become a widow, not realising that so long 
as he was alive, that calamity cannot happen! 


Do not jump to conclusions, abdicating your discrimination. Don't deny the validity of your own 
experience. Stand on your strength. Be unmoved, either by adulation or denigration. Follow My 
lead: I am unaffected by either, I march on, alone, undeterred and of My own accord. I am My 
own Guide and Witness, have full faith in this. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 13-10-1967 


God is no partial benefactor; he gives the fruit from every tree, 
according to the seed. you have planted the sour mango, hoping to 


use the fruit for pickles; then, why lament that the fruit is not sweet 
to the tongue? Do good and aspire to get the fruit of goodness--- 
that is pardonable. It is not as bad as doing bad and blaming God 
that He has given you the meed for evil deeds. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


38. Not above, but around 


NO other human community has gone so deep into the problem of birth and death, of thoughts 
after death and the continuity of the consequences of thoughts, words and deeds, as the Hindus. 
The solutions they discovered and verified are so universal, so convincing and so beneficial for 
individual and social uplift, that they have stood the test of centuries of critical assessment by 
scholars and sages of all lands. One commendable feature of this investigation is that reason has 
never taken a second place. At every step, the saadhana is to be reinforced by reason. The 
saadhana (spiritual discipline) is the drug, the intelligent appraisal of the results and difficulties is 
the regimen. The disease o£ Ajnaana (spiritual ignorance) is cured by the 'tablet,' Prajnaana 
(science of the spirit); that is to say, the damaging consequence of Ignorance is cured by the 
Higher Knowledge. 


But spiritual progress is not merely an intellectual exercise. It is right living, good conduct, moral 
behaviour. These attitudes are the automatic consequences of belief in a good, just, 
compassionate God, Who is watching and witnessing every act. So, faith in an Omnipresent, 
Omniscient, Omnipotent God is the first pre-requisite of a good life. 


All impulses sprout from within the mind 


Start the practice of goodness with the mother and the father. Serve them, please them, bring 
honour to their memory, become worthy of their gratitude. Expand the love and the service until 
you bring within its horizon all living beings, for all are altars of the self-same God; He is 
described in the Vedhas having a 'thousand heads.' So do not adhere to the 'aloners' in religion, 
who say the 'He alone is God'; change over to the ‘also-ers' who know that 'He also is God.' 
Every head before Me, all the fifteen thousand, is My Head; for, it is the head of God, as 
mentioned in the Vedhas. Every bulb is illuminated by the same inner-flowing current. Let not 
the bulb think that it is shining through its own will; let it be humble that it is but an instrument, 
used by the current, to shed light. 


If each one follows his own nose, there will be chaos. If each one decides to pursue his own wish 
or even his own reason (for after all, reason may be used to justify one's own predilections and 
pet prejudices), man will descend to the level of the apes or worse. So, man has to be guided by 
the wisdom of the past, the bounds prescribed by his well-wishers, the sages, the Shaasthras or 
moral codes laid down to map the conscience in him. The Shaasthras only channelise the urges 
that arise within men. Like the seed, which can sprout into a plant only from under the soil, all 
the various emotions, feelings and impulses sprout only from within the mind of man. If the 
mind is steady, nothing can shake you into indecision or indifference. 


When Thukaaraam came out of his hermitage, one morning, for Suryvanamaskaar (ceremonial 
prostrations before the rising Sun), his eyes fell upon the palanquin, orchestra, and the royal 
paraphernalia that Shivaji had sent to take him to his court. He told the messengers of the 
emperor, "Why have you brought this hearse? No one is dead here. I can still walk. Tell the 
Emperor that the need is not yet." 


The Lord is neither up nor down, He is within Faith in God must induce you to run and fall at the 
Feet of the Lord, irrespective of what others might say or even what might happen to you. Look 
at the moth; it sees the flame; it is drawn irresistibly by the inner urge to escape from darkness; 
thamaso maa jyothirgamaya; it dashes into the flame and dies. Look at the bee; it discovers the 
nectar in the lotus; it settles and sips in untainted bliss; it is unaware of anything else; the sun 


sets, the petals close, the bee is imprisoned, though it does not know it. It dies before the lotus 
blooms again with the dawn. But, the lives of both moth and bee are -fully worthwhile. For, this 
is the merging of Jeeva and Brahmam. 


The Jeeva struggling to merge with Brahmam wails plaintively, as the pilgrim to Thirupathi 
wails, "O, Lord! You are atop the Seven Hills, I am on the plains below." Therefore, it is said, 
the Jeevi must either rise up to that level or he must, by his prayers, persuade the Lord to come 
down to him and bless him, by His Presence. This is a wrong inference. The Lord is neither up 
nor down. He is within, not seen because the heart is unclean. Engage in Karma, until this 
cleansing is accomplished; then, when the Lord in you is cognised, all your acts will promote the 
welfare of the world. 


Some people say that they will believe in God only when they are afforded some experience of 
Divine Will. How can faith arise in the Will for those with such an attitude? They have no 
keenness to experience; how can examples help? Of course, if some have no faith, the loss is 
theirs. The Lord is unconcerned. Two and two make four even if some swear that they will not 
believe it. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 14-10-1967 


Be devoted to Me and receive power from Me. To the extent to 
which you enthusiastically quicken up this process of give and 
take, to that extent you will be successful and happy. Deliver all 
your anxieties, troubles, travails and desire, to Me and in return 
receive joy, peace and strength of mind from Me. During this 
Advent, only spiritual aspirants and righteous persons are 
relatives, friends and recipients of My Grace. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


39. The wet wick 


THERE is a law of cause and effect; every karma has a consequence, whether you like it or not, 
whether you anticipate it or not. A good karma produces a good result; a bad one has to produce 
a bad result. Birth is the result of the karma done before death; if you are asked what happens to 
man after death, you can point to yourselves and declare, "This is what happens"; they are born 
again. This is no religion of despair; it is a religion of hope, of assurance, of encouragement to 
lead an active, useful, beneficent life. For the future is in your hands; tomorrow can be shaped by 
today, though today has already been shaped by yesterday. That is the reason why the biggest 
section of the Vedhas is called 'Karma Kaanda' and deals with various types of Karma, calculated 
to induce detachment, to canalise the desire towards eternal and universal ends, to transmute all 
acts into acts of worship, to offer adoration to the Devas who preside over every force of Nature, 
every energy of man, every limb of his anatomy. 


The gross leads one on to the subtle 


Elaborate rituals were prescribed so that this inner yearning and outward purity may be firmly 
established. In the constellation called Saptha-rishi-mandala (the Great Bear), the star Vasishta, 
has very near it, a faint little star called Arundhathi. Vasishta and Arundhathi are the ideal 
couple. The two are inseparable even in the sky, always at the same degree of proximity. 
Therefore, the newly married pray to them for blessing them with long years of happy 
companionship. The star Arundhathi is pointed out to the bride by the groom as the model of 
constancy. 


In order that they may identify it, they have first to note the Mandala (region), then the Vasistha 
star and then fix their eyes on the Arundhathi star. The concrete is a pointer to the abstract; the 
gross leads one on to the subtle; the ritual guides one to the right: the sacrifice or Yajna 
reveals the Indweller. The Thaittireeya Upanishadh takes the student from the gross to the 
subtle, step by step, in its effort to teach him the Divine Principle. When Bhrigu, the son of 
Varuna, approached his father, saying, "Teach me Brahman," he was told in a general way, 
"Brahman is that from which all this originates, that in which they live, and that in which they 
enter when they depart," and he was asked to investigate it through meditation himself. 
Bhrigu declared that 'Food was Brahman,' and when asked to proceed with the investigation, he 
proceeded to the next hypothesis, that Brahman was Praana (life); later, he found that Manas 
(will, sankalpa, ichchaashakthi) was Brahman; then he reached the stage when he could declare 
that Brahman was Vijaana (intelligence); the next step was reached when he identified Brahman 
with Aanandha (bliss); thus the Upanishadh teaches the subtle, supreme, non-dual Bliss, hidden 
in the cave of the heart. From the material to the spiritual---that is the process of Upanishadhic 
teachings. 


The new born baby does ‘kevvu' (onomotopoeic word in Thelugu for baby's wail); the dying 
person, as a result of his experience of life, must do ‘navvu' (laugh, in Thelugu). The baby wails, 
since it does not know its name, its Reality; the dying man must laugh, since he should know it. 
He must die happy that his life-work has been accomplished. Koham? (whom am I)---the 
question with which he emerged into this world has been answered; he knows: Soham (I am He). 
He is born ignorant; he dies a jnaani (possessing spiritual knowledge). 


Faith will grow only through good company 
In order to acquire this knowledge, a pupil approached a Guru. The Guru asked him about the 


books he had studied. The young man replied, he had learnt the Geetha so well that he could 
recite it upside down. Then the Guru told him, "I do not believe I can help you. For, you have no 
faith Geetha, the word of God; how then can I expect you to have faith in my word',' Read the 
Geetha, with faith, with intent to benefit by practising the teaching. Otherwise, it is sacrilege to 
handle the sacred message of God in a light-hearted manner. Faith can grow only if care is taken 
not to fall into evil company. Sath-sangathwe nissangathwam---through good company, acquire 
the capacity to be alone with yourself; that is the advice of Shankaraachaarya. 


Once there was a hunter who had captured a baby bear and who brought it up as his pet with 
great love and care. The bear too reciprocated his love and behaved like a good friend for many 
years. One day, when he was traversing the jungle with his pet, who had grown up into a hefty 
beast, he felt overcome by sleep; so he laid himself down on the grass, asking the bear to see that 
he is not disturbed. The bear kept watch very vigilantly. It noticed a fly that flew round and 
round and settled on the nose of the master. The fly went off when it waved its thick heavy hand; 
but, it came again, and settled on the nose. The bear got enraged when repeated waves of the 
hand did not teach the fly that his master's nose was not the fly's resting place. At last, the bear 
could not bear the insolence any longer! His heavy palm came down with a thump on the nose, a 
devastating whack! The master died on the spot! That is the consequence of keeping company 
with the wild and the foolish. However affectionate they are, their ignorance will land you into 
disaster. 


Among the Parsis, there is a story about a Guru and a pupil. The pupil prayed that he may be 
given some advice to make the pilgrimage to God easier and faster. The Guru sat silent for a 
while and then told him, "Go. Light that Lamp." The pupil tried his best, but he could not light it. 
It was filled with water, not oil. So, the Guru asked him to pour the water out squeeze the water 
from the wick, dry the wick, wipe the lamp clean, fill it with oil and then light it. The water is 
'desire,' the Sun that can dry the wick is 'renunciation' and the flame of the lamp is 'Wisdom.' The 
Guru said, "This teaching is enough for you. You can go; may God bless you." 


Fill your mind with the desire to see God, be with Him, praise Him, glorify Him, and taste the 
Glow of His Majesty. There is no bliss higher than that. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 15-10-1967 


40. Seva as saadhana 


THE Vedhaantha declares that the mind (Manas) leads man, either into the cage of bondage or 
into the vast open spaces of liberation. If it involves itself in sensual pursuits, it drags man down 
into the sub-human level; if it engages itself in seeking the higher truths, the deeper realities, the 
more lasting joys, then, it enables man to rise to the level of the Divine. Science deals with 
matter, jada (things), as distinct from the living, the chith (Conscious), having Chaithanya 
(Supreme Spirit). Those are the provinces of religion, of spiritual saadhana and yoga applied to 
mind control. This is the age of scientific advancement, when equal attention is not being paid to 
spiritual advancement, or religious progress. 


The jeeva is but the reflection of Deva; which means, man is but the reflection of God. Humanity 
is very proximate to Divinity: but, man seldom recognises this nearness. He allows his mind to 
lower him into the animal level, from which he straggled up through many births. A diamond 
may appear as a piece of glass; but, only those who do not know its value will use it as a paper- 
weight and keep it on the table in the office room. Wise men will keep it inside an iron safe, 
under lock and key. Man is a diamond, not a piece of glass; he has to shine brilliantly, after going 
through the process of "cutting" or samskaara (purificatory acts), 


Contentment and happiness are attributes of mind 


Samskaara transforms man into God---maanava into Maadhava. We have a watch on our wrist, 
which costs Rs. 500 or 600 or even 1,000. The steel out of which the entire watch was made may 
cost only four annas; but, the samskaara it underwent by means of human skill and intelligence 
raised its value and usefulness. Man too can transform himself into a priceless instrument for 
God-realisation through the proper use of his mind and intelligence. By the forceful alchemy of 
the mind, he can attain jnaana (spiritual knowledge) and see the Truth that satisfies and 
illumines. 


We feel that the people of our country will be happy, if we only provide them with food, clothing 
and housing. We feel that they are suffering, because they have not got these things in an 
adequate measure. That is an illusion, for, contentment and happiness are attributes of the mind. 
The mind must be trained to achieve peace and acquire joy. Without such a mind, man is 
helpless even under the most affluent circumstances. A person may be strong, and charming; but, 
when he has lost his eyesight, he loses joy. There are many countries on the very peak of 
material civilization and are very proud about the heights which they have reached. But, have 
they acquired mental peace? Have they got rid of fear or hate, greed or pride? 


Of course, there must be a certain degree of comfort for man, physical and mental. But, gaining 
the things that give comfort should not be the aim of living; once that path is selected, wants 
multiply and satisfaction becomes a will-o'- the-wisp. The capacity to distinguish between fight 
and wrong will be dulled; egoism will become sharp and strong. Thirst will increase with each 
quaff; hunger will gnaw more and more with each morsel of the food of material possessions. 
That is their real nature. 


Ask yourself the basic question: Is there something that can be called sukha? Can it be attained 
by the accumulation of material things? No. Sukha (happiness), can be got and retained only 
through Aathmajnaana (the knowledge of the Self) through the Aathma which is the source and 
spring of Aanandha. We delude ourselves when we argue that happiness can be derived from 
things outside ourselves. 


By losing your separateness, you lose misery 


Life as man is the chance given to every one to achieve one glorious end, namely, realising the 
Aathma and its Universality. He queries every one about his name and whereabouts; but, does 
not know an iota of his own identity. Who are you, really? You are not the body or the senses or 
the intellect or the mind, for you speak as if you own them and are different from them, when 
you say, my body, my senses, my intellect, my mind. He who is the master of all these is the 'T', 
the 'I' that makes every one else also feel similarly. With every breath, man inhales the 
consciousness that the Universal eternal Principle that pervades and persists in the entire 
Creation. That is why he is repeating silently, Soham, with the inhalation and the exhalation, 
Soham. During deep sleep, two ideas, (the very duality) disappear. The idea of "that" and the 
idea of "this" go, leaving only the sense of 'I'; sa and ham fade out leaving only Om, in the 
sounds soham. That is the seed sound, the Pranava, which is the Praan (breath). Merge in that 
Om, the Primal Universal Sound and you lose your separateness and your misery and pain. 


That is the ultimate stage of man---his Antha Vedhaantha---the final stage of man, his 
Vedhaantha, his. jnaana. Man starts as a Brahmachaari, a student of the Brahmic, the Aathmic 
path; he enters the Grihastha (householder) stage, the stage of apprenticeship in the joys and 
pleasures of the world; then he promotes himself into the Vaanaprastha (recluse in the forest) 
stage, of detachment and discrimination; that leads him on to the Sanyaasa (ascetic) stage, of 
intense spiritual exercise. This ends in the consummation of Samyoga (merging in the Absolute), 
like the river merging in the sea, losing in the process, its taste, its form and its name. He who 
knows Brahman becomes Brahman; the river that enters the sea becomes the sea. 


Fill every act of service with Prema 


You are all engaged in service of one type or other and I know that you are frustrated with the 
result; you are not happy at the service you do, nor are the recipients happy when they receive 
the help. But, try to develop prema (unselfish Love), based on Sathya, Dharma and Shaanthi; try 
to fill every act of service with that Prema, try to see every act of service that you receive with 
the eye of prema; then, there will be no frustration. The person who serves is the person served; 
you serve yourself when you serve another. You serve another because his suffering causes you 
anguish and by relieving it, you want to save yourselves from that anguish. Unless you have that 
anguish, your service will be hollow and insincere. 


Frustration is caused also by wrong diagnosis of the causes of suffering. A patient may be 
beating his head, for he is having excruciating pain in the stomach; his pain will not be 
diminished, if you apply some ointment on the head, imagining that his trouble is centred on the 
head which he was seen beating. Delay does not matter; discover the real root of the trouble and 
then apply :the remedy. The real remedy for all troubles is a proper sense of values---first things 
first. Married couples think they will be happy, when they get a child; but, that is but the 
beginning of a series of worries. They worry about his health, his habits, his schooling, his 
friends, his mate, his marriage, his prospects---and so on, in an endless chain. The mind 
multiplies the roots of worry, anxiety, and grief. 


There can be no peace without eliminating the mind 


We say ‘peace of mind’; but, unless the mind is eliminated, there can be no peace. The mind is 
but a pattern of desires, warp and woof of wishes, resolutions, plans, ambitions, attempts, 
attachments. A young man of twenty with his two feet walks about free, wherever he likes. He 


marries and becomes a quadruped; his walk is rendered slow; it is circumscribed. He gets a child 
and he becomes six-legged. The more the legs the slower the movement, the nearer the ground, 
the greater the attachment to things earthy. 


You can develop detachment by dwelling on the great heritage of man; then, you will not engage 
yourself in low deeds and thoughts. Man is called in the Indian texts, manu-ja, he who is born of 
Manu, the great exponent of Dharma-shaasthra. So, Dharma (righteousness) is his heritage; he 
has no right to deny Dharma or act contrary to it. Contemplate on that Dharma, on Sathya and 
Prema which are the foundations of that Dharma, and then, all your acts will be in consonance 
with real Bharatheeya culture. See your self in all and in yourself. That alone entitles you to be a 
sevak, to serve. 


This expansive Prema was cultivated in our country, under the leadership of its sages and seers; 
so, many saadhaks (spiritual aspirants) were able to succeed in seeing God's viraat swaruupa 
(Omnipresence) everywhere. For some years now, this Prema has become abridged and 
narrowed by egoism and greed, we have become so hard hearted that we are not affected at the 
sight of suffering and want. People have learnt the wrong attitude of separating themselves from 
others; so, this land of Annapoorna (abundance in food) has to go about from door to door, in 
foreign capitals, asking for food for the people. 


Meditate on the God who fills the Universe 


Try to offer people your Prema; they will respond with lasting gratitude. Give them clothes, 
houses---they are apt to lose them. Give them education; they may or may not use it for their 
good. But, give them Prema; they will imbibe it gratefully and fill their hearts with it and be 
happy as never before. You can grow in Prema, by building the mansion of your life on the four 
pillars of the Raamaayana, the Mahaabhaaratha and Bhaagavatha and the Bhagavadgeetha. If 
you are not able to read these great books and assimilate them, do not worry. Books are only 
guide-posts, with road signs. They do not indicate the ups and downs met while traversing the 
roads indicated. That can be known only by actual experience. If you are not able to understand 
the big texts, I would advise you to simply contemplate on the wonder and beauty of God's 
handiwork, from the tiny worm to the most distant star, from the circulation of blood in one's 
own body to the movement of planets and solar systems. Meditate on the God who fills the 
Universe and transcends it; then, that glory will fill you and you can never more be small-minded 
or mean. Your acts and words will echo the glory of God. Seva that comes from such experience 
will certainly bear fruit. 


Bombay, 6-11-1967 


The body is a house taken by you on rent. When your condition 
improves, you shift to a more comfortable house paying higher 
rent; when your condition deteriorates, you have to move into a 
house inferior to the one you now occupy. So earn more spiritual 
wealth and try to move into a more comfortable 'house' where you 
can lead a better life. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


41. As He Wills 


I HAVE selected you from among the assembled in order to shape you into Sevaks (volunteers) 
during the Birthday Festival that begins tomorrow. I have spoken many times before, about the 
discipline that I would like you to submit yourself to. You can examine yourself and decide how 
far you have succeeded in observing those rules of conduct. 


The world today is torn by factions and fear and it is imperative that the good are assured of 
peace and the general level of living is raised to a higher moral standard by the propagation of 
Dharma. People must become proficient in Sathya, Dharma, Shaanthi, Prema and Ahimsa, 
weapons that can overwhelm the passions that have turned heart into a den of wickedness. This 
chance to become a Sevak here is but the first step in training in the proper use of these weapons. 


Do not imagine that this is a temporary responsibility, which you shoulder today and lay down in 
a few days. This is a form of worship into which you are initiated so that your hearts may be 
cleansed and God reflected therein. This training as a volunteer will lead you to see the bliss of 
Aathmaanandha and the Light of Reality. It will induce you to search for your own inner truth, 
your swa-swaruupa (own natural form). All the acts you perform must be directed towards one 
end: drawing down on you the Grace of God. All the provisions stocked in the store-room in 
your house are there to meet one purpose: appease your hunger. So too all Karma is for attaining 
God. 


Getting fixed in Faith is genuine education 


But, caught in the darkness of Ajnaana (spiritual ignorance), man mistakes the purpose. He 
imagines that he can be happy, if he caters to his senses; this is only self-deception. The ego is 
not the cause of this; the real culprit is the darkness produced by ignorance of the goal of life. 
Believe that God resides in every one as the Aathma, which illumines his senses and the vision. 
Then, the darkness will disappear and Light will prevail. Learning the process of getting fixed in 
that faith is the genuine education. The others are lamps that have no flame, that cannot dispel 
darkness. They may be designated so, but that name is misnomer. 


When you call yourself a Sevak, offering service to another, have also reverence in your mind 
that the person whom you serve is the Lord Himself in that form. This attitude is very helpful for 
the Saadhak. Maanava seva is Maadhava seva---the service of man is service of God. But, 
when? When we feel in the depth of heart that the person whom you serve is a wave of the same 
sea from which you derive your individuality, your taste, your name and form. I have called you 
in today and I am naming you as "Volunteers" in order to give you an opportunity to practise this 
Saadhana of Maadhava seva through Maanava seva. 


Do not therefore take this as a new authority conferred on you, or as a burden landed on your 
shoulders. Acceptance of the Will of God has its own advantage; it yields rich fruits. Hanumaan 
did not become conceited when Raama selected him for the crucial southward search and when 
Raama gave into his custody the Ring to be given to Seetha (assuring him in the process that he 
would certainly succeed in discovering her); nor was he affected by fear, at the tremendous 
responsibility that was heaped on him. He just accepted what was given; he was neither happy 
nor unhappy. He felt that Raama the Lord knows all and so his duty was only to obey. 


God's tests are for giving you greater Grace 


You must cultivate the same attitude towards my commands and instructions. Be convinced that 


if you obey them strictly, you will attain victory. One evening Krishna took Arjuna far out of 
Dwaraka City and while they were alone together, He pointed at a bird flying over their heard 
and asked him "Arjuna, isn't that a dove?" Arjuna agreed; he said it was a dove. Suddenly, 
Krishna turned towards him and said, "No, it is a crow." Arjuna concurred and said, "I am sorry, 
it certainly is a crow." Immediately, Krishna asked him, "A crow, no, it must beazkite. Is it not 
so?" and Arjuna promptly agreed. "Yes. It is a kite." At this, Krishna smiled and asked Arjuna, 
"Are you in your senses? What exactly do you see? Why you say, of the same bird, it is a dove, it 
must be a crow and it is a kite?" Arjuna said, "Who am I to dispute your statement? You can 
make it a crow even if it is not one, or, change it into a kite. I have found that the safest thing is 
to agree with you, in full faith. I know of no other course." It was only after this test, for 
unflinching faith that Krishna assured himself of the credentials of Arjuna to receive the Geetha 
advice. 


The inquiry about the identity of the bird was a test. God tests man so; you must welcome tests. 
Tests are only for giving you greater grace. They are not to be treated as punishments. It 
promotes your confidence. You enter a house and decide to live there, only after you are assured 
that the foundation is secure, is it not? When your faith is fixed, your life too will flow in peace. 


Wishes can never win peace 


All who come to Prashaanthi Nilayam are your kith and kin, remember. Respect them, serve 
them with that attitude. To have such attitude you must have deep patience. Praise or blame, 
appreciation or criticism, you must bear all with fortitude. Never yield to anger or dispiritedness. 
The command is pre-emminent; have your mind fixed on that. The rest is but incidental. The 
Dharma shaasthras lay down that women, the sick, those who are burdened with loads, and the 
aged have to be helped and given first preference. Even if the sick man is a decrepit low-born 
man, the Emperor has to give him the right of way and allow him to be served first; else, he 
invites punishment from the Gods. The aged have accumulated much more experience than you; 
they are filled with sweetness, like ripe fruits. The wise men or Jnaanis have also to be served 
and revered. What is the sweetness, in these? It is the quality of Shaantham, of being unruffled at 
the ups and downs of life. 


The asceticism that you have to adopt is just this: Obey the Aajna, the order of the Lord. You 
have no need to fast and torture the body: can you kill the snake by beating the mound, which 
has it in its hole? Can torment teach you the truth? Control thoughts; divert feelings; canalise the 
currents of the impulses. The pendulum will stop its swing only when you stop winding the clock 
with its key. Stop winding; then the pendulum will remain at one point; the mind will remain at 
the Feet of God. 


Wishes can never win peace; a wish is tiny seed from out of which a huge tree emanates, the tree 
in its turn scatters a crore of seeds, which sprout into crores of trees. Fry the seed and it will not 
sprout again. When wishes multiply quick and fast, concentration is impossible; when water is 
poured on a height, it flows along the inclines, down into the hollows. Concentration is the 
reverse process: rolling a rock uphill. This requires unintermittent effort, unbroken attention, and 
ceaseless striving. Allow confidence to slacken but a moment---the rock will come rolling down. 


Each volunteer should become a centre of inspiration 


You have another great responsibility, too. This land, Bhaarath, has to guide others in selfless 
service, in the development of an attitude of detached devotion to duty. From ancient times, India 


is famous as the land of dedicated Karma, of holy living and thinking, of incessant subduing of 
the harmful passions surging in the mind, of the tireless pursuit of the goal of Peace. But, latterly, 
Indians too have been infected by the diseases prevalent in other parts of the world; they have 
started spuming holy company, sacred books and spiritual discipline. This is a tragedy; once 
again, the ancient modes of life have to be revived; the ancient attitudes have to be appreciated 
and adopted. That faith in the imperishable Aathman (which 1s the reality of both the individual 
and the Universe) has once again to vitalise activities. 


Being Sevaks and volunteers, you must adhere to Truth, first and foremost. Whatever be the 
temptation, do not slide away from Truth. In fact, after wearing this badge as the sign of your 
dedication to service, you must not deviate from Sathya, Dharma, Shaanthi and Prema. When a 
man takes up the role of Harischandra on the stage, he has to adhere to Truth so long at least as 
he is on the stage. So also, so long as you wear this badge, stick to these four qualities. Then, 
when you find how happy you feel, how well you are able to move with your fellow beings, you 
will yourself appreciate the path and stick to it. It is not only during a Navaraathri or a 
Shivaraathri or a Deepaavali Festival, not only at Prashaanthi Nilayam for a few days---but, 
always and everywhere, you must stick to these virtues. Each one of you will then be a centre of 
inspiration in your villages. Factions and fear will cease; all will be like brothers and sisters, 
through your silent influence and example. 


Each little act of self-control is Saadhana 


These badges must curb your conceit, not fan them into harmful pride. They are not symbols of 
authority; they are but pointers indicating that the wearer is a trustworthy friend, an efficient 
worker, a smiling kinsman, a devoted guide, an inspiration. Most of the people who come here 
are in distress, physical or mental. As mentioned in the Geetha, "Anithyam asukham lokam imam 
praapya bhajaswa maam". “Having come to this world, which is transitory add full of travail, 
worship Me, pray to Me." So they come seeking peace, joy and courage, hope, vitality and 
confidence. They must be welcomed with reverence and sympathy, love and consideration. Try 
to know that type of behaviour, which line of conduct, which attitude of service will please Me; 
then, follow that type, that line, that attitude. Then, your service too will be fruitful. I do not like 
people smoking and so, give up smoking; I do not like harsh language, loud noise, wild 
behaviour, demeaning conversation on low topics---so, avoid them. I like sweet soft low talk; so, 
practise that. Do not push or drag; do not just order about! Tell every one the reason why certain 
rules and disciplines have been laid down; try to convince and win the co-operation of people. 
Here, everything is part of saadhana and so, each little act of self-control helps advancement. 
Don't rush forward yourselves, into vantage positions near the dais; wherever you are you can 
win Grace, doing the duty allotted to you. By neglecting the duty and rushing forward, be 
warned that you are only denying yourself the Grace. I see all things everywhere; so, there is no 
need for you to push and rush to catch My eye. 


What you feel, that you become 


The Lord values the mental attitude behind each act. Yad bhaavam, thad bhaavathi---what you 
feel, that you become. Transmute every act into an item of puuja, of worship; then, derive 
maximum joy. Sai in every being; so, do not slight any. Revere and serve all, to the best of your 
ability. When some one calls out for water to slake his thirst and you offer him a cup, feel that 
you are offering it to Me; then, the act purifies you more and cleanses you. It is not the man in 
need that you serve; you are serving God, that is in you and him. 


Karma is the flower and Jnaana is the fruit. The flower becomes the fruit, in the fullness of time. 
Only, one has to guard it and keep it free from pests. Charcoal is wood that has undergone but a 
part of the baptism of fire; let it undergo that baptism to the full; it becomes white, light ash that 
flies with the wind into the four quarters. The purification of mind from the passions have to be 
taken up through the fire of Jnaana until success is gained. In saadhana, there is no half-way 
house, no resting place. 


Your installation on the throne of Aathma-realisation, as the monarch of your own inner 
consciousness, is the consummation of saadhana of life itself. One can sacrifice everything for 
the sublime success. The Paandavas gave up the empire for which they struggled long and 
sacrificed four million lives on the battlefield, so that they may get enthroned as such monarch. 
They sought the peace of the Himalayas in the later phase of their life. Only by "giving up" can 
that status be won. The Upanishadhs say that immortality can be achieved, not by sacred acts, 
nor by virtuous progeny, nor by accumulated wealth, but only by "giving up," Thyaaga. You 
have to give up all attachment to food and recreation, to I and Mine when you yearn for the Lord. 


Voice of God can be heard in the silence alone 


A picture printed on paper cannot be peeled off it; it becomes inherent in it. The Lord's name and 
form must be so imprinted on your heart. You wear the badge with this portrait on your chest; 
the original of the portrait must be worn on the heart, imprinted on the heart. 


The Gopees had done that. Prahlaadha too had achieved it. That is the reason why he did not wail 
or protest, when he was subjected to torture and torment; he saw, he heard, he felt, he knew only 
Maaraayana, the Lord. Try to develop that deep faith and devotion. 


One other point: In this Prashaanthi Nilayam, you should see that Prashaanthi is preserved. 
Emphasise this step in saadhana before all. In the silence alone, can the Voice of God be heard. 
Serve the thousands who are arriving here, in this spirit and with these objects in view; that is the 
way to obey the Will, the Aajna. The aajna (command) is the boat that will take you across the 
Sea of Change, into the Eternal and the Absolute. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 22.11.1967 


42. The Garden of no-grief 


BHAKTHI is the state of mind in which one has no separate existence apart from God. The 
Bhaktha's very breath is God; his every act is by God, for God; his thoughts are of God; his 
words are uttered by God, about God. For, like the fish which can live only in water, man can 
live only in God--in peace and happiness. In other media, he has only fear, frantic struggle, 
failure. The Nandhi (Bull) is the lower nature of man; when it is used as the vehicle of God it 
secures a place in front of the central shrine of God and it shares some of the adoration offered to 
God. It is only association with the Divine that can confer value and significance. The mind too 
gets illumined, and feels joy, peace or calm, only because the peace, joy and calm, which are the 
native characteristics of the Aathma (God) within are reflected on it. 


There is no attempt on the part of man in recent times to grasp this truth and to gain the constant 
Awareness. A beast, when it falls into a slough, struggles to get out of it and save itself; but man, 
who has fallen into this slough of down-dragging desire, does not make any effort to lift himself 
up from it! Shiva is depicted in the Shaasthras and Puraanas as carrying a begging bowl! In fact, 
He is said to use a cranium as the bowl! What is He asking from man? He is the giver, He is the 
person who demands. He demands only what He has given---namely, a pure heart. He gave it 
pure; He wants it back as pure as when He gave it. He filled man with Love; He asks for that 
Love. 


Surrendering all facilities to the Lord is Prapatthi 


The Raamaayana and the Mahaabhaaratha teach the vast possibilities of Love and the bunds 
between which the Love has to flow, to irrigate the thought, word and deed. Dharma sets the 
bounds; it lays down the goal. Seetha stuck to Dharma, as fast as Raama did; Dhroupadhi stuck 
to Dharma as fast as Dharmaraaja did. Mothers such as these suckled the heroes of Bhaarath, and 
so, this land became the nursery of sages. Seetha had supreme Bhakthi towards the Lord however 
far He was; Dhroupadhi lived every moment with and by Lord Krishna, the guardian of the 
Paandavas, however distant he was. The lotus on the lake is far, far away from the Sun; but 
distance is no bar for the dawn of love; the lotus blooms as soon as the Sun peeps over the 
horizon. The moon is so far away, but, when the moon shines in the sky, children clap their hand 
and run about in glee, happy that Uncle’ Moon is smiling on them. 


The aborigine in the forest shoots the birds; that is legitimate so far as his stage of life and his 
means of livelihood are concerned. But, the ascetic in the forest who is engaged in discovering 
the spring of Divine Love in himself will be committing a grievous wrong which will undermine 
his progress, if he denies love to the bird on the tree. So too, every profession, every state of life, 
each sex, each period of life as fixed by age---childhood, boyhood, adolescence, youth, middle 
age, old age---has duties and obligations, which set the norm and guide the individual to benefit 
himself and society. When Seetha was fixed in the Dharma of the wife, she saw Raama in all 
beings. Though she was surrounded by frightful female monsters, she did not notice them; 
though she was interned in a charming garden, named Garden of No-grief (A-shoka), she did not 
see any flower around her. Her eyes, her mind, her thoughts were filled with Raama only. This is 
the condition of Prapatthi---surrender of all faculties to the Lord. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 23-11-1967 


The ego has to sacrifice itself so that man's divine nature can 
manifest itself, "Mine" is death; ‘not mine’ is immortality. 
Renunciation results in peace. The golden key of non-attachment 
opens the lock which keeps the door to heaven shut. "Give up; I 
shall fill the gap" says Jesus. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


43. Pilgrims! Do not tarry! 


WHEN Arjuna plaintively approached Krishna for courage and consolation, the Lord advised 
him, "manmanaabhaava"---"Fill your mind with Me. Let all urges be for Me, let all acts be 
dedicated to Me." The mind has no strength of its own; it has to lean on some person or thing all 
the time. It is like the stray cow that trespasses into field and eats off growing crops. If you feed 
it well in your own farm its trespassing habit will vanish. Your pet dog will wander in the bazaar 
for scrapings from dustbins, if you do not feed it full at home. Give the dog a nice full meal; it 
will lie under the porch and guard your house! The mind too can be weaned away from vicious 
desires if you feed it on good thoughts, good resolutions, tenderness and love. Then only will it 
serve your best interests. 


Raamakrishna Paramahamasa told an addict that he must not consume more than a given 
quantity of opium; he gave him a piece of chalk, to weigh every day the quantity of opium he can 
eat---no more, no less! But, he imposed a condition, whose usefulness in helping him to conquer 
the bad habit the addict did not realise then. It was that every time he used the weight he had to 
write on a slate, the Pranava (Om), before putting it on the scale of the balance. The fellow 
obeyed; the chalk was reduced in weight with every Om, until it was eliminated in full; the 
opium habit too was reduced out of existence! The Om also helped to transfer his attachment 
from the opium-induced tranquillity to the everlasting Bliss of God-intoxication. 


Sensitive sympathy of a saint for his disciples 


Man is on a long pilgrimage towards God. He moves from one life to another to the goal of 
Splendour. On the way he has to take shelter in many caravanserais, or rest-house, but, however 
attractive these may be, he cannot strike root but has to remind himself of the journey's end! 
Once when Samartha Raamadaas was moving about the countryside with his disciples, those 
behind him saw a fine field of juicy sugar cane and entered it and started pulling out the cane and 
crunching it with great relish. The owner of the field was naturally enraged at their behaviour 
and at the loss to which they were subjecting him; he fell upon them with a stout cane. The 
Master was sorry that they broke discipline so badly, drawn by the desire of the tongue for the 
sweet juice. Next day they reached Emperor Shivaji's Palace, where a great welcome awaited the 
Guru and his followers. 


Shivaji offered to attend personally to the Guru during his ceremonial bath; when Raamadaas 
undressed, Shivaji was shocked to find broad red marks, indicating that he had been beaten! 
Such was the sensitive sympathy of the great saint that he received on his back the blows meant 
for his pupils; Shivaji sent for the owner of the field of cane; and, when he stood shivering in fear 
before the Emperor and his Guru, Raamadas was requested by Shivaji to inflict on him any 
punishment he liked. But, Raamadas accepted that wrong was committed by his disciples, that 
they should not have allowed the cane to attract them into theft. He blessed the farmer and 
granted him a boon that his lands will be tax-free for ever! 


The sandalwood tree will lend its fragrance even to the axe which cuts it down. That is the nature 
of the good and the great. Follow their example: do not merely bang the table in your lectures, 
asserting the glory of the sons and daughters of India. If you are hypocritically banging the table, 
the table will laugh at you and bang back at you---action and reaction being equal and opposite. 


Do the karma which will make more karma unnecessary 


Ants build their city grain by grain, selecting the finest mud for the purpose, the result being in 
impregnable rockfort, where they can live in security. You should also gather, grain by grain, act 
by act, the wherewithal to build a secure future for yourselves, a mansion of Dharma. You must 
swallow the drug that will render drugs unnecessary; you should do the Karma, which will make 
further Karma unnecessary. But, the drug that is eaten now intensifies the drug habit; one Karma 
leads to a thousand, in order to cover up the consequences. The Incarnation has come to point the 
way out of this vicious circle.’ Hand over to Me your hundred thousand paltry Karmas and 
worries---each one, a paisa. If they are genuine and sincere, I shall take them all and give you a 
thousand-rupee currency note (Grace) which is lighter and easier to keep. Of course even if one 
pain or grief or worry or fear is counterfeit, the Note will not be given. 


The Upanishadhs were not composed or collected by persons who craved fame or fortune; nor 
are they the vapourings of idlers and scribblers. They have the true ring of actual experience. 
They arose out of compassion for others wandering in the wilderness, out of concentration on the 
means of liberation from the dual chain of tears and triumph. Those upon whom the people are 
traditionally depending for guidance have become callous, forgetting their task, or involved in 
darkness and dialectics. So, there is need to spread the message of Love, which is the message of 
God. Simplicity is the sign of Divinity. Pomp, paraphernalia, jaw-breaking formulae, 
abracadabra, dark mysterious mumblings---these are alien to the spirit of true religion. These are 
tricks by which man wants to monopolise or gain God. 


Control of senses increases efficiency 


A bottle gourd when green will sink in water; but, a dry one will float. The mind is the gourd. 
Dry it in the sun of knowledge, let the weight of attachment, the green of 'greed' disappear; you 
can float happily over the waves of care. Journeying through life without knowing the control of 
the senses is like venturing to ride a brakeless car. Disaster is certain. Control increases 
efficiency; removal of embankments, bonds, brakes, limits---this robs life of sweetness and sense 
of adventure. How can you play football without rules, 'hands,' ‘offside,’ 'foul play' and similar 
limits on freedom to hit and kick? 


The five elements---ether, air, fire, water and earth---are the vesture of God, as well as of Man. 
Use them, moderately and with wisdom, with fear and humility. Their characteristics, for which 
they are sought after, are sabdha (sound) of the sky, representing aakasha (ether); sparsha 
(touch) of vaayu (wind); ruupa (form) of Agni (Fire), rasa (flavour, taste) of Ap (water); and 
gandha (smell) of prithvi (earth). Even these, sound and others, have to be moderate if they have 
to confer comfort. Care kills quicker and surer than disease. Man misuses his intelligence and 
memory to grieve over the past and plan far into the future. Thereby he loses his heritage of 
peace and joy. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 24-11-1967 


Creation, preservation and merging are the three forms of the 
Divine Will. By Karma yoga, you grasp the meaning of creation 
and the created; by Bhakthi yoga, you understand the preserver 
and the preserved; by Jnaana yoga, you merge into the principle 
from which you have emerged 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


44, Naamasmarana--the Panacea 


DIAMOND cuts diamond. Thom removes thorn. Karma cures Karma. Karma, derided as causing 
the dualities of grief-joy, pain-pleasure, birth-death, also brings about liberation from the chain 
of duality. Karma causes both bondage and liberation. The sun rises; that act unfolds the petals of 
the lotus flower, but, folds the petals of the Aumudha flower! The sun sets; that act makes the 
good men hurry home to the company of their family, but, it makes bad men hurry out of their 
dens to the places where they revel and rob. The palm falls on the mridhuanga; the sound is 
pleasant to the ear. It falls on an empty tin; the sound grates the ear. Karma ruins; Karma saves. 


What is the nature of the Karma that saves? Holding fast to Shivam (God), as the boy 
Maarkandeya did. By this, you can foil death and earn eternal joy. What is the nature of the 
Karma that ruins? Holding fast to Shavam (corpse). 


By this, you earn endless toil in slime and sorrow. What is Shavam? It is the delusion that you 
are the 'body'; what is Shivam? It is the consciousness that you are the Indweller, the Inner 
Motivator, the Anthar-yaamin. 


How can you hold fast to Shivam? By fixing your mind on the Name of the Lord, the Indweller. 
By the repetition of the Name, with the alert awareness of the Glory It summarises. The Name is 
the container of immeasurable potence. The Word has much power; in fact, even common words 
denoting things do possess some potency. For example, when the word denoting some thing very 
sour to the taste is pronounced within hearing, you find that your tongue waters. When the word 
denoting some thing that is awfully disgusting is pronounced within your hearing, you are 
afflicted with nausea. When such is the effect of the pronunciation of common words, what can 
we say of the tremendous transformation that takes place when the sweet sustaining Name of the 
Ever-present Indweller is pronounced! It purifies, it cleanses; it elevates; it spreads its fragrance 
in the atmosphere; it inspires. 


Mind must be transmuted into the essence of Godhead 


The Name must, however, flow in the mind in an uninterrupted stream. Naamasmarana 1s a yoga 
(process of uniting with God); that is to say, it is a means of chiththa viriththi nirodha---of 
calming the agitations of the mind, subduing the waves of emotions and feelings. The Naama 
(Name) must always be associated, while intent on the smarana (remembering, recalling), with 
the Naami (the Named One). It is not a mere sound; it is a significance, the symbol of a Form, of 
a Fact. All the obligatory as well as optional acts pertaining to the process of 'living' can be gone 
through, with the Name-awareness as the inspiring background. The mind must be merged in the 
Godhead; it must be transmuted into the essence of Godhead. When the branch of a tree rubs 
against another, heat is generated and in the depths of a forest, fires are started when this heat 
grows strong. Rub a stone over another; heat is generated. But, the process must be without 
break; breaks only decrease the heat. So, the repetition of the Name in the mind must be without 
break. Then the fire of Jnaana (Realisation of the Reality) will burn out all weakness and 
delusion. 


Indulal Shah spoke to you now of the World Conference of Sathya Sai Organisations to be held 
at Bombay, 1968. Such Organisations have been established and are working in many countries 
in order to spread Light and Hope among all peoples. For me, all countries are equally dear; the 
Universe is the Body of God. Ideas like my country, are all for limited minds, intellects that are 
bound within boundaries. 


There are thousands of institutions that profess to spread Bharatheeya Culture and preserve and 
publicise it; they are mostly engaged in campaigns for collection of funds. In the Sathya Sai 
Organisations, money is not the criterion. It need only your hearts, for My Residence and 
Happiness. I do not like other temples or altars. Purify the heart, by Naamasmarana; J shall 
come, and dwell therein. 


Prashaanthi Nilayam, 26-11-196 7 


We call the home, BHA VAN. The word has two syllables---BHA 
and VAN. If there is no BHA (Bhagavaan - God) in the home, if the 
light of God does not shine therein, it is only a VAN or a jungle. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


45. The treasure under your feet 


ALL acts must be done as offerings to him, dedicated to Him, prompted, planned, executed and 
blessed by Him. The smarana (remembrance) of the Name will help this Saadhana. The name 
has to be repeated with the heart yearning for the Named. It should not be like a tape-recorder 
reeling off the names of a gramophone plate that has stuck, repeating the same note. Know that 
this life is for realising Him, not for winning petty triumphs. Your ideal, your determination and 
your activity, all three must be directed to the same consummation, the attainment of Supreme 
Bliss. The Name will make all activity as welcome as worship; it will add witness to worship 
itself; it will concretise the Named. It will confer the Wisdom that reveals the Truth. 


The sweetness of the Name is appreciated most by those who walk the path of Bhakthi. Once 
Jnaanadev and Shaanthadev happened to go together through a dense forest; they were both 
overcome by severe thirst but, could not discover any source of water, except a deep ruined well, 
with water far too deep and the sides overgrown with bush and briar. Jnaanadev assumed the 
form of a bird, flew in and slaked his thirst. Shaanthadev, who was a great Bhaktha, yearned for 
the Grace from the Lord whom He called agonisingly by Name; the Lord heard the prayer. The 
waters of the well rose and overflowed, to the place where the Bhaktha was, he could slake his 
thirst and move on. 


God is undefinable by Names or Forms 


The magnet cannot draw to itself a bit of iron that is covered with rust and dust. You cannot 
yearn for God when your mind is ladden with the rust of material desires and when the dust of 
sensual craving sits heavy on it. Clear the rust, know the Glory of the God and repeat His Name, 
in the silence of the heart. Any one of the Names which denote Him can be selected. Do not 
listen to people who canvass for one particular Name and cavil at others. Do not be misguided by 
people who make pompous polysyllabic formulae and recommend them as superior to other 
similar Names. Vasudeva, Krishna, Gopaal, Gopeevallabha, Govind, Giridhaari---all these 
indicate the Lord who is known to most as Krishna. But, Meera was affected most by one Name: 
Giridhaari. That gave her inexhaustible joy, more than any other name. There is no superior or 
inferior grade of Names so far as God is concerned. You must have noticed that I do not 
recommend any one name for adoption by you; no, I do not insist on the Sai Name, either of this 
body or the previous body. All Names are the names of Sai Baaba, they are all mine. 


This is the greatness of the Sanaathana Dharma (Eternal Religion)---this insistence on the 
Oneness behind all the apparent multiplicity. The Aathma that it declares to be the basic Truth 
does not contradict the doctrines of any faith. God is unlimited by space or time. He is 
undefinable by names or forms. He owns all names and will respond to any one of them. Picture 
Him in any form while meditating on him; He assumes that form, while conferring Grace. It is 
because India stressed these characteristics of the Highest Principles that she has been for 
centuries the Beacon of Spiritual Light and Hope. 


Now we find anxiety, fear, faction, hate and vengeance stalking across all countries. Neighbours 
hate each other; members of the same family hate each other and fight among themselves. 
Villages are torn by factions, they fight among themselves. Nations are arming wildly and 
breeding hatred among themselves. Man has reduced himself to the status of a wild beast. No 
two minds are willing to co-operate in common tasks. The spark that arises in the individual 
mind has spread a world-wide conflagration of hate and greed. This has to be scotched in the 


individual, the family, the village, the city, the nation---in fact wherever it raises its head. Sathya, 
Dharma, Shaanthi and Prema can put out this fire. Man is suffering, because he is not aware of 
the treasure he has in himself. Like a beggar ignorant of the millions hidden under the floor of 
his hovel, he is suffering dire misery. 


Each and every conscious being has a Dharma of its own. Man's 
Dharma is to realise his own Reality. The word Maanava reminds 
him of this. Maa (ignorance), na (without), va (action)---He who 
acts without ignorance or ajnaana, that is, He who is jnaani is a 
Man. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


46. Truth and Love 


THE conference of the Office-Bearers of the Sathya Sai Organisations in Kerala State has been 
called in order to assess how far the resolutions made at Madras Conference at the All-India level 
are put into practice and in order to prepare the Organisations for the World Conference that is to 
be held in May 1968. I have come amidst you because this is an appropriate occasion when I can 
give you the joy of Darshan. You know that these organisations---Seva Samithis, Bhajana 
Mandalis, Seva Sanghams---are for awakening in man the consciousness of the Divinity inherent 
in him and to encourage him to cultivate it, so that he could blossom into a real Saadhaka and 
then into a Saadhu (detached, devoted, virtuous, wise, aspirant), and finally into a Liberated 
Personality merged in the Supreme. 


You are about a hundred and fifty in number; your President said that the number of 
Organisations is still small, but I am not enamoured of mere numbers. For, this is not like any 
other Organisation. This does not seek to establish a new cult or sect, a new type of Japa or 
Dhyaana, a novel ritual, an initiation that separates people as 'disciples' within the fold and 'non- 
initiates’ without the fold. It seeks to restrain Thamoguna (dullness, ignorance, and all the evils 
that arise from these) and Rajoguna (passion, violent emotion, desire, egoism and consequent 
evils); it instills in men the Truth that all are kin in Aathma, that the stranger is but oneself in 
another habiliment, and that service to another is the best service that one can do to oneself. 


All are limbs of one body, nourished by the self-same life-blood, motivated by the same Will, the 
Will of God; bound by the same Divine Law. That is the Vishwaruupa (Cosmic Vision), that one 
must see and experience: God in all, God everywhere. That endows you with everlasting 
Aanandha. 


God is the Father, mankind the children 


Feelings of hatred, malice, envy and pride that create separation between men who are kin, arise 
from identification with the body. You feel and believe you are the body; you know your body is 
separate from the other bodies; your hunger, your thirst, your comfort, your family, your 
community, your state--'thus, you create bounds for your love, and crib yourselves, treating all 
outside the bounds as enemies, strangers, competitors. But the source is one, the sustenance is 
one: God the Father, mankind the children. Pay attention to the Fatherhood, more than to the 
brotherhood. That will underline the brotherhood more and more in your heart and remove the 
poison of distinction that has come through ignorance. 


Man is a pilgrim, who has already come a long way from birth to birth. The journey so far 
accomplished decides how far he has to go still. If he has lost his way and meandered into the 
deserts or jungles, he will have a great distance to travel yet. If he has been led right, his 
pilgrimage will end soon successfully. Cultivate sympathy with fellow-pilgrims, seek to know 
the right path; learn to guide and be earnest to reach the goal, safe and quick. 


Don't have crookedness in your speech 


These organisations are meant to broaden your love, to canalise your activities along lines of 
constructive service performed, as worship, not to confer on some people more power over 
others, or greater control over the activities of other members, or for the display of the devotion 
of some people. All must be conscious of this, all the time. Help the weak and the unwary at all 
times. 


You have two eyes in your consciousness, namely, Sathya and Ahimsa. They are the guides 
which will take you to the goal, the two lights, the sun and the moon of the inner firmament. If 
you want to know the way in which you have to observe Sathya or Truth in speech, look into the 
Geetha. It tells you that the best speech is “anudvegakaram vaakyam" (speech that does not 
create pain or anger or grief to others). The Shaasthras also say, "Sathyam bruyaath, priyam 
bruyaath na bruyaath Sathyam apriyam"---"Speak the truth, but speak pleasantly. Simply 
because a statement will be welcome to the hearer, don't speak it out to win his approval; if 
speaking truth will cause grief or pain, keep silent." That is the vow of truth in ordinary daily 
life. 


Don't have hypocrisy or crookedness in your speech. Both unpleasant truth and pleasant untruth 
have to be avoided. Sathya is God Himself, as the Shruthi says, Sathye sarvam prathishtitham--- 
"All this is established on the firm foundation of Truth," say the Vedhas. So, see that no trace of 
falsehood contaminates your transactions in these organisations. Truth is My nature, My 
Mission, My Message. Organisations bearing My Name have to be strictly adhering to Truth. 


Ahimsa (non-injury) is another phase of Sathya. When once you are aware of the kinship, the 
Oneness in God, the fundamental Aathmic unity---no one will knowingly cause pain or distress 
to another. Let your Organisations promote Love, scatter Love, be fragrant with Love, and 
preach the Gospel of Love, through example. 


Emakulam (Kerala), 20-12-1967 


The one advantage that Man has over lower animals, is the vast 
treasure of human experience he has inherited from his ancestors 
through language. This is the treasure called Shaasthra; if he 
ignores Shaasthra, he is doomed to drag out an animal existence. 


Sathya Sai Baaba 


47. Spontaneous Service 


HIS morning I spoke to you about the basic outlook that you should have, when you carry on the 
various activities of the Sathya Sai Organisations; now I shall go into more details, so that you 
can chalk out various programmes of work, on behalf of the Samithis and Sanghs and Mandalis, 
in your own places. 


Members spoke now about the irreverent and wild activities of students and the need to divert 
their activities and adventures into channels which will make them useful and worthy citizens. 
They are but imitating the elders and leaders. They find their parents and teachers fighting with 
others to gain some ends or fighting among themselves to gain superiority or power. So, they too 
fight with others and among themselves. The parents, teachers and elders must set a good 
example. Otherwise all this schooling and college-going activities are sheer waste, nay, 
positively harmful. 


There is a conscience in man, whispering fight advice, restraining unjust hands, which man has 
almost succeeded in silencing; but, it is the voice of God; it can never be made dumb. Make the 
children cognisant of it. In Kerala, there is a practice, still happily existing in rural parts, of the 
elders gathering the children around them every evening and spending an hour or so reciting 
aloud the stothras in praise of God. It is essential that it must be revived. Time thus spent in is 
well spent. It will give great peace and joy. Plant a fruit tree; you get fruits therefrom. Plant neem 
trees; you cannot expect them to yield oranges! Sow falsehood, fear, faction--you reap the same. 


Perform acts of sympathy without fanfare 


Samithis can hold classes for children and tell them stories from the Upanishadhs and Epics, 
teach them Bhajans, and get dramas enacted by them on Puraanic themes. Let them also develop 
reverence towards parents, teachers and elders. The home atmosphere must be made purer, more 
holy. They must learn by observation that their parents are happy and without anxiety because 
they have full faith in God and they know that whatever happens is for the best. On Sundays, you 
can gather the children and teach them, in an attractive way, religious texts. You can give them 
some nutritious milk also at that time, so that they can get both Ksheeram and Saaram (Milk and 
Essence). 


The doctors among you can serve the poor by treating them without insisting on payment; give 
the poor all the attention and care that you lavish on the rich, paying patients. Do it for the sake 
of God; feel that it is the Puwja you are offering Him. The lawyers among you can help those, 
who for want of a skilled advocate, have to go unfended or have to suffer at the hands of 
unscrupulous men. Do not publish these acts of sympathy; do them spontaneously without 
fanfare. That is more precious than demonstrating your service with the help of headlines and 
photographs. These reduce the worth of deeds of compassion. You must be uncomfortable, when 
those around you are unhappy; when you ease their discomfort, you are making them happy and 
making yourself happy, isn't it ? Similarly, you must be happy, when those around you are 
happy. This is more difficult than the previous one; but it is the sign of the truly good. 


Service done to the disabled is a saadhana 


It is your duty to recognise all men as your kin and to share your skill with others, so that the 
maximum benefits accrue therefrom. The skill is a trust, which must rescue all. Service done in 
homes for the disabled, the defectives, the feeble minded, the delinquents, the orphans, the 


refugees---is indeed very beneficial and a good Saadhana. So too, in jails and hospitals. Visit 
these places often, give solace and strength; light lamp of devotion in the inmates. Do Bhajan; 
help them to write to their homes, give them books for reading or read books for them, be the 
kith and kin of those who have none whom they can call their own. Your smile will be a lighted 
candle in their darkness. 


Women devotees, if they have the enthusiasm and support, can start Mahila Sathsangs not only 
for Bhajans and study of sacred texts and books, but for service of women. Go among the poor in 
the slums and spread light and joy therein. Gather the helpless girls and try to provide them with 
some means of honourable livelihood. Sweeten their lives with bhajan and the Saadhana of japa 
and dhyaana. Women too have a right to know that they are the Aaathma, encased in human 
form, and they too can tap the strength, the joy and the peace that the Aathma holds. Inculcate in 
them the prayer habit; that will cleanse the mind of all impurities, and make God shine in His full 
splendour. 


Ernakulam, 20-12-1967 


48. God, Ever Near 


THE two functions happening here today, for which you have called Me, are both interesting, 
because one deals with the physical needs of man and the other, the spiritual. The Foundation 
Stone which I laid just now at the Hospital for the Children's Ward will, under the care of the 
Health Minister who is here, soon become a source of solace for the suffering. The Prayer Hall 
which I am now proceeding to open will afford solace for the mind, and strength and 
steadfastness in all endeavours that require courage and faith in a Higher Power that rules the 
Universe. Spiritual health is preserved and promoted by attention to three Gunas: Sathwa, Rajas 
and Thamas. 


Health is preserved and promoted by attention to three humours: Vaatha (wind), Pittha (bile), 
and Kapha (phlegm). Thri-dosha has to be avoided, that is to say, the three humours must not get 
vitiated or unbalanced. A healthy body is the best container for a healthy mind; illness makes the 
mind agitated and anxious. The material and the spiritual are the two pans in the balance; they 
have to be attended to, in equal measure, at least until a certain stage of progress is attained in 
spiritual development. 


Service to man can be done in either of these ways; but, serving him, by example is best of all. 
Do not be a bad example to your neighbours or family members. Be good and radiate goodness. 
That is why, when the education of a pupil was over, the teacher in ancient times exhorted the 
pupil to speak the truth and observe righteousness (Sathyam vadha, Dharmam chara). Because 
after the period of study, the young person is to engage in works, so, he has to be given the most 
beneficial advice, at the appropriate moment. The truth must be spoken, without hypocrisy and 
deceit; there should be no motive to injure. 


Service has to be done with humility and reverence 


Acts must also be regulated by the over-all supremacy of righteousness. He is asked not to 
neglect the knowledge he has acquired, but to ruminate on it and cultivate it more and more, by 
putting it to practice. "Treat the mother as God; treat the guest as God." These are important 
declarations, which must be honoured. And, then, about the gift of service, the teacher has some 
very fine advice to give. Give in reverence; give in plenty; give with modesty; give as to a friend; 
give without any thought of reward. Do not give ostentatiously. The service in the Hospital, the 
service in the Bhajan Group---all have to be done, with humility and reverence. Then only can 
they yield chiththa- suddhi (purification of mind and thought), which is the main benefit 
derivable from Seva. 


The constant recital of the Name of God---any of the million Names by which He is identified by 
human imagination or intelligence---is the best means of correcting and cleansing the mind of 
man. That is why the poet sang, "O, tongue! You are a great connoisseur in tasting and 
appreciating desirable tastes. I shall tell some that you will like most; it is true; it is extremely 
advantageous information for you. Pronounce the nectarine words, the Names of God, Govinda, 
Damodara, Maadhava, and derive exquisite joy." 


The individual and the universal are one 


By means of the Name, you can keep God ever near you. Prayer and Puuja follow the recital of 
the Name, for the Glory and grace of God draw you to adore Him and to rely on Him for all your 
needs. In the beginning, the Adored and the Adorer are distant and different; but, as the 


Saadhana becomes more confirmed and consolidated, they commingle and become more and 
more composite. For, the individual and the Universal are one; the wave in the sea. Merging 
fulfils. When merged, the ego is dissolved; all symbols and signs of the particular like name, 
form, caste, colour, creed, nationality, church, sect and the rights and duties consequent thereon, 
will fade. 


For such individuals, who have liberated themselves from the narrowness of individuality, the 
only task is the uplift of humanity, the welfare of the world and the showering of love. Even if 
they are quiet, the state of Bliss in which they are, will shower bliss on the world. Love is in all, 
Love is of all, Love is all. 


Tirupunithura, 21-12-1967
