The country is like a mother, and the culture like afather. One who does not recognize their culture can never un-derstand their motherland.India’s glorious heritage2                  Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995The culture of Bharath1 is the noblest. Bharathiyas (In-dians( are truthful and righteous. Justice and fairness are theirlife-breath. When the Eternal, Indestructible, Formless Truth isgiven a form, that is Indian Culture.Students need to uphold only sathya and dharma,which, in turn, will protect the country. Victory weds onlytruth and righteousness, not wealth or position. No matter howeducated, intelligent, or influential you are, you must fosterhuman values. It is only because human values are disregardedin Bharath today that man has lost value.What is meant by education? It is not just bookishknowledge. Can all those who know how to read and write becalled educated? Does earning degrees make one educated? Willeducation achieve its purpose without moral and spiritualtraining? If education is just for a living, are not birds andbeasts living as well? Thus, living is not sufficient. Ideals in lifeare important.Today the ancient, noble truths are misinterpreted. Na-ture, pure and sacred, is being driven far from society. Com-passion, righteousness, and discipline are shunned. Knowledgeof the ancient Vedas is on the decline while all kinds of harmfulsciences are flourishing.Since ancient times, Bharath has granted peace and com-fort to the entire world by virtue of Her spiritual treasure. Lo-kaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantu—may all worlds behappy. This has been the ideal of Indians from time immemo-Summer Showers in Brindavan 19953rial. What is the reason for destructive tendencies in today’seducation despite such a noble heritage?Parents at home, teachers at school, and leaders in soci-ety are not setting the right example. They say one thing andact otherwise. Students are observant and intelligent. Theythink, “When experienced elders behave in that manner, whycan’t we?” When the cow herself goes to graze in the field, willyou find the calf at home? Elders are the root cause of moraldecline in our land.First of all, parents at home are responsible.Parents desire only degrees, job, wealth, and positionfor their children. No parent hopes that the child be-comes devoted and noble. Parents should definitelylove their children but it should not be the love ofDhritarashtra.2 Do not support every action of yourchildren. Mistakes must be punished and good actionsappreciated. Only with such training at home, willstudents maintain their values when they enter soci-ety.True comfort and true freedomToday every student desires comfort. What is comfort?They do not understand what comfort is, and yet, they desireit! In their opinion, eating, sleeping, and leading life forgetful oftime is comfort. But to live without regard for time is not ahuman quality. Birds and animals live that way. Why be bornas a human when you want to live like an animal? No, no. Jan-toonaam Nara Janma Durlabham—among all species, a human4                  Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995birth is most difficult to obtain. It is indeed very valuable andsacred. If students live like animals, they stain not just them-selves but humanity itself. What is true comfort? It is controlof the senses and ceiling on desires. Then we become eligiblefor peace and joy. This is true freedom.What is svatantram, freedom? Freedom is not goingwhere you please and acting as you like. Sva means that whichemerges from the heart. To follow the teachings and promptingof the Atma3 emanating from the heart is true freedom. Thefour stages of saalokyam, saaroopyam, saameepyam and saa-yujyam4 are possible only by following the directives of theAtma. Sveccha or free will means following the Atma. Sveccha= sva (Self) + iccha (desire). Knowledge of the Atma, inquiryinto the Atma, and the bliss of the Atma—these constitute free-dom.Unity—today’s dire needIndia has won freedom from foreign rule, but, sadly, wehave not won unity. Students! Unity is most essential. Whatcannot be achieved by individuals can be easily achieved collec-tively. The Vedas say:Kalasi Melasi Tirugudaam, Kalasi Melasi PerugudaamKalasi Melasi Telusukunna, Telivini PoshinchudaamKalasi Melasi Kalata Leka, Chelimito JeevinchudaamLet us move together, let us grow together,Let us foster the knowledge that we have earned to-gether.Let us live together in harmony.Summer Showers in Brindavan 19955Bharath has always produced excellent people in abun-dance—intelligent, courageous, valorous, devoted, strong, andvirtuous. Yet we were conquered by foreigners. Why? Onlybecause there was no unity. For this reason, Bharath had toendure slavery and untold injustice at the hands of invaders.Students must cultivate unity. The reputation and future pros-perity of the nation are hinged on the behavior of students. En-sure that your conduct is proper. All the future leaders ofBharath are among today’s students. “Start early, drive slowly,reach safely.” Imprint the nation’s welfare as the primary goalin your heart, starting in your student days.Students should enter society as men of action. Youshould win victory in selfless endeavors with self-confidence.This is what Mother India needs desperately. Today peopleadvocate new forms of society based on various criteria. We donot need a new social order or a model society. Virtuous boysand girls alone are enough. The nation can progress onlythrough virtuous youth. Establishing various social norms andthen breaking them is only a waste of time.There is only one society, the human society. All ofhumanity is one. If all stand as one and work in unity, trulywhat a glorious nation Bharath will become! Bharath has ninetycrores5 people. If all act united as “plus, plus, plus, plus,plus,” their abilities will add and the country will stand strongas one body.Uproot selfishness and hatred6                  Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995There are many aspects of Bharath’s ancient culturethat you are yet to understand. You must ponder what grandvalues were present in ancient India.In the supremely sacred land of BharathForbearance is the sign of beauty.Of all disciplines,Adherence to truth is the greatest penance.The sweet feeling pervading this land is theMotherly feeling.Character is more precious than life itself.But, alas! Like an elephant unaware of its own strength,Bharathiyas imitate foreign values today,Forgetting their own greatness.What strength! What sacrifice! What adherence todharma and justice! Such a Bharath is ignorant of its own glory.What is the reason? Selfishness and hatred are growing. We canattain peace on the day we destroy selfishness and hatred, notbefore that.First of all, we need to nurture human values. What isthe true mark of a human? Words, heart, and hands must workin unity. “The proper study of mankind is man.” There mustbe unity in thoughts, words, and actions. Today this pure hu-man quality of unity is absent. Education is not just familiaritywith books. Today’s education system must be changed to-tally.Summer Showers in Brindavan 19957Today’s educationTeaches cleverness and guileBut not even a fraction of virtuous behavior.What is the value of even aMillion different kinds of educationDevoid of virtue?What good are ten acres of barren land? A tiny plot offertile land is better. Even a small amount of education ismeaningful when coupled with virtue. Without virtue, Ph.D.upon Ph.D. are of no avail. They are totally useless Ph.D.s!We must learn at least one skill that is useful. What is this“usefulness” we must look for? Ensure that education keepsyou, as well as society, happy. You should be happy andpeaceful. And you should deliver that happiness to society aswell. We are all members of society. We cannot live separatedfrom society even for a moment. Being members of society, wemust desire its welfare before our own. Students! Pursue edu-cation while keeping society’s welfare in view.Janani Janmabhoomischa Svargaadapi Gariyasi—themother and motherland are worth more than heaven itself. Wewere born in Bharath, we grew up in Bharath, we breathe theair of Bharath, and we eat the food of Bharath. But we are un-able to render desperately needed service to Bharath.Students! Bharatha Maata yearns day and night for Herchildren to become virtuous. You must become good citizens,blossom into exemplary students, and earn honor in societyand peace of mind for yourself. This is what Bharatha Maata8                  Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995desires for you. Whatever country you belong to, uphold therespect of your nation.There is only one caste—the caste of humanity.There is only one family—the spiritual family.There is only one language—the language of the heart.The Indweller—source of all powerNames may differ, but the substance is one. Rings aremany, but gold is one. Nationalities are many, but birth is one.Flowers are many, but worship is one. Similarly, God is one.Ekovasi Sarva Bhoota Antaraatma—the One Indweller is inall. That is power; that is electricity. This electricity is presentin every human being. It is this power which sustains life.Students! You know how scientists are inventing won-derful and complex machines today. But they don’t recognizethe one machine that creates all other machines! They developmachines to travel into the depths of the earth, to soar towardthe Moon, to harness solar power and so on. They have in-vented atom bombs, hydrogen bombs, nuclear power, andmany other applications of these energies.But there is one machine that is more valuable and morepowerful than all of man’s inventions—the human body. Butno one attempts to understand its secrets today. As for exter-nal phenomena, yes, scientists actively investigate and experi-ment them. But what about yourself? Examine yourself first!Summer Showers in Brindavan 19959Your power is in the universe and the powers of theuniverse are in you. Students must recognize this truth. Youmay consider someone else as a great person. But there is noone greater than you! All power and potentiality is present inyou. The power of attraction and magnetic energy is in you.Electricity, light, and fire are also inherent to you. X-ray poweris also inside you. In effect, everyone is a computer, a genera-tor, a light source, a radio station ... all in one. All the “news” isin us.Instead of discovering the “news” within ourselves, weabsorb “nuisance” from outside. No, no. What we want isgood, pure news. What is this NEWS? N—North, E—East,W—West, S—South. The Divinity that is present equally eve-rywhere, we must absorb into ourselves. Even among today’sscientists we do not find this concept of North, East, Southand West. Living in the physical world, we use these termswithout much thought. We say that the Sun rises in the Eastand sets in the West. This is completely wrong! How, youmay ask. The Sun neither rises nor sets. We revolve around theSun and perceive the illusion of East and West.Divinity is described as:Nirgunam Niranjanam SanaatanamNitya Niketanam Suddha Buddha MuktaNirmala SvaroopinamAttributeless, stainless, eternal, the final abode,Pure, aware, free, embodiment of sacredness.10                  Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Through such education, we must experience the samepeace that our ancients enjoyed. Never relax your efforts toreach Divinity. In ancient times everyone was peaceful. Now,everybody has tension—from the tiny tot to the old man! Thistension causes temper. Tension and temper are ruining humanqualities. Then how can we expect peace? With an atom bombin one hand, we ask for peace. How is it possible? We will getonly fear, fear, fear.Man has traveled to the Moon. The Moon is cool andpeaceful. Even after traveling to such a cool Moon, the heat ofour hearts is ever on the increase. So, peace is not external toyou. You are the embodiment of truth, love, and peace. Insteadof trying to experience this glorious truth, students pursue thissubject, that subject... In this craze for subjects they have for-gotten the object!Subject and object—both are necessary. Consider a lo-comotive engine. It is huge, complex and worth millions. Yet,without electric current it is just scrap metal. The body is valu-able only with the current of Divinity. You can secure what-ever power you desire when these two join. All power iswithin us. But we misuse the body because we are unable torecognize its potential.PracticeSo don’t misuse anything. Time is most crucial. Oncelost, it cannot be regained. Embark in service activities withoutwasting a moment. All your studies must be applied in serviceto society. Only then will your knowledge improve. What goodSummer Showers in Brindavan 199511are bookish knowledge, superficial knowledge, and generalknowledge? All these are useless. Why? Because they do nothave practical application. What we need today is practicalknowledge. You say the words mysore pak, gulab jamun, jilebi,barfi.6 But can you experience their taste merely by saying thenames? Instead, eat a small piece and you get immediate, directexperience.So plunge into Divinity. What good is it to say “God”over and over again? Today many people memorize the entireBhagavad Gita. They know every verse (sloka) but they seeno end to their sorrow (soka). Why? If you practice just oneverse, that is enough. There are fifty matches in a match-box.But you need only one match stick to build a fire of any size.You don’t need all the fifty sticks.Similarly, you have the five human values inyou—Sathya, Dharma, Shanthi, Prema and Ahimsa. Practiceone of them. That is enough. Prema is the basis. Speak withLove—that is Truth. Perform actions with Love—they areDharma. Think with Love—you experience peace. Inquirewith Love—it is transformed into Ahimsa.There is no place for hatred where Love is present.Darkness has no place where light is present. Students! Wepray: Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamayaa—lead me from darkness tolight. Light these virtues in yourselves and drive away thedarkness of ignorance.Obedience and humility12                  Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Mainly, don’t develop pride and ego on account ofyour youth. This stage of youth is like a passing cloud. Itcomes and goes in a flash. The period of youth must be mademeaningful while it lasts. Respect parents and elders. Developobedience and humility. Without humility, all education is awaste. But today’s students have no idea what humility means.They behave as they please.One with good BEHAVIOR is a BOY.One with good MANNERS is a MAN.One with good DISCIPLINE is a DEVOTEE.You call yourself a boy, but you don’t have behavior.This behavior must start early, when you are a boy. “Startearly, drive slowly, reach safely.” Do not compare your studieswith your behavior. Human values are human values. Do notcompare them with anything because they are permeated withDivinity.So think of spiritual matters at a young age. “Who isGod? How can I see Him? How can I live like a true humanbeing? In what manner can I serve society?” All these issuescan be understood in this Summer Course. This course is notmeant to teach you some new subject. The subject is HumanValues. The name is “Summer Course in Indian Culture andSpirituality.” What is culture? It is sometimes defined as a“way of life”. But Indian Culture cannot be understood eas-ily—it has numerous meanings. Life itself is culture. Our be-havior, moment to moment, is culture.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199513The grief of the motherlandStudents! Born in this sacred land, you must conductyourself so as to increase peace in the country. TodayBharatha Maata is continuously shedding tears, wondering inwhat ways Her children will hurt Her next and bring Her disre-pute! Not just students, but all four stages of life—Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sanyasa7—arecausing grief to Bharatha Maata. No section of society is givingsatisfaction to the country. What a pity that even in spiritual-ity, Bharath is shedding tears!Today, only the outer forms of men are changing butnot their minds. Their dresses change but not their qualities.Where are these people headed? Is there anyone today who isable to recognize and understand the truth about BharathMaata? The Motherland is worrying, “My own children arenot able to recognize Me!”WHAT KIND OF CHILDREN ARE THEY WHO DONOT RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN MOTHER? You must firstrecognize your mother. Then understand the nature of yourfather. The country is the mother and the culture, the father.First of all, protect your motherland and its culture. Patriotismand nationalistic feelings are totally absent in today’s youth.What is meant by a nation? Students think that land, trees andrivers constitute a nation. No, no.Students should understand the principle of their moth-erland. “This is my motherland, this is my mother tongue,”you should declare with pride. If you cannot, you are only adead body! We should be ready to sacrifice even our lives for14                  Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995the sake of the country! “What do I care if the country orworld goes to ruin? I should be happy.”—This is the attitudeof students today. This is gross ignorance. It is only when thecountry is happy that the society can be happy. And you canbe happy only when the society is happy. Students! Considerthe nation first, above everything else. What is our countrycalled? We are called Hindus. What does that mean?Humility + Individuality + Nationality +           Divinity + Unity = HINDU.Only when you have these qualities, are you a trueHindu. Of these, humility is most essential. Pride drives awaythe other four virtues. Without humility, there is no individual,much less, individuality! Humility, humility, humility —this isof utmost importance. Only then can unity result.Work for the motherlandThe next ten days in the Summer Course are valuable.Consider each moment as an era and use this time carefully.Don’t waste life just listening. You must practice what youhave learned. Translation into action should be the chief qualityof our students.The Chief Minister and Education Minister of Karna-taka State are here to give you advice. You must recognize theirexpectations of you. Live up to the high hopes of these guestsand make them happy by demonstrating your exemplary be-havior. The CM has been exerting much for the welfare of theSummer Showers in Brindavan 199515people. He wants to do lasting good to the country. But goodpeople always face hurdles. A pleasure is an interval betweentwo pains. It is natural for good people to experience more ob-stacles because no one even cares to look at worthless people.A beautiful diamond receives more cuts. Gold is burnt in thefurnace. But the more it is burnt, the purer it becomes. Thecuts of a diamond only enhance its beauty. Likewise, troublesonly increase the worth of good people. So we must face trou-bles bravely.Life is a challenge, meet it.Life is a dream, realize it.Life is a game, play it.Life is love, enjoy it.Life is Awareness. Poornamadah Poornamidam Poor-naat Poornam Udachyate—This is Full, that is Full, from theFull emerges the Full. Everything is poornam, full. Your mindmust also be full, not narrow. Practice expansion of love. I con-clude My discourse by hoping and blessing that you under-stand your Motherland, work for Her welfare and become idealexamples.(Bhagavan asked all to rise. Upon His instruction, thenational anthem of India, “Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka JayaHe,” was sung.)

Science and SpiritualitySvabhode Naanyabodhe ChaBodha Roopa AtmanahSva Deepenya Deepe ChaYadaasvaatma PrakaashateTo search for a flame,Another light is not required.To know the omnipresent, effulgent AtmaAnother type of knowledge is not required.Students!You do not need a flame to find another flame. In thesame way, it is ignorance and foolishness to search for the self-effulgent, omnipresent Atma using other forms of knowledge.No one tries to search for himself in the world outside. In thesame way, when you are the Atma, is it not plain ignorance tolook for the Atma elsewhere? Such pure teachings on the Atmahave been propagated by Bharath since ancient times, era afterera.Bharath—the birthplace of spiritualityBharath is the birthplace of spirituality and dharma.Peace and nonviolence also took birth in Bharath. The searchfor Truth done in Bharath has not been done anywhere else.This land is the birthplace of the Sapta Rishis.1 This is thecountry in which the first poet, Valmiki,2 and the classifier ofthe Vedas, Vyasa3, took birth. This is the supremely sacredland of dharma in which Krishna taught the Bhagavad Gita.This is Rama’s kingdom. This is the soil on which Buddha wasborn. Bharath has always been replete with minds inquiringinto the Truth, hands engaged in dharma, and hearts immersedin the Lord.18 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Devotion has no distinctions of caste, age, and language.It is easy for everyone to contemplate on God. God is as es-sential for the mind as food is for the body. In the devotion ofBharathiyas we sometimes find situations bordering on the ab-surd. But spiritual feelings and love are the undercurrents evenin this seemingly senseless behavior. A student prays to Godto do well in exams. A man prays to God to win a court case.Why go that far? People pray even to secure a seat in a bus! Inthis way, Bharathiyas depend on God from the smallest to thebiggest things. This may be called divine madness. Some call itfoolishness. Whatever anyone may say, each is entitled to theirown hunger, their own faith, their own kind of madness. Noone has the right to deny another’s faith.But certain foundations are necessary even for faith.The presence of the groom doesn’t mean that the marriage isdone. Having money does not imply that you can run a busi-ness. Some additional know-how is required. You cannot beconsidered a writer by knowing the alphabet. Only one whounderstands meanings of words can be an author. Similarly,you cannot recognize God with worldly knowledge. Spiritualknowledge is essential. To acquire it, inquire into the Truth.Scientific investigations into the truthEveryone must understand the universe and the natureof the individual souls living in it. Those who recognize the se-crets of the Cosmos and of the beings living in it can under-stand the nature of Divinity. Since ancient times, men of wis-dom have investigated into Nature. The astronomer Galileo dis-covered many facts about the universe. The Earth revolves at aSummer Showers in Brindavan 199519speed of 18,500 miles per second. It circles the Sun once ayear. “Who is turning the Earth? Why does it revolve? What isthe basis for its revolution?” asked Galileo. He found that theparabola is the basis of motion.If there is such a basis for even small objects, theremust be a significance to the Earth’s movement as well. Onceupon a time the Earth was hot. Then it took millions of yearsto cool down. Why should the burning planet revolve? Galileopondered the answer to this question. Rotation causes day andnight, which provide opportunities for men to undertake ac-tion. Revolution produces seasons, which are responsible forrain, harvest, and food. Every act of God, big or small, is forthe good for mankind. There is a hidden power running every-thing. Galileo recognized it and called it God. Therefore, a natu-ral scientist recognized this unchanging power.That which is present always is Truth. Within thisTruth we find both worldly and spiritual knowledge. It is notpossible for anyone to know this power through any means.To know the unchanging power behind Nature is to know God.This is what Galileo finally concluded.Einstein, the father of modern science, talked about theinterchangeability of matter and energy. He said that thesecould neither be created nor destroyed. But energy may changeforms. How? Magnetic energy can be turned into electricity,electricity into atomic power, atomic power into light and lightinto heat. Students should recognize a small fact. You can cre-ate water by combining hydrogen and oxygen. But who createdhydrogen and oxygen? Water is the effect, hydrogen and oxy-20 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995gen are the causes. Nothing can exist without a cause. The ef-fect gradually changes. That which changes is science. Thechangeless cause is spirituality.Live human valuesWe say “culture and spirituality”. We came to knowthis morning that culture is a “way of life”. It means heritage.Spirituality is necessary for transformation. What is spiritual-ity? We consider only worship and good actions to be spiritu-ality. But in truth:Spirituality = Spirit of Love.Science = Split of Love.“Split of Love” changes but the “Spirit of Love” ispermanent. Culture has love as its basis. No love means no cul-ture. Culture and spirituality really mean the power of love.This changeless power cannot be destroyed. This power couldbe God, said Einstein, adding that nothing may be spoken ofwith equal certainty.People asked Buddha if he understood Divinity. Bud-dha was silent on the existence of God. He said, “It is a wasteof time to argue about an unknowable subject like Divinity,which is beyond the mind.” Yatho Vaacho Nivartante ApraapyaManasaa Sahaa—From where words and thoughts return, un-able to grasp anything, That is Divinity. “For me, Sathya,Dharma, and Ahimsa are equivalent to Brahma, Vishnu, andShiva,” he said.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199521Truth and dharma are the highest. Follow them andpractice ahimsa in your life. This is true spiritual effort, Bud-dha said. There is no God higher than Truth. For this reason,Vedas say, Sathyam Vada, Dharmam Chara—speak the truthand uphold righteousness. God is present wherever these areupheld. Vashishta said, “Ramo Vigrahavaan Dharmah”—Rama is the very embodiment of dharma—because Ramanever spoke a lie and always stuck to the path of dharma. Hewalked barefoot in forests and sacrificed everything for thesake of righteousness. To uphold a promise given by His fa-ther, He took great burdens upon Himself. Without ever fal-tering, Rama adhered unflinchingly to sathya and dharma. Thatis why He is the embodiment of Divinity.Even in this Kali Yuga people went to RamakrishnaParamahamsa and asked him if he had seen God. Yes, he re-plied. In what form, they asked. Ramakrishna said, “Just as Isee you, I have seen God.” When asked how it was possible, heexplained, “With yearning. You strive for wealth and family.You cry for small and big things. Have you ever cried forGod?”Yaa Chintaa Bhuvi Putra Mitra Bharanau VyaapaaraSambhaashaneYaa Chintaa Dhana Dhaanya Bhoga Yashase Laabhe Sa-daa JaayateSaa Chintaa Bhuvi Nanda Nandana Pada Dvand-vaaravinde KshaneKaa Chintaa Yamaraaja Bhima Sadana Dvaara PrayaaniPrabho.You cry for wife, children, friends,22 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Wealth, business, pleasures, name and fame.But if you yearn for Krishna’s Lotus Feet even for a mo-ment,You can easily cross the terrible doors of Death.If you desire God, work for Him. Then God will easilycome within your grasp. You struggle for worldly benefits butexpect God’s Vision. With such hypocrisy you can never ac-quire God.”Invisible causes and visible manifestationsThese days scientists, atheists and argumentative peo-ple demand direct perception of God. “I must see with myeyes, touch with my hands, and taste with my tongue to be-lieve. How can I believe in something I cannot see, touch ortaste?” they question. With such arguments scientists deridedevotees as fools. Truly, no one is more foolish than these sci-entists.Why? An example: You see a man who is 5'6" tall,weighs 63kg, and is bald. These are all direct perceptions. Arethey true? Definitely. But they are truths only for the externalvision. The man also has qualities like sacrifice, kindness, anddetermination that cannot be touched or measured. Even if youcut the man into pieces, these qualities are not visible! So doyou deny their existence? In fact, the man exists only due tothese qualities. The invisible qualities are the basis for the visi-ble attributes.You say only what is seen is true, nothing else. Youhave accumulated past karma, which makes you suffer, but canSummer Showers in Brindavan 199523you see it? It is foolishness to deny what is not visible or tan-gible. You see a tree with branches. Scientists see the fruits,branches, and leaves, which are readily visible. But spiritualityperceives the unseen roots. Without roots how can you havebranches? Which are more important, branches or roots? In thesame way, an invisible force is the foundation for the visibleuniverse. We see and experience this world only by the powerof that force.A few more examples. Love and fragrance have no form,but we experience them. Can they be denied because they areinvisible or intangible? So why do we believe in them? It is be-cause even invisible entities have visible or tangible manifesta-tions.Love has no form, but the Mother, who gives Love, hasa form. Fragrance has no form, but the fragrant flower has aform. Bliss has no form, but God, whose Nature is Bliss, has aform!Bhaava Roopam—the Form of GodWhat is this form of God? It is unattainable, beyondcomprehension. It can be anything. For example, what is theform of wind or water? You can see water and feel wind butthey have no forms. When do they acquire forms? When youfill air in a balloon, it assumes the corresponding form. Wateracquires the form of its container.In the same way, the formless God assumes the formcherished by the devotee. The devotee’s feeling itself is theform of God. This has been called bhaava-roopam4 in our24 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995scriptures. To know this form of God, meditation is recom-mended. God appears as the embodiment of whatever feelingsthe devotee meditates upon. If we think of God as benevolent,He appears so. If we think of Him as destructive, that is howHe appears. So, all forms of God are dependent on your feel-ing. It is not possible to limit Divinity as being “this” or “that.”Sarvatah Paani Paadam, Thath Sarvatokshi     Siro MukhamSarvatah Srutimal Loke, Sarvamaavritya     Tishtati5With hands, feet, eyes, heads, mouth,And ears pervading everything,He permeates all worlds.God is everywhere as energy. This is what scientistscall atomic energy. But even the atom can be subdivided. Thereis nothing in this world without a form. Even Karnataka andAndhra Pradesh6 have forms, seen in a map. That is why an-cient Hindus worshipped Mother Earth as a manifestation ofDivinity. But modern scientists ridicule this practice.Scientists question: Earth is just soil and rock. Why pray to it?Our ancients explain: Soil gives us food. The Sun causes rain,day and night. All these are necessary for life. It is our culture toworship those whose benevolence sustains us. Nothing can ex-ist without the five. Elements —earth, water, sky, fire andether. So what is wrong in praying to them?Summer Showers in Brindavan 199525Scientists say: Fine, the five elements are okay. But why prayto a stone idol? How can it be God?The ancients reply: God is everywhere! Why not worship Himin the rock?Scientists argue: But the rock has no awareness.Here students should realize an important point. On the15th of August7, we raise our national flag aloft. We salute it.Why? It is just a piece of cloth, composed of threads. It has noqualities or awareness. It flutters with the wind and lies limp instill air. What virtues of the flag make it worthy of respect? Itis a symbol of independence won after arduous struggle. Simi-larly, although divine Consciousness is everywhere, we needsigns and symbols to remind us of it.Atheism simply cannot exist when we inquire in thismanner. Dhanamoolam Idam Jagat—Today the world re-volves around money. Sometimes when you drop a currencynote on the ground by mistake, you touch it to your eyes as amark of respect. Why? The currency is only bamboo and grasspulp, isn’t it? What awareness or individuality does it have?None. Then why do you honor it? Not just devotees, atheistsalso worship money! Do atheists say, “No, thank you, I donot want money”? No, atheists also desire it! They honor theseal of the Reserve Bank, which makes the paper valuable.Similarly you display your grandfather’s photo and garland itwhen he passes away. Does your grandfather still exist in the26 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995photo? No, the photo is only paper pulp. So why do you re-spect it? It is his symbol.Yes, this is rock. But the rock is a symbol of the omni-present God. The bhaava-roopam of the devotee is concen-trated in the rock! Thus, Hindus worship not rocks, but God inrocks, in the Earth and in idols. You may ignore some practicesif you wish, but no one has the right to condemn or weakenanother’s faith. Each one is entitled to his own faith. Just asone person’s breathing (shvaasam) cannot be substituted foranother person, one’s faith (vishvaasam) is personal also.Absolute truth, relative truth, and untruthSuch search for the Truth is described in the Vedas.What does it mean to search for the Truth? The Truth is eve-rywhere, so it is meaningless to search for it, some argue. Anexample. You see your mother, daughter, sister, wife, andmother-in-law with your eyes. The eyes that see are the same.Now, the feeling used in each case is the “search.” Having eyesis not enough. You must ask yourself, “How do I look at mymother?” The answer: With motherly feeling. This is the“search for the Truth”. Just because the eyes are one and thesame, can you look upon everyone with the same outlook?The vision is the same but the underlying feelings aredifferent. In the same way, all our senses are one but each hasits own faculties and limits. The search for the Truth meansdiscriminating between what is sathyam (Truth), nijam (relativetruth or fact), and asathyam (untruth).Summer Showers in Brindavan 199527What is the difference between a relative truth and theTruth? There is a vast difference. Students, you know theEarth is a globe. But the ground near your house is flat. Theflatness is relative truth. That is how you see it. But when yousearch for the Truth, it turns out to be a globe. So, a relativetruth is really an untruth perceived to be the Truth. You see aman wearing a suit. That is today’s truth. Tomorrow he mightwear a dhoti.8 What is present today but absent tomorrow isrelative truth. The unchanging Truth is ever true. That is Di-vinity.Untruth is opposed to both Truth and relative truth.What is untruth? To see something and say otherwise is false-hood. In darkness you see a rope and call it a snake. That isdelusion born of improper discrimination. You jumped to aconclusion. Shine a torch and you will realize it is a rope. Toconsider the rope as a snake is illusion.In this manner, spirituality conceals many subtle se-crets. This has been called sathya-rahasyam—Secret of Truth.Why should the Truth be called “secret”? Because it is veiledto the unripe intellect and must be churned from effort. Thus,Vedas say, Ekam Sath, Vipraah Bahudaa Vadant i—Truth isone, but sages interpret it in many ways. Vedas also say, EkamEva Adviteeyam Brahma—God is One, not many. The Vedasprove these truths in a beautiful manner.See God through loveScientists have also come across divine Power in theirexperiments. They acknowledge the existence of a changelesspower without calling it “God”. Whatever name they may use,28 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995they cannot change the substance. There is water in this tum-bler. The Telugu man calls it neeru, the Tamil man says tanni,the Hindi man calls it paani, and the Englishman, water. Thenames change, not the water. People also worship God incountless names and forms depending on their personal atti-tudes. But only One God exists.The world cannot exist without God. You say that thiscloth is a collection of threads, which, in turn, are nothing butcotton. But the cloth, threads, and cotton are one and the same.Apply such logic in spiritual inquiry as well.But to believe blindly without inquiry is also great de-votion because it is born of total faith. The infant places un-questionable faith in the mother and believes whatever themother says. This cannot be called foolishness. Even Jesussaid, “How happy I would be if I could be an innocent child fora moment every day!” Meaning, we must have the innocence ofinfants. We shouldn’t nurture manipulation, deceit, and se-crecy. With straightforwardness, we achieve purity, and Truthis present within purity. But today, staying aloof from suchpurity, we trust that polluted conduct pays.Students! Do not entertain frivolous talk and shallowopinions in matters concerning Divinity. What scientists knowtoday is close to nothing. You must understand this well.Knowledge is small but the exhibition is gargantuan. Those whoknow the Truth are calm and silent. The pot full of water issteady while the half-full pot rocks back and forth noisily.Those who argue are half-full pots.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199529To be a scientist, first control your senses and grow inLove. “God is Love, Love is God, Live in Love.” Love cannotbe bought or sold. No company manufactures and suppliesLove. The only machine that generates Love is within us—theheart. Heart is called hridaya. That which is full of compassion(daya) alone is a hridaya. But modern hearts are stones, withno traces of kindness. Such hearts cannot be called humanhearts. No, no. God is the resident of the heart. A heart withcompassion is the temple of God. Develop compassion andyou will perceive God in your heart. If we look only outside,we are confused. What we see outside must be seen inside aswell. The Vedas say, Antar Bahischatat-sarva Vyaapya Nara-yana Sthitah—Narayana is present inside, outside ... every-where.Creation speaks of the CreatorDivinity is everywhere. In every step, in every breath,there is God. In every syllable you utter, God is present. Thatis Divinity in the form of speech. Therefore, God is describedas Sabda Brahma Mayi, Charaachara Mayi—Manifestation ofsound, pervading sentient and non-sentient things.A small example. Someone is singing in a radio stationin Delhi. When we power the radio here, we hear that song. Sois it present everywhere or not? Radio waves are present eve-rywhere. They are manifestations of divine Power, as are mag-netic energy, atomic energy, light, and heat.Following such inquiry, we realize that God’s creationhas endless secrets. In Bharath alone there are 900 million peo-ple. The world has 5.8 billion people. It was 5 billion sometime30 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995ago but now it has grown by 800 million. With growth inpopulation, there is growth in sin as well. Now, among thesemillions, are any two persons identical? Who can understandsuch mysteries? Even among twins there are differences. Theyare not made from a mold. Only God could create such a won-derful cosmos.The Bhagavatham says that the stories and deeds ofGod are beyond comprehension. No one can understand Hissports, but listening to them generates Bliss in the heart andgrants immortality. Such is the nature of Divinity.Consider radio waves transmitted from Delhi, Banga-lore, Madras, Calcutta, Sri Lanka, even America. No two wavesmingle. What a mystery! There is no confusion between themillions of waves in the air. When does the confusion arise?Only when we do not tune into the correct station. This “tun-ing” is meditation. Tune your mind with concentration to re-ceive the “news,” namely, divine Vision. When the mind is di-vergent, the reception is unclear or meaningless.The Sun shines over a pond. The water has ripples dueto wind. The Sun appears unsteady in the pond. But in reality,only the image wavers, not the Sun. The waves in your mindmake you perceive Divinity in various moods, names, forms.But Divinity in One. It is not Divinity but only your feelingsthat change with time. Meditation is the process of uniting themind’s scattered thoughts.Everyone can see diversity in unity. We must see unityin diversity, the underlying principle, the Atma. How? Here area plate, a tumbler and a spoon. Names and forms are different.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199531The value of each object is also different. But the value of silveris the same, whether in the plate, tumbler or spoon. Divinityhas assumed the name and form of every single entity in crea-tion. You may respect and value one person and ridicule an-other. These are attitudes based on the behavior of those per-sons. But the Atma Principle is One.Do your dutyMud is found all over, so it has no value. But gold hasgreat value. Why? It is difficult to obtain. In the same way, aman with a pure heart is given great respect. His actions carryweight. A happy life and good reputation depend on your ac-tions, nothing else. To scale the heights of greatness, one mustengage in sacred deeds. Human life is indeed very valuable. Thefirst student speaker today told you: “Men are more valuablethan all the wealth of the world.” Who gives value to gold anddiamonds? Man alone. Why do you pay huge amount ofmoney for a tiny plot of land in the city? Only because that’sthe value given to it by man. Unfortunately, the man who val-ues everything does not value himself today! This is becausehuman values are disregarded.Realize that the body has no value. Everyone has abody composed of the five elements. The body becomesmeaningful only when sanctified with noble actions and ideals.For example, a glass jar can preserve savories and pickles formany months. But if you eat these pickles, they cannot be pre-served by the body even for a few hours! So the glass jar ismuch better than this body!32 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Remember: Your respect in society depends not onlooks, personality, or wealth but only on behavior. If you ad-here to virtue, you are automatically honored. You do not needto ask for respect. Therefore:Adugakuve O Manasa!Adugu Koladi Adi Adugunu PadunaniAdugakunna Pani VadigaanagunaniAdugani Sabarini Aadarinchade!Do not ask, O Mind!The more you ask, the lower it is placed.Without asking, the task proceeds quickly.Sabari, who never asked, was showered with Grace!An example: Dasharatha, the father of Rama, cried forRama repeatedly and begged Him to stay near. But poorDasharatha died a broken-hearted man, separated from Rama.On the other hand, Jatayu did not beg Rama for favors. He didhis duty, to the extent that he sacrificed his life trying to saveSita Devi. Even in his last moments, Jatayu worried only aboutRama’s troubles. As a result, Rama rested Jatayu on His thighand performed his funeral rites like a son.Many sages begged Rama for favors and waited for Himin their hermitages. Instead of rewarding them, Rama chose togo to Sabari. Sabari didn’t ask Him anything directly but onlythrough her heart. God knows what to give to whom, when,where, and how. Therefore, do your duty and God’s Grace willoverflow, unasked.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199533We must pose five questions to everything: who,where, why, when and how. If you simply overwhelm God inyour flood of desires without asking yourself these questions,do you think God will fulfill your wishes? You should knowwhen, where, how, and what to ask of God. Cultivate the in-tellect to recognize the right time and situation for the fulfill-ment of desires. This discrimination is called Constant Inte-grated Awareness or Prajnaanam Brahma.You and God are OneThe Vedas consist of great declarations: PrajnaanamBrahma. Aham Brahmaasmi. Ayam Atma Brahma. What ismeant by Ayam Atma Brahma? Simply, “I am Atma, I amBrahma.” Scholars give elaborate interpretations but the mean-ing is simply, “I am Atma.” You and Atma are not different, butare one and the same.When you speak, you must weigh each word carefully.What you say, demonstrate in action. Have faith in the conceptfirst, then practice it.Some time ago, Swami asked a college boy, “Who areyou?” The boy recollected that Swami teaches Ayam AtmaBrahma. He replied, “I and You are One, Swami.” Swami said,“It seems your intellect has really blossomed today! Are youreally the same as Swami?” He said, “Yes, Swami, You and Iare the same.” “Then go outside and give darshan to the devo-tees,” I said! Who would look at him if he went to give dar-shan? [laughter] But if faith is deep, God will definitely appearthrough you as well. People only talk without practicing. “Theproper study of mankind is man.” To give credence to your34 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995words, put them into action. Practice grants experience. Onlythen will you realize the Truth.The BhagavathamStudents! Your Vice-chancellor requested today that Iexplain the Bhagavatham to you. It is necessary for studentsto understand this scripture, its secrets, and the nature of thechild Krishna. Bhagavatham rhymes with baagavutam, whichmeans, “we will improve.”9 By listening to it, we will becomebetter persons, permeated with devotion and wisdom. TheBhagavatham contains the fruits of all spiritual practices.The word Bhagavatamu10 has five syllables: BHA stands for Bhakti (Devotion)GA Gnannam (Wisdom)VAVairagyam (Detachment)TATatwam (Nature)MUMukti (Liberation)Therefore, the Bhagavatham is the gist of all scripturesand texts, the goal of all paths, the essence of all fruits.From tomorrow I have decided to dole out to you all,cool helpings of the Bhagavatham. Don’t just listen to it. Isyour hunger satisfied by listening to the names of foods? No,eating alone fills the stomach.Therefore, I do not ask you to listen to Bhagavatham,but to eat it. You are future citizens of this country. Your vir-tue alone will guarantee progress in the nation.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199535Help ever, hurt neverEmbodiments of Love! Make your hearts pure withselfless actions and serve society. Don’t indulge in wastefuldeeds and pollute your mind. First understand what it means tobe human and then progress towards Divinity. I told you in themorning how scientists are developing many complex ma-chines. They don’t recognize the one machine that invents allmachines: the human body. They ask, “Who are you?” butnever, “Who am I?” They spend all their time discussing othersinstead of themselves. Self-inquiry is very essential. It makeseverything else easy to understand. Embodiments of Love! In these ten days you will lis-ten to the words of elders. It is not possible to remember eve-rything that you hear here. Vyasa wrote eighteen Puranas,which were elaborate texts. They were so voluminous that theycould possibly be placed under the head as pillows but not in-side the head! Vyasa pondered the solution to this problem. Hefinally concluded and propagated that all Puranas could becondensed into two teachings: “Help Ever, Hurt Never.”Of all that you hear in this Summer Course, practiceone or two teachings. Do not hurt anyone. If you cannot help,stay away—that itself is a great help. Remember God always.Consider yourself as a form of God, and you will gradually re-alize your Divinity.[Bhagavan concluded with the bhajan “Hari BhajanaBina Sukha Shanthi Nahi”.]

It is also said, BhaagavataanaamIdam Bhagavatham —Bhagavatham describes the lives ofdevotees. Scholars have interpreted this scripture based ontheir individual outlooks. Truly, the Bhagavatham illustratesthe intimate relation between God and His devotees. It is thebridge between the Lord and devotees. Four requisites are ab-solutely essential to understand and practice the message of theBhagavatham.Tyaja Durjana SamsargamFirst, give up bad company. Bad company is not justbad people. Bad thoughts must also be abandoned. Feelingsacquire form as actions. There should be no hesitation in re-nouncing bad company. Why? Bad company can cause even adevotee to become an atheist and a renunciant to become at-tached. “Tell me your company and I shall tell you what youare.” The Bhagavatham states that a poisonous snake is muchmore desirable than bad company! Why? A snake bites onceand leaves; but a wicked person bites repeatedly, day and38 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995night. The joy of malicious people lies in violence, in makingothers cry. They cannot even sleep peacefully without criti-cizing or harming someone! The human mind is impressionableand assumes the attitudes of one’s associates. In the Mahab-haratha, the characters Duryodhana, Dussashana, Sakuni, andKarna are called dushta chatushtayam—four wicked ones.Karna was inherently noble but was corrupted by the otherthree. Hence, the sooner we distance ourselves from negativepeople, the sooner we will perceive Divinity within our hearts.Bhaja Sadhu SamaagamamIt is not enough to merely leave bad company. Thecompany of the wise and pious is necessary. We must cultivatefriendship with people of compassion and integrity and followtheir example to realize the value of human life. But even thesetwo are not enough.Kuru Punyam AhoraatramThird, perform sacred deeds day and night, ceaselessly.Vyasa said, Paropakaarah Punyaaya Paapaaya Parape-edanam —helping others is merit, harming others is sin. Whatis paropakaaram? People take it to mean para (others) +upakaaram (favor) = helping others. But this limited, worldlymeaning is not what Vyasa had in mind. Para (principle be-yond the world) + upa (near) + kara (to go) = Paropakaara.Therefore, true merit is to be in proximity to the Atma. To de-velop nearness to the Bhagavatham, to devotees, and to theLord is the highest merit. This must be followed day and night.Smara Nityam AnityataamSummer Showers in Brindavan 199539Discriminate between the ephemeral and the eternal.Discrimination is essential in every action. “Is it good or bad,right or wrong?” Such inquiry must be exercised to the limit ofour intellectual capacity. First discriminate, then follow what isgood. What is meant by “good”? Good means eternal. Give upthe transient.It is only when we cultivate these four attributes thatwe can understand the significance and secrets of the Bha-gavatham.Devaki and VasudevaSoora was the Lord of the Yadava dynasty. The term“Yadava” is derived from Yadu, the son of King Yayati, whowas Soora’s ancestor. “Yadava” means “descendant of Yadu.”Soora divided his kingdom into two parts: Mathura andSoorasena. His older son, Ugrasena, ruled Mathura. Kamsa wasUgrasena’s son. Soora’s second son, Devaka, ruled Soorasena.Devaki was his daughter.Kamsa did not have any siblings, so he consideredDevaki as his own little sister. Kamsa’s affection for Devakiwas truly boundless. To him, she was his second life. In duecourse, the marriage of Devaki was finalized with Vasudeva,the son of Soora. Kamsa took active part in the marriage ar-rangements and offered many ornaments, horses and elephantsto the couple with love.This affectionate Kamsa later turned into a cruel hater.Why? Only due to selfishness. There are such demons eventoday who would harm their own mother, father, brother, or40 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995friend for the fulfillment of their desires! If possible, we shouldteach wisdom to such people. We should dissociate from suchsinners who hold self-interest highest.Kamsa placed the couple in a chariot and started guidingit towards the village of Vasudeva. It was a long and joyousprocession. Suddenly they heard a voice from the sky:“Kamsa, you fool! The woman in your chariot will cause yourdeath! Her eighth son will be your destroyer.” Kamsa immedi-ately jumped down, caught hold of Devaki’s hair, and draggedher down. He lifted his sword with his right hand. Everyonewas terrified. Vasudeva intervened, “Kamsa, you have takenbirth in a great dynasty. You will stain its glory by this ignobleact. You will incur the heinous sin of killing a woman. How canyou do this to your dearest sister who you loved more thanyourself? Calm down. Inquire. Death follows birth like nightfollows day. Everyone is bound to die one day or the other.Not even an hour has passed since our marriage! Why kill thispure lady for what is inevitable?”Kamsa was harsh, “My life is in danger due to her. Shecannot go free!” Vasudeva quickly thought of a strategy to saveDevaki till the birth of her children. He said, “Devaki herselfposes no danger to you, it is only her eighth child. I will deliverevery child to you as it is born. Leave her alone.” Kamsa con-sidered the proposal and was satisfied. He let go of Devaki andwalked back to his palace.The newly-weds, who were supposed to reach home injoy, were drowned in tears. From the very first day of theirmarriage they were immersed in grief! Why? It was the directSummer Showers in Brindavan 199541result of associating with bad company in the form of Kamsa.Evil in a person is not always visible. It is seen only when itmanifests in actions.Kamsa’s crueltyIn due course the first child, a girl, was born. Noble andvirtuous souls never break their promises, no matter what theprice. They alone qualify to be called true humans. Kamsa wasa demon. People of his category must be avoided. And truemen like Vasudeva should be befriended. Only vile peoplemake promises in time of need and conveniently forget themlater. There is no sin greater than reneging on your word. Thisis what Emperor Bali also told his guru, Sukracharya.1 The onewho forgets promises is a great sinner.Vasudeva was definitely not such a person. To himtruth was the highest penance. He carried his child to Kamsa.He upheld his word. Kamsa was struck by Vasudeva’s nobil-ity. He thought, “My brother-in-law kept his word even insuch an extreme situation. Such purity and adherence to truthare absent in me.” Vasudeva’s integrity changed the cruel mindof Kamsa. He told Vasudeva, “Your truthfulness will alwaysprotect you” and returned the baby. Why? Kamsa knew thathis enemy was the eighth child, not the first. Vasudeva retracedhis steps with the child in his arms.Then Sage Narada, the son of Brahma, arrived atKamsa’s palace. He asked Kamsa, “How are you, your sub-jects, and kingdom?” as per formality. Then he began talkingabout the issue at hand. “Kamsa! Don’t you know the realityof the Yadavas? They are divine beings born on Earth to herald42 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995the Avatar. The Lord is destined to be your killer. You returnedthe first child to Vasudeva without grasping the situation in itsentirety. No one can fathom the intentions of God. What ismeant by the eighth child? The first becomes the eighth if youcount backward starting at eight! If counting begins with two,the second becomes the eighth. In this manner, all eight birthscan qualify as the eighth! This is a Divine mystery.”After sowing this doubt in Kamsa’s mind, Naradacalmly departed. The spark ignited by Narada grew into a rag-ing fire in Kamsa’s heart. His eyes crimson with fury, Kamsaran to Vasudeva’s house. Devaki was feeding her child. Kamsawrenched the baby away by its leg and beheaded it with hissword.There is no limit to the wretchedness of demonic peo-ple! They have no trace of compassion! They cultivate all in-human traits and display them in cruelty. Six children weredone away with in this manner. Devaki and Vasudeva wit-nessed these horrific crimes and suffered terribly. But so didKamsa. Ever since Kamsa paid heed to Narada’s words, he lostinterest in food and sleep. He became weaker and weaker.In this situation, Jarasandha, the King of Magadha,came to Mathura and gave his daughters in marriage to Kamsa.After his marriage, Kamsa grew stronger owing to the supportof Jarasandha and his allies. He used his new-found strength inacts of greater cruelty. Narada had said that the Yadavas wereheavenly beings in human form. Kamsa began harassing theYadavas. Not able to bear his crimes, people fled to neighboringSummer Showers in Brindavan 199543kingdoms as refugees. Some people continued to stay and actas per Kamsa’s wishes, having no other option.We must try to understand the nature of Divinity. Godalways assumes human forms. Why? Only for the upliftmentof mankind. Only then can men feel intimate kinship with Him.Therefore, an Avatar has both Divine and Human traits. Whenin human form, the Divine sometimes behaves like an ordinaryman and acts as if He knows nothing. Devotees get misled byHis acting and think, “He seems quite plain. How can He beGod?” People concentrate on His human qualities and forgetHis Divinity. “He eats with us, walks with us, talks with us.What is special about Him?” they say. That is why they aresurprised by miracles. This happens in the case of every Ava-tar.Many sages of the forest worshipped Rama as LordNarayana and welcomed him to their hermitages. But Rama al-ways feigned ignorance by saying, “Am I Narayana? I did notknow that. I am only Rama, the son of Dasharatha. I am an or-dinary man. Please don’t embarrass me.” Even great sages weredeceived by His pretense! No one can comprehend God’s na-ture.Sri Krishna AvatarAs time passed God summoned Maya Shakthi.2 Devakihad conceived her seventh child. God ensured that everythingwas progressing according to His master plan. Vasudeva had awife, Rohini, prior to Devaki. She was at Nanda’s place tempo-rarily, for fear of Kamsa. The Lord instructed Maya to transferDevaki’s seventh child into the womb of Rohini. And Maya44 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Herself entered into the womb of Yasoda, the wife of Nanda.This seventh child, the incarnation of Adisesha,3 was namedBalarama. That is why Balarama is also called Sankarshana,meaning “transferred”. The Lord told Maya, “I will Myselfenter Devaki’s womb as her eighth child.”Whenever cruelty and unrighteousness reach intolerableproportions, God incarnates on Earth and destroys wrong-doers. God Himself steps into the world. Why? Couldn’t Hesend His deputies to complete the task? If two people arequarreling on the road, a constable is enough to separate them.When the crowd builds, the sub-inspector arrives. But if a ma-jor riot begins, the inspector-general himself is required to con-trol it. The remedy must suit the severity of the situation. To-day the world is boiling in gross unrighteousness. People suf-fered likewise under Kamsa’s policies. Everyone felt as if hewas in the midst of a fire. “What will happen next? Will I liveto see tomorrow?” Such were the constant fears in people’sminds.God decided to incarnate to destroy the cruel and self-ish Kamsa. Every Avatar has two causes: prayers of devoteesand atrocities of wicked people. The unity of these two is es-sential for an Avatar. An example. Prahlada remembered thename of Hari without interruption. But Hiranya Kashyapa, hisfather, was a hater of Hari. Prahlada’s love and HiranyaKashyapa’s hatred combined to result in Narasimha Avatar.As long as Prahlada chanted Om Namo Narayanaya, the Lordprotected him. In what situations was he protected? When hecould not endure the atrocities of his father. Thus, Hiranya’scrimes became Prahlada’s protection! Hiranya’s hatred made itSummer Showers in Brindavan 199545possible for Prahlada to acquire proximity to the Lord. Thesetwo factors must be present for every Avatar’s advent: wick-edness and devotion. In this way, Divine plans conceal subtlesecrets.The Avatar manifested. The Divine effulgence of thechild illuminated the surroundings. Vasudeva and Devakibowed to the child. How did they know? They were told ear-lier that God would incarnate as their son. The Lord had ap-peared to them in a dream the previous night and said, “I willtake birth from your womb at dawn.” They knew He was God.Yet they worried for His safety if Kamsa stormed in! This isMaya, delusion! If the baby was God, does His protection liein their hands? They were God’s parents and yet, full of fear.See, the games which Maya plays on people’s minds!They were in a jail. Their hands and feet were shackledwith chains. The doors to the jail were made of heavy iron. Theguards were ferocious demons. The Lord had instructedVasudeva to take Him out. How was this to be done? Vasudevaplaced the Lord in a small basket and wondered how to fulfillthe command. In a trice, the chains came loose. The doors flewopen. It was three o’clock in the morning. The gatekeeperswere fast asleep. No one else was around. Vasudeva quietlywalked out of the dungeon. As he proceeded, there was a tre-mendous downpour of rain—a sign of the intense joy and pu-rity of the occasion. Even the clouds were ecstatic at the DivineAdvent.Balancing the basket on his head, Vasudeva walked inthe direction of Gokula. But River Yamuna flowed across his46 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995path. When God Himself walks, what can obstruct Him?Adisesha also came there and the river parted for them to pro-ceed. At that moment Maya was born to Yasoda. Everyonewas asleep at Gokula also. Vasudeva switched the babies andreturned. It was all done according to Divine instructions. Butnobody believes this today. Nobody can understand God’splans. The sports of God are beyond all comprehension.Even the gopikas4 tried to fathom Krishna in variousways, only to meet with failure. Then they told Him,“Krishna! You are smaller than an atom, vaster than the uni-verse. You are present as the witness in all 8,400,000 speciesof living beings. How, then, can it be possible to know You?”There is nothing God’s Will cannot accomplish. He can turnmud into diamonds and diamonds into mud, earth into sky andsky into Earth. We must place full trust in Divine power. Tothose with such faith, God reveals the Truth about Himself.In keeping with God’s command, Vasudeva placed theLord next to Yashoda’s sleeping form and returned to Mathurawith the girl. God’s ways are so mysterious! Only afterVasudeva returned and placed the girl in Devaki’s arms did thejail guards wake up. The baby girl cried out loudly. Kamsa wasinformed of the EIGHTH BIRTH! Kamsa was not sleeping,anyway. He was in constant torment, eager for news from thejail. Sinners always suffer for their actions in this manner.Kamsa stormed in and, as usual, attempted to behead the babygirl. But the baby slipped out of his grasp and flew upward,transformed and shone in Her full glory as Yoga Maya. She ex-claimed, “Fool! You don’t know God’s Will! Your vanquishersurvives elsewhere. It is impossible to harm Him. RecognizeSummer Showers in Brindavan 199547this truth. Vinaasha Kaale Vipareeta Buddhi—a contorted in-tellect is a sign of approaching doom. You cannot escape yourdestiny. God is an embodiment of kaarya-kaarana —causeand effect. You haven’t understood the laws of cause and ef-fect.” So saying, Yoga Maya disappeared.Thence began Kamsa’s obsessive search for the Divinechild. Unable to limit his feelings of “I” and “Mine”, Kamsainitiated a massacre of all infants in his kingdom. Thousands ofpeople were treated with immeasurable cruelty. You may ask,why should innocent children be slaughtered? What sins havethese babies done? Why should God treat them so heartlessly?Such doubts may arise. Firstly, it was the basis for the destruc-tion of demonic persons. Secondly, it is only the body thatdies, not the Atma. You cannot escape death. Thirdly, the Lordcreated them and destroyed them, both as acts of His Will. It isnot easy to comprehend God’s Will.Sri Krishna’s childhoodGradually, Kamsa trained his eyes on Gokula. He sentmany demons there, all of whom were destroyed by the childKrishna. Not even one miscreant returned alive. At this time,Yasoda worried intensely about Krishna’s safety, although sheperceived Divine signs in Him. Then came Putana, an ogress.She took the form of a beautiful lady and approached Yasoda,“Sister, I heard that you gave birth to a son after many years. Iam surprised and delighted. May I see him?” There was noth-ing untoward in this request. In fact, people often came in thismanner. Yasoda took Putana inside unsuspectingly, since Pu-tana had assumed the form of one of her friends. Then Putanainsisted that she be allowed to nurse the baby. An argument48 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995ensued between the two of them, at which time Krishna begandrinking Putana’s milk. Not just her milk, but her life-force wasalso sucked out. Putana fell down dead. Everyone in Gokulawas astounded at the infant’s superhuman powers.Krishna showed many leelas in this manner. In everyAvatar’s life the first sixteen years are leelas, sports. From six-teen to thirty-five years of age are mahatmyas, miracles. Fromthirty-five to seventy-five years is the period of teaching.Every Avatar passes through these three stages. Till His six-teenth year, Krishna showed many leelas to the world. It isimpossible to limit these leelas. He displayed innumerable lee-las to the gopikas and gopalas. But they could not grasp them.Once, Balarama and Krishna were playing. Krishnastarting eating mud. Balarama complained to Yasoda, who camerunning. People in Gokula were in constant dread of Kamsa.Yasoda imagined that the mud may also be poisoned byKamsa! She asked, “So, you ate mud, did you?” By His repliesKrishna gave her glimpses into His reality. “Mother! Am I asmall boy to eat mud? Am I mad? No, no. It is not even hunger.I am not a boy.” What did Krishna mean? By denying what Hewasn’t, Krishna meant “I am God.” But bound in the feelingsof motherly affection related to the body, Yasoda could notrecognize Krishna’s Divinity. She said sternly, “Open yourmouth! I want to look inside.” Krishna complied. Yasoda sawthe entire universe inside His mouth! “Is it a dream, an illu-sion... what is happening? Am I Yasoda?” she wondered. Shewas totally confused. In this way Krishna gave glimpses of HisDivinity to His parents and friends.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199549Balarama was very mischievous. He used to ridiculeKrishna or rather, make a pretense of it, so that Krishna’smiracles may be known to all. He told Krishna, “Hey Krishna!You are not the son of mother Yasoda! Mother and father arefair in complexion but you are dark! How can you explainthat?” This was the truth—Krishna wasn’t their son! Krishnaran to Yasoda and asked most innocently, “Mother! They sayI’m not your son because I’m dark. Please tell me the truth.”He insisted and did not let go. Yasoda didn’t know the truthand said, “My dear son! You are really my son, my own son,”and hugged Him tightly. Then Krishna ate his food and wentaway. Krishna lived as an ordinary boy, behaved as if He knewnothing, displayed endless powers, and gave hints about HisDivinity constantly.The name Krishna is much sweeter than names likeHari, Narayana and Vishnu. Similarly, Radha is sweeter thanLakshmi, Durga, Saraswati, Sathyabhama, and Rukmini. Whatwords are easiest to say and sweetest as well? Krishna-Radha!Who are Krishna and Radha? Krishna is Purusha, God. Radhais Prakruthi, Nature. Everyone loves Nature and worships it.Nature is God’s base or dhara, which is the same as Radha.The Bhagavatham was written to reveal these divine concepts.A stalk of sugarcane is sweet, no doubt, but it also hashard joints in between. Can you demand that a sugarcane besweet through and through? Similarly, when speaking of Godwe experience unpleasantness also. You find bad inside good.The actions of God are the combination of good and bad. Hap-piness has no value without sorrow. For this reason, the adventof an Avatar is preceded by loss, misery and hardship in the50 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995world. These apply not just to God but to humans also. Everyperson has good and bad in his life. Even a millionaire has somewoes stealing his peace of mind.Mystery of AvatarsWhy, even renunciants have worries! Vashishta was adivine sage. He was the epitome of greatness, master of all di-vine powers. Even this divine sage sometimes failed to recog-nize Divinity. He knew that Rama was the incarnation of LordNarayana. Once upon a time he told Dasharatha, “KingDasharatha! I do not desire anything from you. I really have noneed to come to your kingdom and stay here as your RoyalPriest. But I know that Lord Narayana will incarnate in yourhouse. I want to see Him, serve Him. That is the only desirethat makes me stay here. I have not come for fame, respect,wealth or comfort.” Vashishta himself was competent to ac-quire all worldly prosperity by mere willing. Such a great sagelater taught Sri Rama the collection of teachings known as YogaVashishtam! Why did Vashishta fall into delusion? It was be-cause Rama behaved like a normal man, showing His Divinityonly occasionally.The outer form donned by Avatars misleads everyone.Another example. Scholars determine mahurtas, or auspiciousmoments, for important occasions such as marriages and inau-gurations of projects. Vashishta made a mahurta for Sri Rama’scoronation. After much study and meditation, Vashishta de-cided that 7:00 a.m. on a particular day would be most appro-priate to install Rama as King. This mahurta was meant forcoronation but resulted in exile! So what was its efficacy? Re-member, this was no ordinary mahurta set by some ordinarySummer Showers in Brindavan 199551Brahmin. Vashishta was a Brahmarishi.5 A mahurta set byhim cannot be invalid. Yet, did the coronation take place? No.Not just that, but Rama was exiled to the forest! How did thishappen? The reason is that NOTHING CAN STOP DIVINEWILL, not even the will of a Brahmarishi. Rama planned theseevents to show His Divinity to the world.Remember: Only God’s Will succeeds, no one else’s.God is sarva sanga parityagi—One who has renounced all at-tachment. But there is one bond that God cannot renounce: thebond of pure love between Him and His devotee. God changesHis Own Will such that the will of His devotee may be upheld.Markandeya was born by Lord Shiva’s blessing and was allot-ted only sixteen years of life. He told himself, “I have only six-teen years. These years should not be wasted. I will offer everymoment to God. Let me acquire a good reputation for myselfand my parents.” He contemplated on the Lord incessantly.Pleased by Markandeya’s purity and Love, the Lord mollifiedHis own condition by blessing him to stay sixteen years oldforever! God is Bhakta paraadheena —One who submits toHis devotees. Such is the mighty efficacy of devotion! Nonecan limit the power of devotees.But modern devotees are part-time devotees. One mo-ment they are devotees (bhakta) and the next moment, seekersof worldly pleasures (bhuktas). They are devious and cunning.They display piety and humility in Swami’s physical presencebut become different persons when they are away. This cannotbe called devotion. It is hypocrisy. You are cheating only your-self, no one else, much less, God! Who can cheat Me? Yat Bha-vam Thath Bhavati—as you act, so is the reflection and re-52 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995sound. I am not harmed by anyone. I do not hate anyone.Devotees might imagine that I dislike certain persons. That isyour hatred, not Mine.There is no blemish of any sort in Divinity. It is im-maculate, sacred and supremely pure. Your hearts must becomethat pure also. But that is not the case with devotees today.Devotees should concentrate on the Avatar’s Divinity. Do notbe misled by His vesture. You think “He is human” one mo-ment and “He is God” the next moment. This humanness of theAvatar is false. This is maya.What is maya? To see what is not real is maya. To for-get what really exists is maya. You forget what you see andunderstand and instead, harbor unknown doubts! Concentrateon the true essence of the Avatar, which is present in you also.That is what Sanjay Sahni said earlier: When you question,“Swami, are you God?” the answer is, “Yes, I am God, andyou are, too.” Everybody is a form of God. However, there is adifference. Here [in Swami] the Divinity appears without ob-struction but in you, it is hidden.Before the Mahabharatha war, Krishna questioned Ar-juna, “Why are you so dejected?” Arjuna replied, “Lord! Acolossal war is imminent. Scores of my friends and relativesmay perish.” Krishna said, “Foolish fellow! These people arenot here for the first time. They have undergone countlessbirths and deaths like us, since time immemorial. You are notthe killer and they cannot be killed. Your attachment is veilingthe Truth from you. You can neither kill them nor grant themlife.” Arjuna asked, “Lord, why is it that You know this truthSummer Showers in Brindavan 199553and I do not? I know only the present but not the distant pastYou speak of. What is the reason?”Then Krishna said, “Listen carefully to Me. How oldare you?”“84 years,” Arjuna said. Krishna continued, “You were alive ten years ago,weren’t you?”“Obviously, my Lord, because I am alive now!”“Fine. And when did you get married?”Arjuna gave the exact date, which was sixty years ear-lier.“When were you born?” was the next question.“84 years ago on such-and-such day,” replied Arjuna.“Fine. Now, tell me what you were doing three yearsago on the full moon day of Karthika?”6“I cannot recollect.”“But were you not alive then?”“Of course I was alive, Lord. But I cannot rememberthe details.”“Take note, Arjuna! You remember your marriage fromsixty years ago. But you have forgotten what hap-pened only three years ago. Why? Because the for-mer is important to you.”In the same way, people forget Divinity because it isnot important to them. You remember worldly details of yourlife because that is important to you. Your goal is the worldand hence, you build worldly bonds. You do not aim for Di-vinity, so you cannot recognize it, although it is your true na-ture. It is confusing to understand the Avatar’s Divinity which54 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995is clouded by His humanness. Is His humanness true or Hissuperhuman power? Both are false! Ignore the covering andfocus on the Divinity—that is true.Another example. King Janaka7 was resting after sup-per one day. His queen was by his side. Janaka felt sleepy. Thequeen dismissed the attendants. Janaka had a vivid dream inwhich neighboring kings had invaded his kingdom and drivenhim into the forest. He was wandering as a destitute in the for-est. He was overwhelmed with dejection and hunger. He beganshouting, “I am hungry! I am hungry!” Some tribals werenearby, eating rice. He ran to them. The tribals gave him a leafas a plate and shared their rice with him. All of a sudden an ea-gle swooped down upon the leaf and scattered the rice on theground. Janaka screamed in anguish.At this point Janaka really started screaming in hissleep. His queen shook him, “Lord, why are you shouting?”Janaka woke up and saw his queen, his soft bed and the opu-lent surroundings. But in his dream, he was exhausted, hungry,and forlorn. He saw this, he saw that. Which was true—this orthat? Janaka started questioning aloud, “Is this true or thattrue?” The queen was baffled, “My Lord, what strange wordsare these?” But Janaka repeated the question many times—“Isthis true or that true?”The queen panicked, fearing Janaka had gone insane.She sent for Sage Vashishta. Janaka was oblivious to Vash-ishta’s entry and continued to ask, “Is this true or that true?”Vashishta grasped the situation with his divine vision. He toldJanaka, “O King, neither this is true nor that. You alone areSummer Showers in Brindavan 199555true. You are present in the waking state and in the dream state.This is a daydream, and that was a night-dream. Neither ofthem is present in the other, but you are present in both. Youare the Truth.”Likewise, devotees perceive the Avatar’s Divinity andhumanness and then doubt, “Is Divinity true or is that human-ness true?” The divinity that you think you see is not true; nei-ther is the humanness. Underlying both is the sanctity of theAvatar. When your vision is pure, you perceive the Avatar’ssanctity. Divinity attracts sacredness.Body-consciousness causes attachmentAll the gopikas came to Yasoda and complained.“Mother! Your son Krishna comes stealthily into our houses,breaks our pots and steals butter and milk.” This was a dailyoccurrence! Yasoda caught Krishna and scolded, “You don’t eatwhat I serve. You go to other houses and steal. You are ruiningour reputation. Why don’t you eat the butter I give? Is the but-ter in our house not tasty?”What is the inner significance of this incident? Themother serves with motherly affection. But the gopikas servedthe same food with pure love, divine feelings! It was not thebutter that attracted Krishna but the purity of their hearts.Butter symbolizes the hearts of the gopikas, which were filledwith purity, one-pointedness, and selflessness. Yashoda’s but-ter was attachment, while the gopikas’ was prema. This is thedifference between love and attachment.56 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Attachment is born of body-consciousness. That whichis related to the heart is Love. Gopikas were full of love.Whether their mother-in-laws screamed or their husbandsshouted, they wouldn’t answer back or fight. They never hadany fear. The form of Krishna was imprinted in their hearts likewords on paper. It is not possible to separate letters from thepaper, is it? This is the principle of divine love, which we mustmake a sincere attempt to recognize. True love only gives andgives, never receives. Worldly love involves giving and receiv-ing. This is the difference between worldly and divine Love.God never desires or receives anything, only gives, like one-way traffic. But you give and receive, come and go. That iswhy Sankaracharya said,Punarapi Jananam, Punarapi Maranam,Punarapi Janani Jathare Shayanam.You are born again, you die again,And you lie in the mother’s womb, yet again.Bhaja Govindam, Bhaja GovindamGovindam Bhaja, Moodha Mate.Sampraapte Sannihite KaaleNahi Nahi Rakshati Dukrunkarane.Sing the glory of Govinda.Sing His glory, O fool!When your death approaches,The rules of grammar will not save you.Sing the glory of God without interruption. Don’t limityourself to “rules of grammar,” meaning identification with thebody. That is true worship, true faith. If the body is your goalSummer Showers in Brindavan 199557but you merely repeat “God, God” like a parrot, you willachieve only the body, not Divinity. There are many “confu-sions” of this sort in the Avatar principle. In no Avatar’s timewere there persons who had unbroken vision of His Reality.Even the Sapta Rishis were no exception! They recognizedRama, but fell into doubts from time to time. Why? After all,they had some traces of body-identification also.Identification with the body is the root cause of delu-sion. Forget the body and look inward. Why did our ancientsages shun cities and choose to live alone in forests? Becausethey followed Tyaja Durjana Samsargam—the first qualifica-tion for understanding Bhagavatham. They went away frompeople who were steeped in identification with the body. De-votion is the same whether living in your house or in the forest.But bad company is definitely avoidable in the forest. Withthis pure objective, our sages went away to forests.To reach Divinity, renounce bad company. Then culti-vate good company. Perform good acts day and night. Lastly,discriminate between the evanescent and the eternal. If studentskeep these four injunctions in mind, they can accomplish what-ever they want!The Bhagavatham is not just an account of the KrishnaAvatar. The deeds of sacred devotees such as Dhruva andPrahlada stand out as glorious examples in this scripture. If wepay attention to these devotees, we will come to know every-thing there is to know. These devotees had absolute faith inGod. In those ancient times, their unwavering faith earned themglorious experiences with God. We don’t have such faith today;58 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995and if we do, it is not steadfast. We should quell the waveringof the mind and remain steady under all circumstances.Vasudeva is a shining example of steadfastness. He sur-rendered his first child to Kamsa, just to uphold his word! Willany father do that today? Never! Harischandra worked in acremation ground and even sold his wife just to uphold truth.His son died and he lost his kingdom. Still he did not yield tountruth. Sathyam Naasti Paro Dharmah—there is no dharmahigher than truth. Never go back on your word. All worship,meditation and sacrifice are a waste if you renege on yourword. God does not go by your external actions but only byyour heart. God is Bhaava Priya. He delights in the internalfeeling. You are Baahya Priya. You crave for the external.Origin of BhagavathamStudents! Youth is a period characterized by unsteadi-ness. Youth can become prey to various kinds of confusion.But it is also the golden period of life. It is a sacred stage of life.You must achieve steadiness right now. Develop unwaveringfaith in God and remove the restlessness of your mind. Thenlife will have been well spent. There is nothing permanent inthis world. This world is called Jagat. Why? Ja (going) + Gat(coming) is the nature of the world—birth and rebirth, creationand destruction, joy and sorrow. But Divinity neither comesnor goes. This divine principle was given a written form byVyasa in this scripture, the Bhagavatham.Vyasa composed both the Mahabharatha and the Bha-gavatham. For his greatness he is called sloka daata—giver ofdivine verses. God is Loka Daata—Giver of the world itself. InSummer Showers in Brindavan 199559spite of writing so many slokas, Vyasa’s soka (sorrow) did notcome to an end. Why? When he wrote the Mahabharatha, hedescribed the fight between good and bad forces. As you think,so you become. In visualizing Duryodhana and Dussashana,Vyasa himself became tainted. Whatever “actor” you contem-plate on, his action enters your mind. That is why Narada ad-vised Vyasa, “Till now you wrote the Mahabharatha. Youcomposed this epic but sullied your heart in the process. Youthought about both good and bad characters. Now write onlygood.”The Vedas say, Thath Thwam Asi (You are That). Yatbhavam Thath bhavati. (You become whatever your think).When you constantly think of others’ faults, that bad entersyou. How? When you have a camera in your hand, whicheverdirection you turn and click, that is the picture you will cap-ture. Your body is like a camera. Your vision is the lens, yourheart is the film and your thoughts form the scene. Your intel-lect is the shutter. With your intellect, absorb only those im-pressions into your heart, which are spiritual. If you think bad,it imprints on your heart. So do not encourage bad thoughts.Narada continued, “As long you talked of theKauravas’ bad deeds, how they troubled and cheated the Pan-davas. Let go of the Kauravas’ sin. Let go of the Pandavas’ vir-tue as well. Brahmavid Brahmaiva Bhavati—think of the Lordand you will become Him. When you wrote the Mahab-haratha, you thought of Prakruthi (Nature, Creation) and notPurusha (God). So the restlessness of God’s Creation enteredyou. From tomorrow, describe only the Lord, His sports and60 Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995His qualities. You will achieve tranquility without a doubt.”Thus, the Bhagavatham came to be written.We must experience at least a fraction of Vyasa’s purefeelings. Purification of the mind must come first. A pure mindresults in God’s vision easily. The Bhagavatham is an accountof devotees’ experiences, their bliss and the close relations theyhad with the Lord—all of which we must absorb.What relation should we desire with God? What atti-tude results in what relation? What spiritual effort yields whatgoal? Inquire into these issues. You will repent later if suchquestions are not answered now. Make an effort to know eve-rything. Awareness is life. You must know what is good andwhat is bad. Then take the good to heart and renounce the bad.
                                                                                                                                                1. The Lord took the Vamana (dwarf) Avatar to destroy Bali, the king ofdemons. Bali was doing mass charity as part of a Vedic ritual. Vamanaapproached him and asked for land measuring 3 lengths of His Feet. Balilaughed at this request and told Vamana that He could have a whole conti-nent if He wanted. But when Vamana stuck to His strange demand, Balipromised to grant it. Meanwhile Bali’s guru recognized Vamana to be LordVishnu and advised Bali to save himself by retracting the promise. Balirefused to go back on his word. Vamana grew to gargantuan proportionsand with His Feet, enveloped all of Creation, thereby ridding Bali of hiskingdom as well as his ego. For his truthfulness, the Lord blessed the now-reformed Bali with future kingship of heaven as well as proximity to Him-self.2.

Nabhaka, Naabhaka, and AmbarishaPradoshe DeepakaschandrahPrabhaate Deepako RavihiTrailoke Deepako DharmahSuputrah Kula DeepakahThe Moon is the source of light at night.During the day, the Sun gives light.Dharma illumines the three world.A good son is the light of the family.There are two kinds of night: full moon and new moon.Darkness is not generally desired. But there are some people,like thieves and wicked people, who revel in it. Darkness aidesbad thoughts and facilitates sinful behavior. Hence it is calledRaakshasa Kaalam—demonic period of time. Night is charac-terized by thamo guna. Therefore, peaceful and virtuous peo-ple do not desire darkness.Pradoshe DeepakaschandrahThe full moon is bright and beautiful. Everyone awaitsthe full moon. Poets are inspired to compose poems looking atit and children play joyously in its cool light. The moon iscalled chandamama—Uncle Moon. He is an uncle to children,to parents, to grandparents...to everyone. He is the same toeveryone. Therefore, light has a lot of significance. It aids sa-cred thoughts.Prabhaate Deepako RavihiThe Sun and the Moon sustain the world. Without theSun there cannot be life. The Sun gives us light, seasons, rainand food. Many diseases are cured by the Sun’s benevolentrays. Even electricity can be generated from sunlight.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199563Trailoke Deepako DharmahThe third is dharma: Dharma means “that whichbinds.” Dharma binds us within limits, helping us tread theright path and discharge our duty. Dharma establishes normsof behavior between two persons, between a person and soci-ety and so on. It helps human values flourish. When dharmadeclines, human values suffer and this, in turn, spells the ruinof life. A country without dharma is a country of demons.Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah—Dharma protects those whoprotect it. Therefore, adherence to truth and dharma are mostimportant for students today. The Vedas say, Sathyam Vada,Dharmam Chara—speak the truth and follow righteousness.These are the great legacy from our ancient heritage. The truetreasures of Bharathiyas are only sathya and dharma.Suputrah Kula DeepakahNow, the fourth. A virtuous child brightens the wholefamily. Even a single virtuous person brings a good name to thefamily. One jasmine creeper lends an enchanting smell to theentire forest. If every house had even a single virtuous member,the world will glow with effulgence. Any number of childrenwithout virtue are useless. The Mahabharatha also teaches thistruth. Dhritharashtra had a hundred sons but they did not bene-fit him or his kingdom. Sage Suka had no children and yet, hewas ever blissful! Therefore, it is foolish to rejoice at the birthof a son. The father doesn’t feel happy merely at the birth of ason. Parents experience joy only when children demonstratepiety and earn unsullied reputations. Among today’s studentswe need suputras—good sons. Who is a “good son”? Is he onewith a good nose, good eyes, and a good body? No. Only one64Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995with pure qualities is a good son. No matter how handsome aboy may be, without virtue he is only ugly.The story of NaabhakaThe Bhagavatham contains the narrative of an emperorcalled Nabhaka. He had many sons, one of whom was Naab-haka.Naabhaka was a great scholar. He entered a gurukula1to learn different kinds of knowledge. He was an ideal student.He dedicated his time and his body to the acquisition of educa-tion. To this end he even forgot his parents! He considerededucation to be the jewel of life. He realized the tremendouspower of true knowledge and decided to spend his life acquiringit.Naabhaka came to spend most of his time in the Guru-kula. In due course his father, Nabhaka, grew old and resolvedto divide his wealth among his sons. He gave wealth to all hissons but forgot Naabhaka because Naabhaka was away in thepursuit of education. After completing his studies, Naabhakareturned home. He saw his brothers ruling the kingdom. Heasked them, “Brothers, where is my share of the inheritance?”They replied, “Father did not leave you a share. But we are yetto decide what to do with father himself. Hence, you can havefather as your share.”Naabhaka was highly educated. He recognized the re-spect due to a father and said, “Father is enough for me.” Asper the sacred culture of India—Maatru Devo Bhava, PitruDevo Bhava—mother and father are equal to God. Sri RamaSummer Showers in Brindavan 199565offered his entire life to uphold his father’s word. Similarly,Naabhaka said, “My father is my true wealth” and went to hisfather. He told Naabhaka, “Dear father, as my brothers havetold me, you are my real wealth.”His father replied, “Dear son, l have no property. But Iwill teach you a way to earn wealth. Sage Angirasa is perform-ing a Yagna. No one else in the world is competent to performthis Yagna. Two mantras are required for successful completionof this Yagna. Rithwiks2 have been conducting this Yagna for along time because they do not know how to complete it. Thesetwo mantras are your real wealth. I will teach them to you. Gothere and recite them.”Ever obedient, Naabhaka went to the Yagna. He ap-proached Sage Angirasa and said, “I can recite the mantras thatwill complete your Yagna.” He did so and the Yagna was com-pleted successfully. Angirasa acknowledged Naabhaka’s con-tribution and said, “Dear child, I’m leaving for Vaikunta3 now.Enjoy all the wealth collected for this ceremony.”After everyone departed, Naabhaka began gathering thewealth. A dark man approached and claimed authority over it.He said, “I’m Rudra.4 It is the Divine command that wealth leftover from all yagnas belongs to me.” Naabhaka said respect-fully, “You have your right and I have mine. Let us find a thirdperson to resolve our dispute.”They went to Nabhaka, who was a master of all scrip-tures. Nabhaka pondered the matter and judged not in favor ofhis son, but in Rudra’s favor. Naabhaka fell at Rudra’s feet and66Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995sought pardon for his mistaken claim. Rudra admired Naab-haka’s sense of justice, truthfulness and devotion to his father.Bestowing all the wealth on Naabhaka, Rudra said, “Son, thewhole world is illumined by your virtues. I’m pleased withyour ideal qualities. I have never met a student like you.” Rudrablessed him that he would rule the kingdom for a long time andalso gave him the most permanent wealth—Atma Vidya. Naab-haka was filled with Bliss. He went on to become the richestamong kings of the Ikshvaku5 dynasty.The story of AmbarishaIn due course, Naabhaka had a son called Ambarisha.The story of Ambarisha in the Bhagavatham is very sacred.Ambarisha was highly educated. He showered happiness on hissubjects, considering them his children. To him, his subjectswere parts of his body and the Lord was his heart. A king andhis subjects are related to each other as the head is to the body,he believed.Worldly experiences are dreams. Nothing is permanent.Anityam Asukham Lokam—the world is temporary and sor-rowful.Maata Naasti, Pita Naasti, Naasti Bandhu SahodarahArtham Naasti, Griham Naasti, Tasmaat Jaagrata JaagrataMother, father, brother, relatives, wealth, home—all are unreal. Therefore, beware, beware!All relations are to do with the body. They are based onattachment, not on love. Attachment is bondage. Knowing thisall too well, we still desire them and descend into bondage.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199567Ambarisha realized this very early in life. He decided that hewanted only the treasure of God’s proximity and not worldlyattachment.Sages Vashishta and Gautama once instructed KingAmbarisha to perform the Aswamedha Yaga.6 Many kings hadperformed the same yaga successfully but no one in any agehad done it like Ambarisha. He conducted it magnificently,giving away cows, land, gold and other articles in charity, arti-cles that people had never seen or heard of before. During theYagna, Ambarisha forgot his kingdom and even his body. Heconcentrated only on Lord Narayana. At the end of the Yagna,Lord Narayana appeared and presented His personal weapon,Sudarsana Chakra, to Ambarisha.What is meant by Sudarsana? In a worldly sense, itmeans a disc endowed with power. Spiritually, Sudarsanameans “good sight”—the ability to see everything in its truelight. Armed with this blessing of Sudarsana, Ambarisha wasable to enjoy the world and surmount all difficulties in his life.He had no worries, sorrow or desires. He concentrated whole-heartedly on the Lord.Sometime later, instructed by Sage Vashishta, Am-barisha performed the Dvaadasi Vrata, twelve-month vow.After observing certain disciplines for twelve months, Am-barisha was to fast on the day prior to the completion of theone year period. The fast was to be broken at a particular timethe next day, just before the end of the year. And after partak-ing food himself, he was to feed his subjects as well. Thesewere the stipulations of the vow.68Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Ambarisha was getting ready to break his fast on thelast day. Sage Durvasa arrived unexpectedly. Ambarisha hon-ored him. Durvasa said, “O King, no one has performed such avow in the world. You will achieve great fame. Your kingdomwill always experience peace and abundance.” Ambarishapleaded, “Swami, you must accept my hospitality today.”Durvasa said, “With pleasure. But give me some time. I will goto the river, bathe and complete my daily prayers.” So saying,Durvasa left for the river with his entourage.Ambarisha started getting worried when Durvasa didnot return even after a long time. Why? On the one hand, theetiquette of a host demanded that he could not eat before of-fering food to his guest. On the other hand, rules of theDvadasi Vrata dictated that Ambarisha had to eat before theauspicious moment of the completion of one year, which hadarrived. Ambarisha was as worried now, as he was peacefulduring the vow. Vashishta suggested that he touch a few dropsof Tulasi7 water to his lips to break his fast, assuring him thatno fault would accrue to him by this act. Ambarisha obeyedVashishta.Durvasa returned after the auspicious moment. He di-vined Ambarisha’s action. He said, “Ambarisha, you are blindwith pride!” Ambarisha asked, “Honorable Sage, what is myfault?” Durvasa said, “How dare you act innocent! You inviteme as a guest and then eat before you serve me! Is this not aviolation of the principles of hospitality? I am a Maharshi,8not an ordinary guest! To insult me is not expected of you!”Ambarisha claimed innocence, humbly but fearlessly. But Dur-vasa was adamant. He plucked one hair from his head and em-Summer Showers in Brindavan 199569powered it with a mantra. A terrible demoness appeared andlifted her sword to kill Ambarisha. In a flash, the SudarsanaChakra appeared and put an end to the demoness. The Lord’sweapon then turned on Sage Durvasa.Durvasa fled. Sudarsana Chakra followed him throughforests, rivers, deserts, plains, cities... everywhere. Durvasa ranand ran. Finally, he sought refuge in Brahma Loka, LordBrahma’s abode. Brahma told him, “I’m helpless. I cannotchallenge Lord Narayana’s power. I am the Lord’s servant. Youwill gain nothing from me.”Durvasa then fled to Kailasa, Lord Shiva’s home. LordSankara spoke similar words, “I have no right to oppose Nara-yana’s Will. I cannot help you.” Durvasa then ran to Lord Na-rayana Himself. The Lord said, “O Sage! Do you not see Myhelplessness? I may be all-powerful, but I cannot break onebond: The bond with devotees who have renounced everythingfor Me. I will always submit to My devotees. Ambarisha isone such devotee. He has renounced everything and he seeksMe alone. I cannot deny such surrender. The power of love(prema shakthi) of My devotees is greater than My own willpower (iccha shakthi)! I cannot help you in the least. But I willsuggest a solution. Seek the pardon of Ambarisha.”As advised by Lord Vishnu, Durvasa retraced his stepsand fell at Ambarisha’s feet. Durvasa’s penance and powerswere unsurpassed. Imagine, such a great sage falling at a king’sfeet! Ambarisha was surprised and embarrassed. He said, “Ogreat sage! You are rich in penance and wisdom. Please do notfall at the feet of an ordinary man like me.” Durvasa replied,70Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995“In my pride I spoke harsh words to you. I made you sufferwithout recognizing your sincere devotion. Pardon me.” Am-barisha then prayed on Durvasa’s behalf, “O Lord Vishnu, Youare the embodiment of Love and Compassion. You are all-knowing and omnipotent. Please forgive the sage’s faults.”Only then the Sudarsana Chakra stopped pursuing the sage.The Lord is a servantWhat is the inner significance of this story? The Lord isa servant of His devotees. He is the final authority everywhere,except in the presence of His devotee! The Lord’s powers arebenign to His devotees and devastating to wicked people. Ha-numan’s life signified the same idea. Hanuman was humble infront of Rama but bold and terrible to Ravana. Virtue, faultlessbehavior, renunciation—all these are merely facets of devotion.Ambarisha was an emperor not just of his kingdom, butin the kingdom of devotion as well. Even Brahma, Vishnu, andShiva had to bow to his devotion! The efficacy of devotion isAvaang Maanasa Gocharam—beyond thought and word. Inthis Kali age, people do not understand devotion. They thinkdevotion is limited to worship, bhajans, and vows. God’sForm should be imprinted in your heart like words on paper!There should be no separation, no distinction between you andGod. Such intense faith is rare today. Ambarisha’s eyes onlysaw Narayana, his ears heard only the Lord’s Name, his feetapproached only the Lord and his hands were ever engaged inworship. Divine brilliance flowed through all his senses.Nabhaka, Naabhaka, and Ambarisha—grandfather, fa-ther and son—all three were highly educated. What educationSummer Showers in Brindavan 199571did they have? Not worldly education, but Atma Vidya!9Krishna said: Aadhyatmika Vidya Vidyaanaam—true knowl-edge is knowledge of the Self. The different kinds of worldlyknowledge are small tricklesm which merge into the ocean ofAtma Vidya. Nadeenaam Saagaro Gatih—all rivers are destinedfor the ocean. It is only because he pursued spiritual knowledgehand-in-hand with worldly knowledge that Ambarisha becameworthy of the Lord’s protection. He was able to subdue thecurse of a sage. A curse given by a sage is normally irrevocable.But Ambarisha was able to humble even a sage of Durvasa’sstature!Nothing in the world comes close to the power of devo-tion. But fools are blind to it. Truly, one who recognizes thepotency of devotion cannot stay aloof from the path even for amoment. Even nectar may have traces of bitterness but theprinciple of devotion is sweetness, sweetness, sweetness.Premaamritam—the nectar of devotion—is the limit of sweet-ness. Such premaamritam is present only between God anddevotees. All other relations are based on attachment. Love andattachment are poles apart. People tell Swami, “I love you, Ilove you, I love you.” What is love? They don’t know.ServiceChatterji just spoke about “help.” Students have noidea even what “help” means. They just repeat phrases like“Help Ever, Hurt Never.” Help means to render assistance. Butwhat kind of help, where, to whom and how? We must under-stand this well. That is why the Bhagavatham says: Charitymust be based on eligibility. Do not help anyone, anytime,72Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995anywhere. Before acting you must assess, “To whom am I ren-dering help and how? What would be the result of my action?”You can’t give a knife to a wicked man, or a gold cup to a child.There must be deservedness in help. Otherwise, help can turninto harm. When should you help? When you watch someonesuffering, feel it in your heart. Feel their pain and serve whenyour heart melts. Meaning, offer help to that cause which meltsyour heart. When many people can be benefited, you maydefinitely help. Help is not just to individuals. It should be re-lated to society and even to the world.This morning, Ashok Singhal talked about the impor-tance of service. What is service? People say it means doing“good work.” Do not think of seva as “good work”. Even theattitude “I am doing good to others” is not positive. The rightattitude is to see it as “God’s work”! True seva is to considerall your actions as God’s work.Na Tapaamsi Na Teerthaanaam.Na Saastra Na Japaanahi.Samsaara Saagaroddhaare.Sajjanam Sevanam Vina.Not by penance or pilgrimage,Nor by study of scriptures or repetition of God’sname,But the ocean of birth and death can be crossed only byServing the pious and the needy.Help pious and needy people alone. If a man is beatinganother man, will you help him in that act? Always discrimi-nate before jumping to help. Someone asks you for money.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199573You must ask him why he wants money. If he says he is hun-gry, give him food, not money. His real need is food. If he in-sists on money, such a person should not be helped. If he iscold, give warm clothes. If he is ill, give medicine. But don’tgive money. Why? He will spend it on liquor, go home anddrown himself and his family in misery. By giving money youhave not helped him, but hurt him! So, always inquire whomyou should help, when, where and how. This is true seva.People think, “I am the giver, he is the recipient.” Thisis not seva. Once upon a time a man resolved to perform seva.He told himself, “I am a servant. That is why I serve.” The Di-vinity present in servitude is not present in authority. Heprayed:Daasaanudaasudanu Kaavalenu Ra,Daasulaku Sevane Cheyavale Ra.O Lord! Let me be the servant of Your servant. Let me be busy serving Your servants.What is the meaning? The goal of service is to subdueegoism. The egoist can never serve and the real servant is ego-less. Proceed into service with such an outlook. There is noth-ing greater than service. We should develop humility. Author-ity and power do not stay forever. Wealth can vanish any mo-ment. But virtues are permanent.When Hanuman entered Lanka, all the demons were in-trigued by his appearance. They had never seen a monkey be-fore. Why? Recall that Lanka was surrounded by the sea on allsides, and what monkey can cross the ocean? While they gaped74Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995at Hanuman with surprise, he laughed and played impishpranks. Then a demon questioned, “Hey, who are you?” Theanswer came: “Daasoham Kosa-lendrasya”—“You ask who Iam? I am the servant of Rama.” Hanuman did not say, “I amthe virtuous, strong and devoted son of the Wind God” and soon. It is because of his humility that Hanuman always suc-ceeded in the tasks allotted to him by Rama. To fulfill God’scommands, first we must render our ego powerless. We shouldexpress humility. Not merely express it, but practice it.People think, “I am so educated, so intelligent, so influ-ential.” How long do authority and power last? With retire-ment, your influence vanishes like snow on a summer day! Theworld has seen kings and rulers, each greater than the other.Many emperors ruled over India. Where are they today?Wealth and authority are transient, but virtues are lasting. Ithas been eons since Ambarisha died. But the glories of his char-acter are sung the world over till this day. Therefore, we be-come worthy of immortal fame when we shine in virtue.Worldly joys are “passing clouds”. Ambarisha recognized thistruth. Nothing in this world grants happiness or peace. Happi-ness and peace are unique to God’s proximity alone. The Kingof Tanjavur wanted to present wealth to Thyagaraja. Thyaga-raja sang:Nidhi chaala sukhamaa, Isvara sannidhi chaala suk-hama? Nijamuga Telupumu Manasa!O mind, what grants happiness—wealth (nidhi) orproximity to God (Isvara sannidhi)?Summer Showers in Brindavan 199575As long as worldly joys are around, you may experi-ence them. It is not possible to renounce them entirely. But forGod we should be ready to give up everything! “Less luggage,more comfort.” Reduce responsibilities and desires gradually.Desires are the greatest thieves and cheats. Desires are the rootcause of restlessness. Sacrifice is the basis for peace. Everyman must encourage pure feelings and sacrifice in his heart if hedesires Divinity. Even if you have no devotion, that is okay.Your pure feelings are your devotion.There are many meanings given to the word “help”. Weshould not use this word carelessly. True help should includethe society and permeate your thoughts, words, sight, hearingand hands. Help rendered with unity of thought, word and deed(trikarana suddhi) is true service. Help means love and com-passion guiding your hands.There was an old woman full of sacrifice and kindness.During the rainy season, the cool breeze made nights very cold.In the evenings she would go along the streets with a bundle ofblankets. Many homeless people slept on the footpath. Shewould cover each of them with a blanket. Gradually the towns-folk came to know of this daily ritual. “What humility and sac-rifice she has! Is there anyone in the world doing more servicethan her?” they thought. When everybody praised her in thismanner, she used to veil her head and walk away.One boy asked her, “Grandma! Why don’t you holdyour head high for this wonderful seva?” She said, “Son, I’mnot helping anyone.” The boy said, “But aren’t you donatingblankets to the shivering street people every day?” She said,76Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995“Son, God has given us two hands. Compared to what Hedoes, all our work is trivial. And I’m using only one hand todistribute the blankets. I feel ashamed for not using the otherhand. I can hold my head high only when God blesses me withopportunities to serve with both my hands.”There are many fools in the world who do not sacrificedespite being rich. They go to the market with loose change intheir pockets, not currency notes. They give a few coins toeach beggar they encounter. Another example. I went to Bom-bay a few days ago. From Bombay, we had to drive to a nearbytown. On the way we stopped at a red light. Many beggarssurrounded the car. I noticed one woman carrying a baby andfelt very pained. But I do not even have a pocket, what to talkof money! I told Indulal Shah, “You give her something.” Hegave one rupee from his pocket. Do you know what that ladydid? She tossed it back into the car saying, “You cannot getanything with one rupee today, Sir. You can keep it!”Even five rupees are not much to beggars today. In sucha situation, will a few coins do any good? Some people are sostingy that even the coins they donate are counterfeit! No, no.Where did you get all your money? We see big industrialists,rich beyond the common man’s imagination. How did they getrich? The money was earned with the assistance of the middleclass, the laborers, the officers. When you know that everyoneis responsible for your prosperity, you must sacrifice for theirsake. In the Kali Yuga, riches only increase pride instead ofevoking sacrifice in people. Na Karmana Na Prajaya DhanenaTyaagenaike Amritatvamaanashu—not by rituals, children, orSummer Showers in Brindavan 199577wealth, but only by sacrifice is immortality attained. Keepwhat you need and share the rest.Hastasya Bhooshanam Daanam.Sathyam Kanttasya Bhooshanam.Charity is the ornament for the hand.Truth is the ornament for the throat.What ornaments do you desire? Gold? Diamonds? No,no. What other decorations do we need besides charity, truthand the Lord’s Name? This is true sacrifice.Desire God aloneTherefore, all of you should promote unity based onthe Atma, contemplate on Divinity and do actions beneficial tothe common good. How can you call yourself a human withoutfollowing human values? Today’s dire need are human values,human values.How can we make human values grow? A seed growsinto a plant when embedded in fertile soil. Will it germinate in atin? No. Similarly, the seed of human values can grow only inthe soil of spirituality. Without this fertile and enduring soil ofspirituality, humanness cannot be strengthened. The heart filledwith Love for God is like nutritious soil. Sow your seed in sucha heart.Look at Ambarisha. Despite his vast knowledge, wealthand powers, he renounced worldly joys: “I want only God,nothing else. He alone is my goal.” Keep God as your goal. To-day’s students change their ambitions a hundred times a day!78Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995No, no. Till your last breath your goal should not change. Evenif you encounter a hundred troubles, face and overcome them.Do not let them deter you. That is the quality of a true human.Look how Ambarisha suffered. Durvasa’s curse caused himmuch hardship. But his one-pointed mind and steady visionbore him through everything.A one-pointed mind and steady vision—these two arethe touchstones of devotion that every devotee must acquire.Our vision must focus only on the Lord. Our mind must medi-tate only on God. The sole motivation for all our actions mustbe to earn God’s Love (Bhagavat preetyartham).Seek knowledge in student yearsStudents! Fill your hearts with such pure feelings. Yes,you are filling yourselves. But with what? With absurd novels,TV, radio and videos. It is not even enough to fill your hearts.Translate into action! That is the mark of a true student. Seek-ers of knowledge (vidyarthis) should not turn into seekers ofworldly joy (vishayarthis).Desire only knowledge as long as you are a student. Af-ter completing education, you may desire money. Ambarishadid not care for anything as long as he pursued knowledge. Heentered the kingdom only after completing his education. Thatis how he was able to serve his subjects. He initiated projectsof public welfare, won his people’s love and even attained theVision of God.All work is God workSummer Showers in Brindavan 199579Ambarisha achieved Divinity, the Grace of God. Stu-dents! You may not win or be eligible for anything, but earnDivine Grace. That is enough. Earn God’s Grace first and youcan achieve whatever you wish. Thyagaraja sang, “Rama, all Ineed is your grace (anugraha). Then the nine celestial powers(nava grahas) will submit to me.” You may study great sub-jects, get coveted jobs and earn wealth, but nothing is of valueunless you earn God’s Grace.A student in Varanasi had no job. He approached themunicipality. They told him, “Son! Jobs are scarce today. Butthere is nobody to light the oil lamps on the streets. You can dothat if you wish.” The poor boy said, “I am ready for any job,Sir.” So he would clean each lamp at dusk, fill it with oil andlight it. He did everything as an act of service. As he cleanedeach glass frame he thought, “Rama, this is my service to You.”He visualized that He was cleaning Rama’s Feet with each rub.As a result, his lamps were immaculate and glowed brighterthan all others. The municipal officers recognized this andsummoned him, “Son! Your lights are burning as brightly asyour pure, sacred heart.” The boy did not care for recognition.He did it out of his enthusiasm, for his own satisfaction.Today’s service is pomp. They take a broom in theirhands and call the photographer, “Hey, take a photo of medoing service!” This is for others, not for yourself, not for theAtma. That which gives you unalloyed happiness and increasesyour enthusiasm is true service. Service makes you forgetyourself.80Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Students! The Bhagavatham has many examples ofdevotees with full hearts. Recognize their characters, hold themas ideals in your mind and emulate them. This is the Kali Yuga.A more suitable name is Kalaha Yuga, Era of quarrels! Thereare fights even for small matters. In the midst of conflict, de-velop hearts of purity and serve your country. Recognize thatyou are serving only yourself, not anyone else. The same Godis in everyone. Your ego will recede as your attitude of servicestrengthens. When you engage in service with such divine feel-ings, our country will shine brightly with purity and prosper-ity.

One can develop relationships and even invite deathwith one’s speech. Words are crucial for profit and loss, reputeand disrepute, joy and sorrow. When words are good, the resultis good. Bad words produce bad results. Every man should dis-criminate between good and bad words, control his speech anduse only appropriate words.Dharma and justice are the foundations of the universe.Dharma Eva Yato Moolam, Dharma Eva Mahaatgunam—there is no foundation or virtue greater than dharma. The onewho defined, practiced, and propagated dharma for the good ofhumanity was Emperor Manu. He had two sons. The first wasUttaanapaada and the second, Priyavrata. Uttaanapaada hadtwo wives—Suniti and Suruchi. Suniti’s son was Dhruva andUttama was Suruchi’s son.These stories are very important for today’s students.When students listen to inspiring accounts of pure souls, theirtender hearts can be transformed. There are many changes inthe world today. Human life itself is a series of changes—frominfancy to adolescence, then to middle-age and senility. An egg82Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995becomes a bird. A seed grows into a tree. These are all effectsof change. Change is necessary not just in Nature but in hu-mans also, especially, in youth. What kind of change? Idealtransformation. To pride yourself on changing from a boy intoan educated man is not ideal change. Ego is not a sign of truetransformation. Education must result in the blossoming ofhumility and obedience. Humility is the jewel of students. Un-fortunately, it cannot be found nowadays. In the days of theBhagavatham, students developed human values, contemplatedon Divinity and earned the Vision of God.The story of Prince DhruvaDhruva was five years old and Uttama, four-and-a-half.Once both were playing in the garden. Their father, Uttaana-paada, was watching them indulgently and enjoying himself.After some time Uttama became tired. He ran and sat in his fa-ther’s lap. Uttaanapaada was extremely fond of Suruchi, themother of Uttama. Suniti’s son, Dhruva, also ran forward to dothe same.Suddenly Suruchi ran forward and flung Dhruva awayfrom his father. As if that wasn’t enough, she hurt his tenderheart with harsh words: “Dhruva! You may be the King’s son,but not mine. Only a son born of me has the right to sit on theKing’s lap. If you want to sit on your father’s lap, the onlyway is for you to take another birth as my son! This is yourfate for being Suniti’s son. In this manner, Suruchi unleashedarrow-like words at Dhruva.Dhruva walked back to his mother’s palace. He enteredand sat down silently in a corner. Tears were coursing down hisSummer Showers in Brindavan 199583cheeks. Some maids noticed his condition and informed Suniti.Even when asked by his mother, Dhruva sat quietly with atear-stained face. Suniti came to know of the incident from hermaids. She lamented her plight, “Dhruva, you had the misfor-tune of being born to me. I am treated like a maid by everyonein the palace because the King favors the other queen. So howcan my son get any respect?” She told Dhruva, “My son, prayto God and be born to Suruchi.”Immediately Dhruva replied, “I have no more interest inlife after this insult.” He blamed his stepmother for her selfish-ness. Suniti went close to him and stopped him, “My son, weshould not criticize or blame others. Why? Because the resultof that blame accrues to us also. Your stepmother’s words, de-spite being harsh, will result only in your good. Whatever any-one may say is for your good. Do not blame your stepmother.She has shown you the path of your destiny.” Will any motheradvise likewise today? But Suniti was different. Her name wasSuniti, meaning “embodiment of virtue (niti)”. She passed onthose morals to her son also.Dhruva said, “So what do you want me to do, mother?”Suniti replied, “Son! No one can really help another. It is Godalone who is the sole refuge of everyone. He alone can fulfill allyour wishes. Go to the forest and seek Lord Narayana toachieve your desires.” Are there such mothers today, who sendtheir five-year-old sons to the forest for penance? She placedher hand on Dhruva’s head as blessing and said, “Whether youare in the forest, city, village, mountains, or sea, God is theonly refuge of the forlorn. Instead of suffering in the palace, itis much better to delight in thoughts of God in the forest.84Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Wherever you may be, I am not in a position to help you. Godwill take care of you. Don’t think of the forest as a forest butas God’s abode. Go and seek Him, my son.”Dhruva accepted his mother’s words as command,prostrated at her feet and left immediately. A mere five-year-old boy! He did not know what a forest was, the way leadingthere, how to pray, what pleases God...nothing! Yet, he didn’tpause to worry about these issues. “I must follow mymother’s command. I must undertake penance. I must achievethe Lord’s Vision.” There was no thought in his mind besideshis goal.By the power of Suniti’s blessing, the Divine sage Na-rada met Dhruva midway. Narada divined Dhruva’s intentions.He asked the lad, “Where are you going, young Dhruva? Areyou going to play?” Dhruva said, “Yes, O Divine Sage, I amgoing to play with God.” Narada asked, “Where is God?”Dhruva answered, “My mother told me to go to the forest andseek Him.”Narada exclaimed, “O foolhardy child! Don’t you knowthat most renunciates and knowers of scriptures cannot attainthe Lord even after centuries of penance? You are a child. Youhave no worldly experience. You don’t know about God. Howcan an innocent, ignorant child like you achieve God? It is im-possible!” Dhruva replied, “Narada, age is not important to theLord. My mother’s blessing and my determination will take meto the goal.”Summer Showers in Brindavan 199585Narada tried to dissuade Dhruva by talking of discom-fort, fear and failure. “There are many animals in the forest.Dangerous snakes will pursue you everywhere. Ghosts and evilspirits abound as well. You are accustomed to royal comforts,having no experience in the ways of the world. No, what youhave determined is too much.” But Dhruva was firm. “I willnever return to the palace. My resolve is a divine one, not awicked one. God dwells in a pure heart. A decision thatemerges from my heart is, therefore, a Divine decision! I willnever give it up.”Today’s students have a glorious lesson to be learntfrom Dhruva. STRONG DETERMINATION—this is neces-sary for every achievement in life.Dhruva did not give heed to Narada’s words. “It is mymother’s command. I should follow it even at the cost of mylife and prove the value of a mother’s word. I must, and will,succeed. As soldiers are the life of a fort, as a signature is thelife of a promissory note, similarly Truth is life to our facultyof speech. I will never give up Truth. Sathyam Naasti ParoDharmah—there is no dharma higher than Truth. I am thegrandson of Manu, who was a great proponent of dharma. Imust be the embodiment of sathya and dharma.” These werethe lofty thoughts chasing each other in Dhruva’s mind.Narada finally admitted defeat. He admired Dhruva’sresolve and felt pity for him. He said, “Son! Your determina-tion and purity have deeply affected me. I will come with youfor a while.” They went to the banks of River Yamuna. There,Narada instructed Dhruva, “Dear child, if one chants the Name86Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995of the Lord with a purified mind, the Lord appears soon.”They had a bath in Yamuna and Narada whispered into the earof Dhruva, the great dvaadasi (twelve-syllable) mantra: OmNamo Bhagavate Vaasu-devaaya.After Narada left, Dhruva found a shady part in theforest, fixed his seat and began chanting the mantra. He chantedOm Namo Bhagavate Vaasudevaaya without interruption. Heforgot his body. However, because of his tender age, he felthungry and thirsty at times. During the first month, he atefruits fallen on the ground. In the second month, he ate onlytubers and leaves. In the third month, he subsisted on water. Inthe fourth month, he survived on air. His body was reduced toa skeleton. That is natural for the body. The body is born offood. It is called annamaya kosa—sheath of food.Within this physical sheath are praanamaya kosa(sheath of life), manomaya kosa (sheath of mind), vi-jnaanamaya kosa (sheath of knowledge) and finally, anan-damaya kosa (sheath of bliss). Dhruva neglected only the an-namaya kosa. He merged the name of the Lord with hispranamaya kosa. With inhalation and exhalation, he repeatedOm Namo Bhagavate Vaasudevaaya.Next, manomaya kosa. Dhruva clearly pictured in hismind the form of the Lord as described by Narada, which wasimprinted in his heart. What is the inner meaning? He recitedthe Lord’s Name while picturing His Form. And he picturedthe Lord’s Form while reciting His Name. Name andForm—this became Dhruva’s penance.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199587Name + Form = penance (tapas)The whole forest became hot due to Dhruva’s one-pointedness. Sages dwelling there could not bear it. They wereastonished that a five-year-old boy could sustain such iron con-trol over the mind. They tried to obstruct his concentration inmanifold ways. They created snakes, which circled his body.They sent wild animals and evil spirits to trouble Dhruva. Butnothing could disturb him, much less harm him. Dhruvathought, “My mother said that God is the refuge of the help-less. So the Lord will take care. I need not worry!” What deepfaith he had! When nothing could even distract Dhruva, theGods in heaven went to Narayana to intervene on Dhruva’sbehalf.Dhruva’s eyes were closed. He didn’t even want tolook at the world. “I do not desire anything belonging to thisworld,” he had decided at the outset. “This body is composedof the five elements. It is bound to collapse one day. But theIndweller has neither birth nor death. That Indweller is God. Ihave assumed this body for the sole purpose of seeing that In-dweller.” Gradually, he became so weak that his voice was nolonger audible. He repeated Om Namo Bhagavate Vaasu-devaaya in his mind. Finally, the Lord responded. Lord Nara-yana appeared in front of Dhruva.As the Lord came closer and closer, His effulgence in-termingled with Dhruva’s aura and Dhruva shone brighter andbrighter. Suddenly, finding his heart empty of the Lord’s Form,Dhruva opened his eyes. He saw the Lord standing in front ofhim. Smiling, Dhruva said, “O Lord, as long You were in my88Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995heart. Now You are outside me. Are You trying to leave me? Iwon’t allow it.”Dhruva had recognized that what we see outside is a re-flection of our own hearts. If you feel that someone is bad, thatbad is not in him, but only a reflection of your heart. Your ownthoughts, both good and bad, appear to you outside as reflec-tion, reaction, resound.Even Lord Narayana was taken aback at Dhruva’s idealqualities! The Lord mused, “How surprising that these eternalfeelings have entered this young boy! He is enjoying the bene-fits of many past lives spent in the divine Quest.” Thinkingthus, the Lord laughed within Himself. Dhruva had lost hisvoice but still, he started extolling the Lord. He described all theten Avatars of the Lord and His exploits. He gazed upon theLord continuously, without blinking. He held the Lord’s LotusFeet tightly. The Lord asked him, “Child, what do you want?”Dhruva could not produce any sound. He appealed to the Lordmentally. The Lord touched his cheeks with His Conch andfresh energy coursed through his body, restoring his speech.Then the Lord stood back, clenching His Hands together.Dhruva approached the Lord, closer and closer. TheLord asked him again, “Dhruva, tell Me what you desire.”Dhruva was so enraptured that the Lord had to repeat thequestion many times. Finally Dhruva said, “My Lord! Why doYou insist on drowning me in maya? You knew where I was,what I was doing and who I was praying to. Otherwise Youcould not have come here. Knowing all this, don’t You knowwhat I desire? Of course, You do!”Summer Showers in Brindavan 199589Dhruva was talking high philosophy! But God had readtwo books more on spirituality than Dhruva! Lord Narayanareplied, “Child! The thought that prompted your penance wasthe desire to sit in your father’s lap. You put this thought intoaction by performing this penance. But it remains to be seenwhat your word will be.”Students should recognize clearly what God was look-ing for. Manasekam Vachasyekam Karmanyekam Mahaatmanam—unity in thought, word, and deed is the mark of agreat soul. “You resolved upon a goal. You acted as per yourresolve. Now, I want to hear from your lips: What do youseek?” the Lord clarified.Dhruva replied, “Dear Lord, in ignorance I desired myfather’s affection. Unable to bear an ordinary insult, I sought tosit in my father’s lap and enjoy my rightful privileges as hisson. I acted upon that resolve. Now that I’ve seen You,touched You and talked to You, I want only You. I craved adrop of water and found Divine Nectar itself. I desired a pieceof glass and found a diamond.”The Lord smiled. “Dhruva, by thought and deed youdesired your father’s proximity. But by word, you desire onlyMe. Your thought, word, and deed are not in harmony. How-ever, note that the majority lies toward your initial desire.Hence, it is My command that you return to your father’skingdom and make your mother happy.”90Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Do you see, how subtle, mysterious, and impeccableare the Lord’s ways? The Lord did appear. He showered graceon the boy in manifold ways. But Dhruva’s thought, word, anddeed were not in harmony. For such a small fault, poor Dhruvalost to the Lord! Finally Dhruva said, “I offer everything toYou,” and left the decision to Narayana. The Lord said, “Son,obey My command. Till now, you followed your mother’scommand. Now, I am your father, mother and everything.There is no lasting happiness in the world.Janma Dukham, Jaraa Dukham, Jaaya Dukham PunahPunah Antya Kaale Mahaa Dukham, TasmaatJaagrata Jaagrata!Birth, old age and death are full of sorrow.The final moments are most pathetic.So beware, beware!I am sending you back so that you fulfill your initialresolution. You must return without hesitation,” said the Lord.Having said this, the Lord waited for Dhruva’s response.Dhruva said, “It is Your command and I will obey it.No matter what I may experience by leaving You and returning,no matter how disappointing, I will follow Your command.”Only after he made this promise, the Lord came forward andtook Dhruva in His embrace. Holding him close, the Lordspoke endearingly to the young lad. “Dhruva! For God to beearned by such a young boy as you—this has never happenedin the world.”Summer Showers in Brindavan 199591There is an acute need for such boys and girls in theworld today—truthful, obedient to parents and devoted toGod. There is no meaning in devising new social orders andprinciples. Is it enough to merely change societies in this man-ner? No, thoughts must change! Divine, novel, elevating feel-ings must be encouraged by students.The Lord continued, “Dhruva! You have to teach muchto the world about the glory of the Divine Name. Now I willenter you.” A light emerged from the Lord and entered Dhruva.The boy who was so frail for the past few months was filledwith energy and brightness. He jumped up and touched theLord’s Feet. The Lord disappeared.The Lord’s ethereal voice continued speaking toDhruva. “Dearest child! You must rule the world as an idealemperor for many years yet. Your father is repentant. He looksforward to your return, moment to moment. He has given upfood and sleep and wants only you. Go back, go back, go back.After you complete the task of ruling the kingdom, I have setaside an exalted position for you. The Polaris Star situated inthe midst of the Sapta Rishis, the Sun and the Moon shallhenceforth be called Dhruva Star. All celestial bodies circle theDhruva Star. Even Polaris itself may change but you will beeternal. You are an embodiment of immortality. Your life willbe an expression of Bliss.” The Lord also promised thatDhruva would reach Him at the end of his life span.Just look at how much Grace overflowed to Dhruvawhen he agreed to follow the Lord’s command! Dhruva ob-tained immortal fame, the Lord’s constant presence within92Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995himself and the Lord’s love. Much, much more than what heoriginally desired. That is why it is not necessary to ask Godfor your desires. Just follow the Lord’s commands and HisGrace will overflow, unasked.The sanctity of the BhagavathamIn this manner, the Bhagavatham is full of devotion.But there is no one today with even a thousandth part ofDhruva’s devotion and virtue. The sanctity of Bhagavatham isunsurpassed because it contains the lives of such exalted souls.But people neglect this scripture and even cast wrong accusa-tions on it. Bhagavatham is nothing but God’s Love, from startto finish. But all cannot understand Divine Love. Some schol-ars’ interpretations of Krishna’s leelas are atrocious!At what age did Krishna play with the gopikas?Krishna was a five-year old boy! At that age is it possible tointeract with gopikas as commonly portrayed? Krishna went toMathura when He was five years and one month old. He neverreturned to Gokula. Did you not play with your sisters whenyou were five years old? Can this be perceived as immoral?When Pareekshit asked Suka about Krishna’s behavior, Sukaexplained it to him in the same way. Suka was a celibate. Aperfect celibate delighted in Krishna’s sports with the gopikas.Isn’t this surprising? Suka said, “Pareekshit! Do you seeKrishna as God or as a man? If you consider Him God, youcannot entertain such low feelings. These defects are really inyou. You see your own faults outside you as reflection, reac-tion, and resound. Even if dirt approaches God, it will turn intopurity.”Summer Showers in Brindavan 199593Brahmaanandam Parama Sukhadam, Kevalam JnaanaMoortim, Dvandvaateetam Gagana Sa-drisham, ThathThwam Asyaadi Lakshyam, Ekam Nityam VimalamAchalam, Sarvaadhi Saakshi Bhootam, BhaavaateetamTriguna Rahitam....“Ever blissful, granting happiness, embodiment of wis-dom, beyond duality, infinite as the sky, primordial, fi-nal goal, One, eternal, stainless, immovable, omnipres-ent witness, beyond feeling, devoid of the three gu-nas”—such is God.God is an ocean. The feelings and desires of devoteesare streams. When both merge, the ocean remains the same butthe streams get purified. The ocean is never disturbed. Anotherexample. If you mix one cup of milk in ten cups of water, youdecrease the value of milk. But when one cup of water is mixedwith ten cups of milk, the worthless water acquires the value ofmilk. Thus, when two entities merge, the purer and greater onelends its qualities to the other.God is beyond the three gunas. Will He behave like onetrapped in gunas? Whatever thoughts anyone entertained to-wards Krishna, He was totally pure and unattached. It is truethat the gopikas related to the body of Krishna but even thatwas not in any immoral sense. The gopikas were pure and un-sullied. The meaningless interpretations of scholars havestained people’s perceptions of the Bhagavatham. God is everpure and selfless. These scholars cheat people when they lookupon God as anything less than Purity itself.The return of Dhruva94Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995The tender heart of Dhruva set an example for every-one. Dhruva started back toward his father’s kingdom. Ut-taanapaada was informed. In great excitement, Uttaanapaadasat in a palanquin with Suniti, Suruchi, and Uttama and set outto welcome Dhruva. As Dhruva walked through the forest helooked like a luminous star. He had so much brightness! Hewas only five years old. Skipping and jumping, he laughed inpure joy as he ran home.Uttaanapaada jumped down from his chariot and ranforward to embrace Dhruva. He lifted Dhruva in his arms andsaid, “Forgive my faults, son. To me you are Narayana Him-self. Falling prey to attachment, I was unfair with you. I madeyour mother suffer in many ways.” Dhruva replied, “Who amI? Who are you? You are not the father, I am not the son. I amNarayana, you are Narayana, everything is Narayana. Where isthe question of pardon?” Speaking of unity of the Atma,Dhruva melted his father’s heart. He taught Atma Vidya even tohis father!Uttaanapaada said, “Enough time has been wasted al-ready. Come now.” He sat in the palanquin and took Dhruvaon one thigh and Uttama on the other. In this manner theyreached the kingdom full of joy and excitement. Suniti wit-nessed this scene. She had been away from her husband, andher son was in the forest. She had endured a lot of pain. Shehad spent the many months wondering, “I don’t know whatsins have brought upon me this suffering—the pain of separa-tion from my husband and my son. Which woman can live inthis manner?” This Suniti, who had been submerged in despair,Summer Showers in Brindavan 199595could not contain her joy and excitement on this day. She alsotook Dhruva in her arms and played with him joyously.Dhruva’s penance had lasted five months. He camehome when he was five years and five months old. And he wascrowned as the emperor when he was only six years old! Ut-taanapaada rightly realized that for one who had realized God,it was not a big task to rule over a kingdom. During the corona-tion, Uttama held the royal umbrella over Dhruva’s head whileUttaanapaada and his wives sat on either side of him. The par-ents felt, “If our son, so tender and young, could achieve God’sGrace, why should we waste our time? Human life is not forenjoying wealth and comfort, but to reach God.”Only then did Uttaanapaada recognize the true meaningof the term manuja (man). Manuja = Manu + Ja (born of),meaning, child of Manu. All humans should behave like chil-dren of Manu, embodying his characteristics. Manu alwaysfollowed dharma. He defined justice for the good of humanity.The law followed in every court today is based on Manu’s ex-position. Thus, it is our duty to practice dharma as laid downby Manu. After Dhruva’s coronation, that very day, his fatherand mothers left for Skanda Ashrama to spend the remainder oftheir lives in solitude and meditation.Dhruva ruled for many years and won the love of hissubjects by ensuring their happiness. He waited patiently forhis merger with the Lord, recalling the Lord’s promise. Duringhis last moments a chariot came from the Lord to take him.Dhruva told the charioteer, “Where do I need to go? Why do Ineed to go, when God is everywhere?” He taught the Supreme96Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Truth even to the charioteer sent by God! “You expect me togo to God in this chariot. That is meaningless. God is here, asHe is everywhere. I will merge into Him now,” he said. He satdown in the chariot and chanted Om Namo BhagavateVaasudevaaya. The light in him merged into the Lord.The power of devotionSuch sweet, blissful and dharmic stories are found no-where except in the Bhagavatham. You heard the Lord tellingSage Durvasa yesterday that even God’s Will pales before thepower of devotion. God says, “I will gladly accept defeat butnever let a devotee down. I am a servant of My devotees. Iwait day and night as a watchman in the prayer room of Mydevotee! Do you know why? My devotee could express anydesire at any time. I want to be present to fulfill his slightestwish. I am the final authority everywhere—except with mydevotee. My devotee alone has the final say.”Through His actions, God has always demonstratedthat there is no force greater than the power of devotion. Whatis bhakti, devotion? Bhagavad anurakti (attachment to God) isbhakti. Within bhakti are contained bhukti (food), rakti (de-sires), yukti (cleverness), anurakti (attachment, love), virakti(detachment), and mukti (liberation).Where did the word bhakti originate? Man’s primaryneed is food, bhukti. Sareera Maadhyam Khalu Dharma Sand-hanam—the body is a means for observing dharma and it needsfood. Next, man needs rakti, desire. The third is yukti, worldlyintelligence. It is necessary to know how to live in this world.Next comes anurakti—we must love all without distinction.Summer Showers in Brindavan 199597These are followed by virakti and mukti. In all these words, thecommon syllable is “kti”, “Bha” from Bhagavan (God), and“kti” from these words combine to form bhakti.Therefore, He who grants you bhakti, rakti, yukti,anurakti, virakti, and mukti is God. Bhakti is not limited toperforming worship, doing aarati and so on. We must offerourselves to God! We must hold on to Prema in all situations.This is bhakti.Dhruva attained victory in every test. He was only fiveyears old. Boys of that age enter our Primary School in the 1stStandard. Meaning, this 1st Standard boy showed such greatdedication. Where did Dhruva obtain such strength? Heachieved everything with DETERMINATION. We mustachieve with determination also—achieve not worldly victories,but God Himself. We should not fear troubles and give up.Only then our devotion will be blessed with strength fromGod. For everything, pure Love is the basis.A devotee approached Ramakrishna Paramahamsa andasked, “Master, how can I see God?” Ramakrishna replied, “Omadman, you cry for wife, children, and wealth. All your griefis wasted. Cry for God instead. Then you will achieve His Vi-sion, without a doubt.” Therefore, we should not cry forworldly ends. “Naara” is water, and “Nayana” means eyes.The naara flowing from your nayana must be offered to noneother than Narayana! These are tears of joy.Only tears of joy (Ananda), not tears of misery, cantransport us into the Anandamaya Kosa—the sheath of Bliss.98Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Everyone must go beyond the annamaya kosa, pranamayakosa, manomaya kosa, and vijnaanamaya kosa and reach theanandamaya kosa. You must try in all possible ways toachieve Bliss. For everything, God’s Grace is the foundation.Become worthy of His Grace.

Priyavrata and Jada BharataSukhaarthi Tyajate Vidya.Vidyaarthi Tyajate Sukham.Sukhaarthinah Kuto Vidyaa.Kutah Kuto Vidyaarthinah Sukham. One who craves pleasure is not able to pursue educa-tion.A true student renounces worldly pleasures.One who desires comfort cannot obtain true education.And comfort is not necessary to acquire education.The human body is given for a purpose, not for the en-joyment of worldly joys. Craving for worldly joys is an animalquality. Priyavrata was a man who understood these truths.Every human life has a purpose, a meaning. Recognize the pur-pose of your life and achieve it. A life without a goal is an ani-mal’s life, a foolish life.Prince PriyavrataPriyavrata felt strongly, “Having taken a human birth, itis improper of me to desire physical comforts.” Priyavrata wasthe second son of Manu. Yesterday you understood the natureof Dhruva, the son of Uttaanapaada. Today, grasp the charac-ter of Priyavrata, the younger brother of Uttaanapaada.Physical pleasures are like dreams. They are ephemeraland unreal. All dream experiences are non-existent in the wak-ing state. Similarly, all the joys of this world cannot conferhappiness on the Atma. Recognizing this, Priyavrata sacrificedall comforts, left his kingdom and departed for the forest. Atwhat age? At the age of nineteen years. Today, no one of thatage even attempts to sacrifice worldly comforts. They believe100Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995that youth is the time to indulge in physical pleasures to thefull extent.Not so with Priyavrata. He entered the forest to sanc-tify his time in Divine contemplation, to dedicate his life to thesearch for God. He ceaselessly meditated on God, picturing theLord’s form in his mind to the exclusion of all other thoughts.Students of ancient IndiaWorldly people are bound in the ideas of “I” and“Mine.” Thus, they invite sorrow and waste their valuable life-times. Man is trapped because he does not recognize the cor-rect approach to deal with the feelings of “I” and “Mine”. Heconsiders “I” to be the body and “Mine” to be his physicalpossessions. This misinterpretation leads him astray. “I” is theAtma. “Mine” refers to the body. The correct attitude is: “I(Atma) must use my possession (body) for knowing myself. Ishould dedicate actions to myself (Atma) and not to my pos-session (body).” “Mine” refers to kshetra while “I” is theKshetrajna.1 The kshetra is only a tool to know the Kshetra-jna. Priyavrata realized that the body was given to know theIndweller, not to enjoy the world. This is the difference be-tween the students of today and students of ancient India.Today, students set their aspirations on the physicalworld. They believe worldly joys to be true and lasting. Theydedicate their time, body and actions to the pursuit of tempo-rary happiness. But ancient students trusted that the Atmaalone is permanent. They understood that the body was givento realize the Atma and exerted their utmost to experience innerbliss after renouncing external joys. For many years, PriyavrataSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995101ate only roots and tubers, drank only water and underwentgreat austerities to secure knowledge of the Atma. He sat alonein caves and purified his mind. Purity of the mind is most im-portant for the vision of the Atma.What causes impurity of the mind? Attachment toworldly objects through the senses. We should not allow thesenses to follow objects and pleasures. These ephemeral ob-jects attract man in a variety of ways. Falling prey to attrac-tion, man is cheated of Bliss. Objects are alluring, no doubt, butthey bind and trap. The seriousness of the bondage is not ap-parent initially. Priyavrata realized the supreme importance ofsense control. The same idea was taught by Kapila Muni2when he said, Yogah Chitta Vritti Nirodhakah—sense control isthe greatest yoga. Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam—yoga is alsoskill in action, which sense control bestows.Narada teaches PriyavrataPriyavrata determined to achieve nothing less than per-fection in yoga. He didn’t go home for many years. Manu wentin search of him, pleaded and even ordered him to return, butwithout success. “I have no interest in the kingdom. I don’teven know myself. How can I understand the people and givethem satisfaction? I’m sorry. This task of administration is be-yond me,” Priyavrata told Manu flatly. With no alternative,Manu continued to rule the world.One day Narada saw Emperor Manu in the throes ofdepression and inquired, “O Emperor! There is no dearth ofanything in your kingdom. Why this dejection?” It was usualfor Narada to probe into others’ affairs to ensure their welfare!102Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Manu said, “My son Priyavrata does not agree with me. I wanthim to rule this kingdom. Please help me convince him.” Whatother work does Narada have, anyway? He went to Pri-yavrata’s cave and taught him at length: “O foolish boy! Godhas given us a body for a task. You can experience Divinity byusing the body in worldly duties while keeping the mind fo-cused on the Lord.” Priyavrata asked, “How is that possible?”Narada explained, “Your prime duty is to obey God’scommand. God bestowed this body on you for certain duties.Will God give you a body for no reason? Each individual bodyhas its responsibility. Each responsibility has a goal. You are aprince. Your dharma lies in administering your kingdom. Returnhome, initiate projects for public welfare and make your sub-jects happy. Redeem your life in this manner.You have seen how a farmer controls his bulls by ropes.When he tugs at the rope tied to the left horn, the bull turnsleft. He pulls the rope on the right side to make the bull turnright. When both ropes are pulled, the bull moves straightahead. Similarly, human life is controlled by the ropes of duty.God pulls these ropes to steer people along the path of theirindividual responsibilities. Thus, performing your duty isobeying God. Do not stand in the way of God’s decisions. Donot be a traitor to your true Self. Obey the divine command.”Priyavrata could not disobey Narada or the Lord. Hetook Narada’s teaching to heart and returned to the kingdom.Manu established both his sons as kings and retired to the for-est of Saunikaaranya. In deference to Narada and Manu, Pri-yavrata ruled the kingdom for a few years. But he could notSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995103continue for long. He felt joyous only in solitude. He recog-nized that true spiritual practice is difficult, if not impossible,in the midst of people, objects and worldly activities.Human attachment vs. divine attachmentMore human attachment means less divine attachment.The more we yield to the attraction of worldly joys, the moreour one-pointedness declines. The root causes of all sorrow are(1) attraction to worldly objects and (2) attachment arisingfrom human relationships.Priyavrata realized that each person has come to thisworld for himself, not for anyone else. There is no lasting bondbetween people. A traveler reaches an inn. He meets othertravelers there. The next day, each one departs to their owndestination. Scores of birds collect on a tree at sunset. At dawn,they fly away in their individual directions. Devotees shouldnot lose focus of why they are here and where they are headed.Your journey is eternal—cultivate eternal qualities, not attach-ment. Today we behave like animals by giving too much impor-tance to the body. We should progress from animal to human,then from human to Divine. For these reasons, Priyavratalonged for solitude and left his kingdom eventually.Rushika succeeded Priyavrata as King. Rushika wasalso a seeker of the Atma. But he did not consider it necessaryto renounce the kingdom to perform spiritual effort. He spenthis days ruling efficiently, purifying his mind and performingspiritual inquiry. He maintained a harmonious balance betweenworldly and spiritual duties. Rushika’s son was the famedBharata.104Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995The story of Jada BharataBharata was truthful and honest. He took excellent careof his subjects. He performed actions only after thinking ofGod. He never did even the smallest action, like drinking water,without offering it to God. At all times, in all situations,Bharata never forgot God. It is said that Bharath (India) isnamed after him. After many years as monarch, Bharata handedover the kingdom to his son and went to Rishikesh3 where hebuilt a hermitage for himself. Having severed all worldly at-tachments, he passed his days meditating on the Lord.One day, Bharata was sitting on the banks of the Gangaand watching the waves of the river. He reflected about the upsand downs of the waves being like the joys and sorrows in life.To him, the waves had consciousness. He felt that everythingin Creation had awareness and was a form of God. While hecontemplated in this manner, he heard a loud roar—the roar ofa lion. Meanwhile, a doe had come there to drink water. Shealso heard the roar, panicked and jumped into the river. Shewas in the final stages of pregnancy. The fear and physicalstress of the situation caused her baby deer to be delivered im-mediately. The doe was swept away in the river’s current butBharata was able to reach out and save the baby deer.Bharata cleaned the deer, took it back to his hermitageand began tending it with parental affection. Now all his timewas occupied in attending to this deer. If the deer wasn’t in hissight, it was in his mind. Feeding it milk, collecting grass for it,cleaning it—He wasted all his time in such activities. Bharata’sattachment for the deer kept increasing and consequently,Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995105thoughts of God decreased. He thought of the deer constantly.A few years passed in this manner. When Bharata’s death cameunexpectedly, he took his last breath while thinking fondly ofthe deer and calling it by name.Practice remembrance of GodWhat is the inner meaning of this story? Bharata left hisbody at a time when he was incapable of entertaining elevatingthoughts. His final thought was about the deer and so, he wasborn as a deer in his next life. But he was able to remember hispast life and the needless attachment. “My mind, which de-lighted in thoughts of God, fell prey to attachment for an ani-mal. How foolish! What a pitiable life I am leading now,” heregretted. Such are the disastrous consequences of uncontrolledattachment.That is why when Bharathiyas go on pilgrimage toKasi,4 we find dying people repeating the name of God con-tinuously. No one can tell if the Divine Name will come toone’s lips at the final moment. So, these bedridden people havesomeone whispering into their ears, the mantra:Sri Rama Rama Rameti, Rame Raame ManorameSahasra Naama Tattulyam, Rama Naama Varaanane.The repetition of the name “Rama” once is equal to re-peating the entire Vishnu Sahasra nama (thousandnames of Vishnu).Whatever thought you entertain last, you will achievethat form in your next birth. The contemplation (smarana)done during your lifetime becomes your sole ornament (aabha-106Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995rana) after death. If you remember the Lord’s name throughoutyour life, it will be easy to recall it in your last moments.Some people do not agree. They say, “If we must prac-tice japa in youth, when are we to enjoy the world? When Ihave nothing to do after retirement, I will begin japa.” This isfoolishness. Suppose a man joins the army. If he is given a gunon his first day and asked to go to battle, he will be confused!He must undergo rigorous training in a variety of martial skills.With diligent practice over many years, he will become a goodsoldier. For this reason, Krishna talked about the importance ofpractice in the Gita.Practice (abhyasa) is very essential. Even mundane ac-tivities like walking, talking, speaking, reading, writing arebased on practice. We must prepare for death also by con-stantly remembering the Lord’s Name and Form. Only then isit possible to recollect Him in our final moments. Therefore,practice, practice, practice, from a tender age. This is the mainsignificance of the story of Bharata.Rebirth as “Jada” BharataAfter his life as a deer, Bharata was born as a brahmin. Recall-ing his past mistake, he resolved not to cultivate attachment toanyone. He decided that this would be his repentance, althoughhis mistake was done unknowingly. So he behaved like a vege-table. If anyone called him, he did not respond. Whatever any-one said to him, he didn’t pay attention. People thought he wasdeaf and dumb, but Jada5 Bharata was unmoved.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995107He stuck to the faith that he was not the body. Memo-ries of valuable time wasted in previous births disturbed him tono end. He left the city and went into the forest. He spentmany years living under trees. Thoughts of God were foremostin his mind.In the forest lived a gang of robbers. The leader of thegang had no children. Someone advised him that if he sacrificeda human being to Goddess Kali, he would obtain a son. So theleader commanded his henchmen to catch a healthy man for thispurpose. The robbers spread out in the forest and begansearching. Jada Bharata was seated under a tree. The robbersfound him and carried him to their leader. Bharata hadn’t had abath for a long time. He was dirty. They took him to a riverand forcibly bathed him. They applied sandalwood paste onhis body and decorated him like a sacrificial offering. Bharatawas not mindful of their actions or the reasons for those ac-tions. The robbers took him to the temple of Kali. They askedhim to sit down and he complied. They lifted a sword to be-head him.As the sword was about to strike, Goddess Kali ap-peared. She came walking from the inner enclosure of the tem-ple and slew the entire gang of thieves. Then the Mother God-dess blessed Bharata with words of advice: “I am very pleasedwith your devotion and perseverance. Continue in this manner,and establish yourself in the Self. Don’t worry what the worldthinks of you. Be unaffected by praise and blame. Be fearless.Think of the Lord all the time.” But Jada Bharata did not evenhear Her! He was engrossed in the Atma, without interruption.108Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Then Mother Kali disappeared. Bharata walked out of thetemple, still engrossed in the Atma.On another occasion, Rahuguna, King of Sindhu-Sauvari, was passing by in a palanquin. Bharata was seated un-der a tree. The palanquin-bearers found the palanquin veryheavy and accosted Bharata to lend them a hand. They draggedhim from his spot and placed the palanquin on his shoulders.Bharata quietly obeyed. But before taking every step, he wouldmake sure he wasn’t stepping on any insect, since he perceivedthe Atma in every being. Sarva Bhoota Antaraatma Param-aatma—God is the Indweller in all beings. This truth was rec-ognized by Bharata. The feeling of unity—that no being shouldbe harmed—was steadfast in him. Bharata’s caution caused thepalanquin to be slow and jerky. The king got angry, “Hey,men! Why are you walking so strangely?” The bearers said, “OKing! This new man is responsible,” pointing to Bharata.The king turned to Bharata and abused him at length,calling him a “walking corpse”. Then Bharata opened hismouth, “O King! Not only this body but all bodies are walkingcorpses. Yes, the body is walking, but it is only a sava (deadbody). The One making all bodies walk, the only One alive, isShiva. Bodies are inert. The inner consciousness is God.” Theking heard these words and commanded the palanquin to belowered.Rahuguna was actually on his way to see Sage Kapila tolearn about the Atma. He stepped down in humility and said,“Kapila himself has appeared to me here.” He sat with Bharataand clarified his understanding of the Atma. Jada Bharata taughtSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995109him Atma Vidya in a clear, lucid manner. Rahuguna was over-whelmed by Bharata’s teachings and fell at his feet.Vasanas—remnants of desiresJada Bharata’s wisdom spread all over India. His mainteachings for eradication of worldly attachments were (1) con-trol of the senses and (2) ceiling on desires. We should not letdesires grow without limit. Desires alone are responsible forour joy and sorrow. One who desires is not a devotee. The onewho works with an expectation in mind is not a devotee. Youmust work for others, for God.You may chant the Vedas morning to night, know allthe scripture, undertake various sadhanas or performyagnas—God will not be achieved by any of these activities.This was the truth taught by Jada Bharata. These acts are onlyfor mental satisfaction. How far is their reach, how permanentis their effect? This body composed of desires can neverachieve God—Bharata recognized this truth.An example. A camphor box has the smell of camphoreven after all the camphor is removed. The body is a containersmelling of sensual pleasures. Even after desires are curbed,vasanas (remnants of desire) exist. As long as the slightest tingeof desire exists, vasanas will prevail. As long as vasanas exist,one cannot reach God. So, patiently maintain self-effort withdetermination till the final trace of desire is erased. This is AtmaBodha—Teaching of the Atma.Pray to God for God110Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Man has not taken birth to cultivate and satisfy desires.A life based on desires is narrow. Human life is meant to be assacred and infinite as our innate Divinity. Do not pray to Godwith desires. “Lord, if I pass this exam, I’ll break two coconutsfor You.” Is God short of coconuts? Will He satisfy your de-sires in fond anticipation of your coconuts? People go to Tiru-pathi and pray, “O Venkateswara!6 Fulfill my desire and I willgive you every hair on my head.” What good is your hair to theLord? You entertain rotten desires and hold your rotten hair asransom! No, no. This is not true prayer. It is only begging,with selfishness as the motive.A servant works hard all day. But in the evening, hecomes to the master and demands wages. One who demandscompensation is an outsider, a paid servant. The wife and chil-dren also work hard at home. But does the wife demand wagesat the end of the day? No. She is an owner, not a servant. Thewife and children work out of a sense of duty. Those who re-alize that their primary duty is to dedicate their lives to Godqualify as “owners.”Therefore, do not pray to God with desires. You shouldbe able to assert, “I pray to You for You! I do not want any-thing else.” This truth was propagated by Jada Bharata. Withsuch sublime teachings, Bharata succeeded in destroying thefalse pride and excessive desire in many kings of his time.Karma is inescapableWhy was Bharata able to teach the kings of his time?Because he had experienced and overcome these obstacles him-self. At one time, he used to delight in thoughts of God. ThenSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995111he fell to the status of an animal. He toiled to regain his originalstate of detachment and devotion. Thus, Bharatapreached—Karma cannot be escaped at any time, in any place.Good for good, bad for bad, you are bound to reap what yousow.Karma daata vasamaa, narudaa, karma daatavasamaa?Ghana paathambulu chadivina kaanee,Kula devatalanu kolachina kaanee,Kaaradavulake poyina kaanee,Kathina tapassule chesina kaanee,Karma daata vasamaa, narudaa, karma daatavasamaa?Is it possible to evade karma, O man, is it possible?You may have studied all the scriptures,Pleased your family deities,Departed into forests,Performed austere penance,But, is it possible to evade karma, O man, is it possi-ble?Chinna chelimilo munchina kaanee,Enni samudramul ninchina kaanee,Kadavento ra, Neerante ra,Kaavaalannanu ekkuva raadu ra,Karma daata vasamaa, narudua, karma daatavasamaa?Whether you dip it in a small pond,Or in a mighty ocean,112Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995As is the container, so is the amount of water you col-lect.You cannot get more, even if you want.Is it possible to evade karma, O man, is it possible?Your experiences and your destiny are only as grand asthe size of your heart. To gain more peace and bliss, expandyour heart. Many millionaires have become paupers and pau-pers have become rich. These are consequences of God’s grace,not results of your desires. Jada Bharata told the kings, “Youdo not get joy by desiring it. Joys and sorrows come by them-selves, as they please. They may come alone or even together!So, increase the size of your heart.”Limit your desires to acquire a pure mind. More desiresmean more pollution of your mind. A dirty mind can nevercontemplate on God.Uplift yourself by practiceAll your sadhana must be directed to achieving Godalone. You must uplift yourself. No one else will do it for you.Uddharet Atmanaatmaanam.7 Raise yourself by your own ef-forts. Consider a guidepost on the road. It points to Chikbal-lapuram in one direction, to Belathuru in another direction andso on. Destinations are indicated, but walking is still required!And the one who should walk is yourself. In the same way,reading scriptures and undertaking different sadhanas are of noavail till you contemplate on Divinity with a pure heart.Today men read sacred texts but without faith. A stu-dent requested his teacher, “Guru Ji! I’ve been reading theSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995113Bhagavad Gita for twenty years. I know all 700 verses byheart. But I haven’t acquired any good fruits from this effort.Please prescribe a mantra by which I can get results.” Theteacher exclaimed, “Get out, you madman! You have beenreading the Gita—instructions of the Lord Himself. You haveno faith in the Lord’s words, and you profess faith in some ob-scure mantra? If you followed the Gita sincerely, why wouldyou need a mantra? What good is a mantra to one who has nofaith in the Lord?” People today also do not follow teachings.As a result, their mantras, japa, yagnas, pilgrimages ... all are awaste.When we put teachings into practice, the unity ofthought, word and deed must be present. While reciting a man-tra, we must demonstrate its meaning in action. Only then canwe win the fruit of the mantra.One student learnt about the nature of Divinity. Heheard his teacher often speaking of the mantra Shivoham,which means, “I am Shiva.” So he began reciting it all day. Apasser-by was intrigued.He asked the boy, “Son, where did you learn this man-tra?” The boy replied, “From a great teacher.” “What doesShivoham mean?” “It means—I am Shiva.” “Indeed, you areShiva. So how is Goddess Parvathi related to you?” “How sin-ful, how sinful,” the student exclaimed.If the boy considered himself Shiva, then Parvathiwould be his wife, wouldn’t she? However, with faith, the stu-dent would have realized that Parvathi and all of Creation are114Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Shiva as well! We must recognize that all powers reside withinus. Merely reciting mantras without experiencing their signifi-cance is a waste of time.Students, you have seen that the descendants of Manuwere seekers of Atma Jnana. They attained and delighted inAtma Jnana. Not just Manu’s family, but all characters of theBhagavatham were pure. Unfortunately, scholars misinterpretBhagavatham and disparage God. The great devotees of theBhagavatham considered their bodies as God’s property andthe Indweller as Divine. They rightly recognized the body to belike a bulb and the inherent Divinity to be like the current.Balance worldly studies and Atma VidyaTherefore, students should not pursue education withonly worldly happiness in mind. Students constantly ask,“What job will this study equip me for? How much will I earn?What lifestyle could I sustain?” They are busy planning theirfuture, but not bothering to understand the meaning of educa-tion. They expect to become highly-paid executives after se-curing MBA degrees. They think, “I will command a monthlysalary of Rs. 5000, 10000, even 20000.” But they have no mo-tivation to apply their skills towards social welfare.It is wrong to think, “What can I get from society?”With proliferation of useless education, security is absent inBharath. Why? Because educated people are like thieves, feed-ing off society for their costly lifestyles. It is only uneducatedpeople who are trying to render service to society as per theircapacity. With worldly studies, pursue Atma Vidya as well.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995115Then you will find ways to deliver peace and security to soci-ety, thus lending meaning to your life.I do not ask that you earn high positions or wealth.Authority comes and goes. Become ideal men andwomen—this is what I desire for you. The characters in theBhagavatham are immortal for their glorious deeds. You heardthe stories of nineteen-year-old Priyavrata and Dhruva, a merefive-year-old boy! Their virtues are sung thousands of yearsafter their times. Imagine, how sacred and pure they must havebeen, for their names to be taken with reverence in this KaliYuga!We also hear of Einstein and Newton—great scientists.They have come and gone. But where are their names? Einsteinis mentioned in scientific discussions, no doubt. But when wetalk of other subjects, like art, Einstein is nowhere. However,exalted beings like Dhruva and Jada Bharata shine constantly inthe hearts of young and old, paupers and millionaires alike.I do not say that you should neglect or renounce yourstudies. No. But do not consider them as the main purpose oflife. Education without contemplation on God is useless. Culti-vate Divine Love like these great devotees and make your livesmeaningful. In ancient India, even young boys had great renun-ciation. Not just boys, girls were exemplary also. So, boys andgirls, follow the ideals of Atma Vidya, fulfill your own lives andset ideal examples to society. Blessing you with this expecta-tion, I conclude My discourse.116Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995

Kshetra (field) and Kshetrajna (“Knower of the field”) are terms used inBhagavad Gita (Ch. XIII) to represent the body and the Indwelling Atma,respectively. Swami explains that a field is symbolic of sowing and reap-ing. With the body, man sows good/bad actions and reaps correspondingresults.2. An Avatar of Lord Vishnu also mentioned in Bhagavatham.3. Holy city on the banks of River Ganga.4. The city of Varanasi, holy  to  Hindus.5. Jada = dumb, inert, non-living.6.

VishwamitraNaasti Lobha Samo VyaadhihNaasti Krodha Samo Ripuh.Naasti Daaridryavat DukhamNaasti Jnaana Samo Sukham.There is no disease like greed,No enemy like anger,No sorrow greater than poverty,No happiness equal to wisdom.Everyone strives to acquire happiness and to removemisery, but is unsuccessful. Creation is vast and endless. Manis just a tiny part of the Cosmos and therefore, should lead hislife in keeping with the welfare of all. Instead, man believes thatCreation is meant for his own enjoyment, and exploits it. Justas a child draws milk from its mother and a bee draws nectarfrom a flower, man can also draw necessary resources from Na-ture.The importance of limitsThese days we see Nature revolting by way of disastersbecause man ignores all limits in exploiting its resources. Tor-rential rain, drought, earthquakes, floods—such are the reper-cussions of man’s greed. On account of scientific progress, sci-entists have grown selfish without regard for the world’s wel-fare. They provoke Nature to retaliation.The Bhagavatham says, Durlabho Maanusha Jan-mah—a human birth is difficult to acquire. Viveka Choodamanisays, Jantoonaam Nara Janma Durlabham—A human birth israrest among all beings. The Puranas teach that among the8,400,000 species of beings in the world, humans are the most118Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995evolved. When we ponder over these scriptural statements, werealize how pure, valuable and sacred human life is. Today wehave forgotten that a human birth is priceless, potentially Di-vine and full of Bliss. Thus we invite sorrow upon ourselves.For happiness and sorrow, your behavior alone is re-sponsible, not anyone else. People are unable to believe thisfact. With pure conduct, you can acquire all the happiness andcomfort you desire. Your desires also must be within limits ifyou want peace of mind. Men are going mad since they do notlimit unreasonable desires.The story of King TrisankuIn the Chandravamsha1 there was an emperor calledTrisanku. He was a great King in every way. He was truthful,an embodiment of dharma, and he treated his subjects as ifthey were his own children. His heart was full of compassion.In spite of his excellent qualities, Trisanku could not limit onepeculiar desire that found a way into his heart: He yearned todwell in heaven in his physical body.To this end, Trisanku went to his family guru, SageVashishta. He said, “Respected Guru, please help me achievethis desire and bring fulfillment into my life.” Vashishta re-marked, “Shame on you! Your desire is unnatural. This body isdirty. It is the home of mucus, waste matter, and disease. Totake this ephemeral body to the heavenly realms is like dragginga corpse along with you. People earn heaven after good actionsand yagnas done over many lifetimes. It is impossible to takethe physical body there. It is against God’s rules for Creationto even attempt it. This thought is not worthy of you. I cannotSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995119help you. If you are adamant, you may approach anothersage.”Trisanku went home dejected. After some time he jour-neyed northward. He went to meet the bright, austere, power-ful and highly esteemed sons of Vashishta. The sons of Vash-ishta had surpassed even their father! No one was greater thanthem in wisdom, fame, and austerity. Trisanku told them hisproblem as well as Vashishta’s words. They said, “Trisanku!Our father is your personal guru and the guru of your dynasty.By coming to us, you have disobeyed him, insulted him. Whywould we overrule our father? Do you want us to go againstour father like you did? There is no place among us for a disci-ple who doesn’t value his guru’s words. Go away!”Trisanku had nowhere to go. So he went to Kausika.2This Kausika was also a King originally. But his kingly pridetook a fall when he opposed Vashishta’s spiritual power. So, atthat time, he was engaged in arduous penance for spiritualpowers. Kausika decided to satisfy Trisanku at any cost, onlybecause Vashishta had refused to do so. Why? Kausika hatedand envied Vashishta intensely. Vashishta was a Brahmarishi3while he was only a Rajarishi.4Kausika had exerted tremendously to achieve the statusof a Brahmarishi, but had failed till then. What was the reason?His hatred, anger, and jealousy prevented him from advancingbeyond the stage of Rajarishi. One who harbors anger and jeal-ousy can never prosper. He can never achieve his goals. Thereis no enemy greater than anger. There is no disease greater thanenvy. There is a medicine for every disease but none for jeal-120Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995ousy. And Trisanku sought help from Kausika, in whom somany bad qualities were present.Kausika assured him, “I will send you to heaven inyour physical body without fail!” He began planning a yagnaand summoned many rithwiks.5 None of them approved of thisyagna, but they still came, fearing Kausika’s wrath. Kausikawas anger personified. The rithwiks did not want to be burnt inthe fire of his anger. They told themselves, “Let us just gothere quietly and do our job.”The yagna to send Trisanku to heaven began. NoDevas6 were seen approaching to accept the offerings of theyagna. Kausika understood that the Devas disapproved of Tri-sanku’s motive. He decided to send Trisanku to heaven solelyby the power of his penance. He poured all his spiritual pow-ers into a wooden staff. Then, holding the staff aloft, he an-nounced, “Trisanku! I command you to ascend to heaven.” Tri-sanku began rising in the air and soon, he went out of sight.Everyone was speechless at this incredible event. After sometime, they heard shouts, “Guru Ji! Guru Ji!” When theylooked up, they saw Trisanku falling down shouting, “Guru Ji!Indra7 did not permit me to enter heaven. What should I do? Iawait your command.”Kausika was incensed at the audacity of the Devas whohad refused admission to his supplicant. He said, “You staythere, don’t come down.” With Trisanku as the central point,Kausika began creating a second universe by the strength of hisspiritual power! He created new Sun, Moon, planets, stars,Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995121heaven, and so on. But the Devas looked upon these creationsas artificial and ignored them.The story of SunassephaWhile Trisanku was in that state, his son Harischandraruled the kingdom. This was not Sathya Harischandra, who isfamous for his truthfulness! His name was Harischandra, that’sall! This Harischandra prayed to Lord Varuna8 for a son. Hepromised that he would surrender the son to Varuna soon afterhe was born. Varuna heard his prayer and a son was born in afew months. The son was named Rohita. Harischandra couldnot bring himself to give Rohita away to Varuna. He reneged onhis promise. Rohita came to know of his father’s mistake. Hethought, “I wonder what calamities might beset me in thiskingdom,” and ran away to the forest. He spent many yearswandering aimlessly, subsisting on roots and tubers. Mean-while, as a consequence of breaking his promise, Harischandrawas afflicted with a chronic disease.What is the inner meaning of these stories? The father,Trisanku, nursed a desire that went against the Laws of Nature.The son, Harischandra, did not keep his word. These storiesare told to illustrate the sorrow that ensues from these two ac-tions—breaking one’s word and going against the Divine Law.Everyone, without distinction, must necessarily follow therules and disciplines of Nature. No one has the authority tooppose these rules, which represent the Divine Law. To breaksuch laws is to invite great calamity. This is an importantteaching of the Bhagavatham.122Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Rohita came to know of his father’s disease. He at-tempted to return home many times. But Indra appeared tohim and dissuaded him every time. Rohita considered himselfresponsible for his father’s condition. He continuouslysearched for a solution to this dilemma. He thought about hisfather’s promise to Varuna—One living being had to be offeredto Varuna in a yagna.The father can have love for his sons, no doubt. But itshould be within limits. It should be neither excessive like Dhri-tarashtra’s love, nor deficient like Hiranya Kashyapa’s love.Years roll by and old age arrives, but man’s attachment onlygrows and grows! This is the reason why today’s man experi-ences hell. Why? Attachment and possessiveness alone are re-sponsible for misery. Attachment must have limits. Withoutlimits, man forgets his Divine nature, behaves like an animaland loses respect in society.Rohita resolved to return and put an end to his father’ssuffering. On the way, he met a couple and their three sons.Rohita told them, “I will give you untold wealth and cows andland in exchange for one of your sons. I need a boy for a yagna.Will you give me your oldest son?” The man said, “I love myoldest son immensely. I cannot live without him.” Rohita per-sisted, “How about your youngest son, then?” The wife inter-jected, “He is the darling of my heart. I cannot part with him.”The middle son was not as much loved as the other two. Thefather said, “You can have our second son.”The second son told himself, “How unfortunate I am! Icouldn’t become worthy of my parents’ affection. It is muchbetter to offer my life in a yagna than to live such a life.” HeSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995123went with Rohita of his own volition. This boy was Sunasse-pha. They walked for a long distance and felt tired. They felthungry but could see no human habitation nearby. They no-ticed a hermitage at a distance and ran into it. The hermitagewas the abode of the noble Sage Vishwamitra.Sunassepha spoke his heart to Vishwamitra. “O GreatSage! This is my pitiable situation. Please protect me somehowand make me your disciple,” he pleaded. Vishwamitra assuredhim, “Don’t worry, I will definitely save you.” Immediately hesent for his three sons and instructed, “One of you must agreeto go to the yagna instead of this boy. Harischandra is per-forming a yagna in which one being must be offered to Varuna.Paropakaaraartham Idam Sareeram—Our bodies are meant tobe of service to others. We must be ever ready to give our lifeto protect another’s.” Viswamitra’s sons burst out laughing.“Father, you are ready to sacrifice your own sons for the sakeof some unknown boy? Is this what you are supposed to teachus?” None of them agreed to renounce his life. Then Vishwami-tra called Sunassepha near and said, “Son, two mantras are re-quired for this yagna to be completed. I will teach them to younow. Recite them in the yagna.”Sunassepha learnt the two mantras by heart and pro-ceeded with Rohita. Harischandra’s yagna began. Harischandrafelt guilty that he was ready to sacrifice someone else’s son toVaruna. He recognized his acute selfishness. Rohita also suf-fered terribly with feelings of guilt. But he could not go againsthis father’s order for Sunassepha to be sacrificed.As the yagna neared conclusion, Sunassepha recited hismantras loudly. In that peaceful atmosphere, those mantras124Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995illumined the surroundings. Varuna noticed the brilliance of themantras and descended to the site Himself. Varuna said,“Harischandra! You promised me something and did somethingelse. Your disease is nothing but the fruit of this sinful act. Thegiven word must be upheld. No one is exempt from this injunc-tion. Even at the cost of one’s life, do not go back on yourpromise. Sathyam Naasti Paro Dharmah—There is no dharmahigher than truth. This whole universe has emerged fromsathya, and it merges into sathya ultimately. There is no placein the world without Truth. Instead of protecting and experi-encing Truth, you opposed it and invited misery. However,your son Rohita prayed that Sunassepha should be saved atany cost. Yielding to Rohita’s sraddha9 and pure feelings, Ihave come Myself.” Paying money to buy someone else’s sonand sacrifice him? This is a great sin. The parents also offeredthe son by yielding to greed.We must realize the inner meaning here. Who was theroot cause of all this suffering? It was Trisanku. He wentagainst the Natural Law. He wanted a second creation to bemade just for himself! This is against the Will of God. Thesetraits also appeared in his son to a certain extent. One who op-poses God’s Will cannot survive in this world. To disobey theWill of God is bhagavat-droham and guru-droham, treacherytowards God and guru. Trisanku suffered because he was a trai-tor to God and to his guru. One should be ever obedient toone’s father also. Devotion and obedience to God, father, andguru: these are the hallmarks of Indian Culture. Trisanku wasone who disregarded the sanctity of these three relations.The story of KausikaSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995125Trisanku was only a king. But look at the Sage Kausika!He had immense wisdom and tremendous penance to his credit.Yet, he stooped to the level of helping Trisanku in his ques-tionable desire. Kausika would not have helped Trisanku undernormal circumstances, but his hatred for Vashishta made himtake that step. Hatred clouds discrimination. What is the use ofarduous penance, yagnas and many kinds of education? Kau-sika was a master of all scriptures, possessed boundless spiri-tual power and was an embodiment of dharma. But he allowedhatred into his heart and laid all these virtues to waste. He per-formed a task that even ordinary people would have recognizedas wrong!For this reason Kausika’s respect gradually diminished.Only his penance and powers sustained his waning reputation.Kausika’s penance had jealousy as its foundation. He was jeal-ous that Vashishta had earned the title of Brahmarishi. Despitehis penance, Kausika could not curb his anger. Even afterBrahma appeared to him and honored him with the title of Ra-jarishi, his anger did not subside. Brahma knew that Kausikawas full of Rajo Guna and hence, gave him the title of Rajarishi.One with rajas is a Rajarishi. The one who recognizes the na-ture of Brahman and acts according to the prompting of theAtma is a Brahmarishi.Kausika was originally a king. Many, many years ago,he went to the forest for a hunt. He was exhausted after a fullday of hunting. He came across a hermitage—Sage Vashishta’shermitage. He paid his respects to Vashishta. Enthralled by theserenity and natural beauty of the hermitage, Kausika tarriedthere, conversing with Vashishta. After some time, he re-126Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995quested Vashishta’s permission to return to his city. Vashishtasaid, “You are the emperor of this land. Under your rule, weascetics are able to live peacefully in the forest. Through youradministrative policies, you are ever attentive to the protectionand care of sages. It is our duty to honor our King as a specialguest. You must accept my hospitality.”Kausika said humbly, “Swami! I am not here alone.Thousands of soldiers are with me. If you give me a glass ofwater or milk, that is sufficient. Please don’t trouble yourself.”Vashishta said, “O King! There is no dearth of anything in thishermitage. Where God’s Grace showers, all-round abundancefollows. I am capable of providing hospitality to any numberof your soldiers.” Kausika was surprised. He wondered, “Howis this sage planning to provide my entire army with food?”Kausika’s arrogance rose and he thought, “Let me test thissage.” He agreed to Vashishta’s request.Vashishta called out lovingly, “Sabali, Sabali!” A cowcame there. Vashishta told the cow, “Look here, Sabali. Theking is our guest today. Please arrange for his comfort and thatof his soldiers.” In the twinkling of an eye, everything ap-peared! Sabali was a kamadhenu, a wish-fulfilling cow giftedby Lord Brahma. There was food even for Kausika's elephantsand horses, what to talk of his soldiers and himself! Kausikawas an emperor. But even his royal kitchens had never pro-duced such delicious food. Arrogance and greed entered Kau-sika's heart. He thought, “This miraculous cow must residewith a King, not with a recluse in a forest.”Kausika finished eating. Then he told Vashishta, “OSage! I have a small request. Please give me Sabali.” VashishtaSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995127said, “That is impossible. Sabali is meant to be with me.” Kau-sika tried to convince him in many ways but Vashishtawouldn’t yield. Kausika lost his patience, turned to his soldiersand said, “Drag this cow to our city.” The soldiers began drag-ging Sabali away and she cried out to Vashishta, “Guru Ji!What fault have I done? Why do you let them drag me away?”Vashishta told her, “Here is a king who is proud of hisphysical and intellectual strength, but he has no strength of vir-tue. How can I reason with a king devoid of virtue?” He triedadvising Kausika, but to no avail. Now, Kausika’s army con-sisted of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Who could defysuch a force? Knowing Sabali’s strength, Vashishta told her, “Ipermit you to deal with them as you wish.”All of a sudden, Sabali created a divine army of millionsout of nowhere, which fell upon Kausika’s army. Kausika’smen were annihilated in a matter of minutes. Not a single sol-dier survived. Even the sons of Kausika were not spared! Theonly one left alive was Kausika himself, who returned homehumiliated. Since then, his hatred for Vashishta grew into araging fire.Kausika’s anger and hatred were a curse to him. Vash-ishta was ever peaceful, even during this incident. Vashishtacautioned him, “The angry man cannot succeed. He commitssins and loses his respect. He distances himself from his nearand dear ones and is despised by all. This dire enemy, anger,destroys every happiness of man. Your enemy is within you,not outside.” But Vashishta’s peaceful demeanor and advicewould cause Kausika’s anger to increase even more!128Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995The true meaning of sacrificeWhat is the reason for anger and loss of discrimination?It is only attachment! Why should a prosperous emperor de-sire this cow? He has all comforts in his kingdom. This cowbelonged to the sage and was a Divine blessing for feeding thedenizens of the forest. Why not let the cow dwell where itsservices were most needed? Craving for objects that heshouldn’t desire is the reason for man’s ruin. Bhagavatham isreplete with ideals: (1) Keep your word. (2) Never lie. (3)Limit desires and attachment.Yes, you may have attachment for your wife and chil-dren. But keep it within limits. Not only must you limit yourattachment but limit its duration also. Your householder life isonly till fifty years of age. By sixty years, you must enter Va-naprastha. You should snap ties with wife and children and befree of all responsibilities. The age of seventy years is the timefor complete renunciation (sanyasa).Instead of cultivating such sacrifice, men today refuseto renounce attachments till death. Only hell can result to suchpeople. Help your family and others to the extent possible.Discharge your duties towards everyone. And remember thatevery person is independent, governed by his individualkarma. Everyone is responsible for themself. Don’t cultivateattachment, which is the root cause of sorrow.In this modem age, 99 out of 100 people spend theirlives in attachment. Even those with perfect renunciation inancient Bharath could not escape sorrow! Then how can mod-Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995129ern man, submerged in attachment, expect to live happily? Re-member, each one is responsible for oneself. Develop suchfeelings of sacrifice. For this reason the Vedas advise:Na Karmana Na Prajaya DhanenaTyaagenaike Amritatvamaanashu.Not by good deeds, children or wealth but only by sac-rifice is immortality attained.What is the meaning of “sacrifice”? Attachment (raga)and hatred (dvesha) must be sacrificed. People talk about thenava grahas10 who must be appeased so that our lives are freeof misfortunes. Really, there are not nine, but only two grahasthat we must be mindful of: attachment and hatred! These twoput us through suffering. Renounce attachment and hatred.This alone is true sacrifice, true renunciation:Cultivate thoughts of God and think of everyone’s wel-fare. Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantu—May all theworlds be happy. You must pray in this manner every day. Donot limit yourself to your family, friends, and relatives. Every-one must be happy. With such prayer, victory and peace willfill you!So, gradually strengthen your spirit of sacrifice. What issacrifice? You must sacrifice attachment and hatred. Thesefeelings lie at the root of all possessiveness. If you only give upmoney, clothes, property and possessions —that is not sacri-fice.Decrease attachment to the body130Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Students! Develop this correct outlook from a tenderage. Get rid of bodily attachment gradually, to the extent pos-sible. Use the body merely as a tool to perform your duties.The body has been given for performing actions but it is noteverlasting. Do not develop attachment or pride on its account.The body is like a glass tumbler. It might break at any moment.Body is a water bubble.Mind is a mad monkey.Don’t follow the body.Don’t follow the mind.Follow the conscience.Don’t cultivate attachment to the body beyond limits.That is why our ancient sages went into solitude to overcomebodily attachment. They took care of their bodies but at thesame time, decreased their physical attachment. Those whoaspire for Divinity must necessarily embark on this path.However, if you don’t want God, you can remain preoccupiedwith the body for as long as you wish, because that will giveyou the temporary happiness you seek.One small example: Once, for a mistake, Narada wascursed by Lord Narayana and took birth as a pig. He wallowedin mud all day and it seemed to be Vaikunta11 to him! Then hemarried a she-pig and became a father to nine piglets. This pig-Narada was so happy wading through filth along with his wifeand children. For him, that filth was Vaikunta, his pig-wife wasKailasa12 and his children were heaven! From time to time,Devas would pass-by and remonstrate with him, “What is thispitiable state, Narada? Shed this attachment to a pig’s body.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995131We are on our way to meet Lord Narayana. Realize your trueidentity and come with us.”Then the pig-Narada would reply, “No, no, no! I don’twant your tasteless world. See how happy I am here! My wifeis so beautiful! I have nine children, as glorious as the nineplanets. And the enjoyment of wading in this mud is not avail-able to me even in heaven! How can I simply leave these joysand come away?”What is the lesson here? Who was overcome by at-tachment? None other than Narada, a mentally created son ofBrahma! So, you may definitely have attachment and desires.But limit them. With limited desires, attain the limitless Divin-ity—This is the easy path. If you fail to put a ceiling on de-sires, you distance yourself from God.Students, plan your life along idealistic lines from ayoung age and demonstrate it to society. You definitely havethe freedom and the right to desire the necessities of life. Butdon’t cultivate too many desires. Cut your ego and limit at-tachment, thereby letting Divine feelings flourish. This is whatVedanta13 and the Bhagavatham advise.The Bhagavatham is “His Story”There are many stories, some strange, in Bhagavatham.You might find them long or cumbersome. No, no. They are all“histories”. “History” means “His Story”—stories of God.Unfortunately we are unable to appreciate the Bhagavatham.Hence, we violate its teachings. Truly, every verse of thisscripture is a pearl, a diamond. Bhagavatham was written forthe very purpose of teaching the secrets of attaining God. Oth-132Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995erwise, why would Vyasa sit dispiritedly on the banks of RiverSaraswati after composing the eighteen Puranas, and whywould Narada go there and advise him to compose Bha-gavatham?Narada told Vyasa, “You wrote the Puranas and theMahabharatha and earned the name sloka daata—giver of di-vine verses. But your slokas (divine verses) could not dispelyour soka (sorrow). You inquired into the intentions of thewicked Kauravas and described their characters in the Mahab-haratha. Thus your mind was sullied. To cleanse yourself, nowdescribe the stories of the Lord. Write the Bhagavatham.”There is no text greater than the Bhagavatham. Why? TheBhagavatham alone explains the nature of God in entirety.Give up kama to attain RamaThere was a being who was able to assume differentforms. Assuming the form of a monkey, he went around tellingpeople, “You fools! Look at me. I am a monkey. I dwell insideyou as your mind. I am responsible for your fickleness. Evenmonkeys served Rama despite their unsteadiness. But you menfollow kama14 instead of Rama.”Do you see? Even monkeys were intelligent to serveRama. But men run after kama. They are more foolish thanmonkeys! Desires, desires, desires... How can Rama grant HisVision to one drowned in desires? Decrease your desires gradu-ally. Like the horns of a bull, which grow with age, your desiresare ever-increasing! This is not proper. Human values will de-generate into animal qualities if this trend persists.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995133Students! As much as possible, decrease your desires.Desires are the prime cause of sorrow. The less our desires, themore our bliss. While performing worldly duties, do virtuousactions and think of spiritual matters. Our country is full ofmiserable situations. Students should arm themselves withskills and capacity and rectify these situations.

Hiranya Kashyapa, the brotherof Hiranyaksha, witnessed his brother’s death at the hands ofthe Lord. As a result, he developed anger and hatred toward theLord. He considered Narayana not as God but as a man, anddecided to destroy Him by any means.Hiranya Kashyapa, hater of the LordHiranya Kashyapa ordered all devotees and Vedicpriests to be killed. He destroyed Brahmins on sight. The king-dom fell into chaos. Not able to bear the separation from hisbrother, Hiranya developed many weaknesses. He gave upfood, drink and sleep and questioned all the time, “Where isthis Narayana?” The Lord exists for one who accepts Him butnot for atheists. Yet, He is present in everyone equally. Thebeliever is like a blooming flower while the atheist is a bud. Thebud of today is the flower of tomorrow. But if an insect de-stroys the bud, it cannot become a flower.Hiranya desired immortality. To this end, he left hiskingdom and began performing arduous penance on MountSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995135Mandara. He had three sons: Samhridaya, Nayahridaya andHridaya. When he left his kingdom, his fourth son was in thewomb of his wife, Queen Leelavati. Taking advantage of Hi-ranya’s absence, the Gods attacked his kingdom. They wantedto eradicate demons in the interest of world peace and the es-tablishment of human values. At this point, Sage Narada cameand took Leelavati to the safety of his hermitage.Narada taught Leelavati at length about Lord Narayana.Leelavati pretended to listen to Narada by nodding her head,but inwardly she was worried about her husband’s welfare andconstantly thought of him. However, Leelavati’s child absorbedNarada’s teachings and began to repeat Om Namo Narayanaya,even inside the womb! At birth, this child, Prahlada, had greateffulgence and a cheerful smile.Soon Hiranya returned from Mandara after propitiatingLord Brahma. He had obtained a boon whereby he couldn’t bekilled by any man or animal, on earth or in the sky, by any-thing living or non-living during the day or the night. Hiranyabelieved that he had tricked Brahma into granting him immor-tality by the peculiar conditions of the boon. He began consid-ering himself God and forced everyone to adore him by chant-ing Om Namo Hiranya Kashyapa Namah!Prahlada’s educationPrahlada was old enough to be sent to school. Chandaand Amarka were the gurus assigned to teach him. They taughthim that only artha (wealth) and kama (desire) were impor-tant, not dharma (righteousness) and moksha (liberation).1They also taught that Hiranya was God. Collecting many other136Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995children of demons in their school, Chanda and Amarka taughtthem demonic qualities. Day and night, they rained upon themteachings opposed to Lord Narayana.Empty brains can be filled with anything. But Prah-lada’s heart was full of contemplation on Narayana. He did notimbibe any demonic teachings. Still, he pretended to listen, andthat made the gurus happy. After a few days, the gurus tookPrahlada to his father.Taking Prahlada in his lap with affection, Hiranya askedwhile patting his head, “Son, what did the gurus teach you?”Prahlada said, “Father, I have learnt teachings from thescriptures. I know the nine kinds of devotion:2 sravanam,keerthanam, Vishnu smaranam, padasevanam, vandanam, ar-chanam, dasyam, sakhyam, Atma nivedanam.”Hiranya said, “Indeed, you may reach me by any ofthese paths.” “Not you, father. These are meant for reachingLord Narayana,” replied Prahlada.Hiding his displeasure, Hiranya asked again, “Let mehear you summarize the essence of all scriptures in one sen-tence.”“Om Namo Narayanaya,” said Prahlada.Hiranya Kashyapa became silent. He turned and glaredat the gurus, who looked at each other in bafflement. Theythought, “This boy is a big danger to us,” and felt afraid forSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995137their lives. Hiranya roared, “Take him away and teach him de-monic qualities!” This was the first time that he didn’t showanger toward Prahlada directly.But the gurus were not able to change Prahlada. After afew months, they brought him to the King again. As before,Prahlada repeated, “Om Namo Narayanaya” in answer to hisfather’s questions. Hiranya Kashyapa became furious andthrew Prahlada aside.Hiranya Kashyapa was the greatest scientist. He hadexplored Nature, seasons and the solar system. He once noticedthat the Earth’s axis was tilted at 23.5 degrees. With his yogicpowers, he changed the tilt out of curiosity. He returned it tonormal when large-scale destruction resulted. With his willpower, he had control over the orbits of the Sun and the Moonas well. That is why he thought of himself as Divine.He thought, “School is not doing any good to my son. Ishall teach him.” He said, “Son, no Narayana or any otherimaginary being has my powers. The five elements are undermy control, as are the orbits of the Sun and the Moon. I am theundisputed Master.”Prahlada burst out laughing, “Father, you have con-quered everything, but not your senses! One who bows to in-ner enemies can never subdue external ones. First of all, reduceyour ego and cultivate Love for God. Then your kingdom willgrow, and you will prosper.”138Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Flying into a rage, Hiranya caught Prahlada by his neckand held him down. “You are teaching ME?” he roared. Despitethe best efforts of gurus, no one could change Prahlada. Teach-ings learnt later in life or from others’ experiences can bechanged. But the Lord’s Name was imprinted in Prahlada’sheart at a tender age—it was impossible to erase it. Realizingthat such a boy would pose danger to his authority in the fu-ture, Hiranya decided to kill his own son!Prahlada’s travailsHiranya Kashyapa summoned his men and had themstab Prahlada with their swords. But Prahlada was unshakenby this torture. “What is this body worth, composed of thefive elements? You are punishing only my body. I’m not re-lated to it. It is only a garment, to which I have no attachment.Father! You have body-consciousness, which is the root causeof ‘I’ and ‘mine.’ You trust the perishable body to be perma-nent and forget the eternal Atma.” Leelavati could not watchthe atrocities. She fell at her husband’s feet and prayed for himto stop. Not able to assuage her grief, Hiranya Kashyapa in-structed his men to take Prahlada away and kill him elsewhere.Even the demons did not have the heart to harm the in-nocent child. But the King’s command had to be followed. Theboy was taken outside and tied to the ground. Elephants weremade to walk over him. Why would one without attachment tohis body experience any pain? Moreover, Prahlada believed inNarayana and hence, there was no question of suffering forhim. He remained unharmed.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995139Then poisonous serpents were brought and let loose onhim. The only words he uttered incessantly were, Om NamoNarayanaya. Nothing happened to him. They threw him off acliff, in vain. The demons, along with Chanda and Amarka, re-turned to the king and reported the miraculous events. “OKing! When we attack your son, he only called on Narayana.He has no trace of fear, anger or hatred. With a charming smile,he repeats, Om Namo Narayanaya. His face shows no pain orsorrow. There is some unknown Power protecting him. Toharm Prahlada is a task beyond us.”Hiranya Kashyapa now doubted if the demons werecarrying out his orders or lying to him. He decided that the boybe put to death in front of his eyes! He had a bowl of deadlypoison brought, called Prahlada near and instructed him todrink it. Smiling all the while and chanting Om Namo Nara-yanaya, Prahlada calmly quaffed it. Hiranya Kashyapa glared athim, expecting him to collapse. All the demons watched withbated breath. But Prahlada didn’t die. Hiranya thought,“Chanda and Amarka were right. Maybe there is some spirit orghost in Prahlada. It cannot be Divine power because only mypower is Divine”! Then he called for experts in mantras andother sciences to rid Prahlada of the “evil spirit”. Nothingseemed to work. Frustrated and dispirited, Hiranya Kashyapaaddressed Prahlada, “You say ‘Narayana, Narayana’ all thetime. Where is this Narayana?”Prahlada advises his fatherToday’s scientists, after many experiments, proclaimthat the atom is the basic element in creation. The atom is thebasis for the cosmos. It is present everywhere in the Universe.140Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995It took scientists over a thousand years to discover and under-stand this concept. But Prahlada discovered this principle longbefore them. He said that God is present everywhere, as scien-tists talk about the atom. “Do not fall into doubt that He ishere but not there. Wherever you look, you will find Him,” hesaid. Hiranya Kashyapa said, “Really? Is God present every-where? Fine, show Him to me.”Prahlada replied, “Father! Steeped in slavery to thesenses and in body-consciousness, you want to see God. It isimpossible. You struggle hard to earn fame and worldly secu-rity but you do not yearn for God. God grants whatever youwant. You desire that your power and fame increase. You liveunder the dominance of ego and attachment. As long as thefeelings of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ prevail, it is impossible for you tograsp the Atma principle.”Even today, men search for God while identifying withthe body and reinforcing their feelings of “I” and “Mine”. Theywill not find God, no matter how long they try. The principleof the non-dual Atma must first be understood. You must offeryourself to God! Meaning what? All actions must be per-formed with divine feelings. In the food he ate, the water hedrank, and the difficulties he underwent, in everything, Prah-lada saw only Narayana, Narayana, Narayana. This divineprinciple is unchanging. If you put sugar in coffee, in tea, inwater, in anything, it lends sweetness. In the same way, Prah-lada introduced the sweetness of Narayana into all his actions.Sweeter than sugar,Tastier than curd,Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995141More relishing than honey,Exuding nectarine taste upon repetition,Such is the Name of the Lord.“Father! You are mistaking sugar for nectar. But really,even nectar is tasteless when compared to the sweetness ofGod’s Name. This sweetness is not present in anything else.Instead of repeating such a sweet Name, you spend life feedingyour ego. You are committing crimes against society based onthe strength of Brahma’s boons. Your ego will ruin you com-pletely. You need humility to attain God. Father! Educationwithout character, worship without sacrifice, wealth withouteffort, politics without principles —these sins are the basis forall the misery in the world.”What are the sins of society? Education without charac-ter is one. Wealth without effort is another. We must make ef-fort! Without effort how can you expect anything in return?Next, worship without sacrifice. Yes, you are all praying. Butit is prayer without sacrifice. Sacrifice alone grants bliss inworship. Politics without principles and science without hu-man values are on the increase. If science had principles, howwould bombs and other means of unrest come about? Humanvalues have become zero in science.“Father, you are a great scientist, but without humanvalues. Your demonic tendencies show no signs of abating.First, bring your senses under control. Without control overyour senses you can never perceive the omnipresent Lord.”Prahlada advised his father in many ways. But no matter howbright a bulb is held in front of a blind man, he cannot see thebrightness. Prahlada continued, “You do not have the eyes of142Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995divine love. You are blind in wisdom. How do you expect tosee God? Your body is filled with the six enemies: lust, anger,greed, hatred, jealousy and pride.”As is the color of the eyeglasses, so is the vision. Prah-lada said, “When your heart is full of anger, lust, jealousy, at-tachment and ego, how do you expect to see God? Wherever Ilook I see Narayana. Inside, outside, above, below... He is pre-sent everywhere!“Father! The whole world is like an iron ball beingburnt in fire. Where does this fire reside? The heat is within theball, outside it, everywhere. Antar Bahisya Sarvavyaapya Na-rayanah Sthitah—Narayana is present inside, outside, every-where. This world is similarly engulfed in the fire of jnana. Fa-ther, heat is experienced only by touching. Unless you experi-ence something, you cannot understand it. Your ignorance isthe root cause of all this confusion. Listen to my words. God ispresent wherever you look.”But this foolish man didn’t leave his stubborn stand.“Is God really present everywhere? Is He present in this pil-lar?” he asked, pointing to a pillar. “Yes,” said Prahlada. “But Icannot see Him. I’m going to destroy this pillar!” thunderedHiranya. He took a heavy mace and smashed the pillar withforce. The pillar broke into two pieces.Narasimha AvatarOut emerged a most terrifying form: Narasimha (Man-Lion) Avatar. It wasn’t human, it wasn’t animal. The head wasa lion’s but the body, human. Hiranya immediately recalledSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995143Brahma’s boon—“neither by man or by animal.” He told him-self that his death seemed imminent. After fighting with him forsome time, Narasimha pulled Hiranya Kashyapa by his handand laid him across His thighs.Hiranya recalled, “I wanted to be killed neither on earthnor in the sky. Now I am on the thighs of this being, above theground and below the sky. I asked for immunity against theliving and the non-living. The nails on this being’s claws areneither living nor non-living. It is the hour of twilight, neitherday nor night.” Hiranya did not have the sense to remember thename of Narayana in his last moments. He only kept remem-bering Brahma’s boon and how all the conditions had been sat-isfied. The tendencies cultivated through our lifetime predomi-nate during our final moments and form the basis for our nextbirth. Not having repeated Narayana’s name during his lifetime,Hiranya Kashyapa wasn’t able to do it at death. NarasimhaAvatar completed His task.Prahlada with the LordAll were terrified by Narasimha’s ferocious form. Theyshivered with fright. Prahlada alone gazed at Him with un-blinking eyes, full of tears of joy. Narasimha asked him, “Child,doesn’t My form frighten you?” Prahlada said, “Lord Nara-yana, Yat Bhaavam Thath Bhavati—As is one’s thought, so isYour Form. Those who think of You as terrible see you assuch. To me, You are the very form of Love and Bliss. Whyshould I be afraid? All forms are Yours. I am not looking at thisparticular name and form. I am looking at Your Divine Formand repeating your Divine Name. So I have no fear.”144Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Hiranya Kashyapa’s body was laid on the floor. Prah-lada went close to the body and paid his respects. “For birthand death our own actions are responsible, not God. Each per-son reaps his own happiness and sorrow. My father broughtthis death upon himself. This is not God’s doing,” thoughtPrahlada. No one can escape the consequences of one’s actions.You cannot tell what you might experience and when. So beever ready. No one is exempt from this vigilance. Even Hi-ranya's invincibility was won because of past good deeds. Buthe could not enjoy God’s boons because of his wicked actions.In the end, he was destroyed by the destiny he had carved forhimself. Prahlada prayed for a good afterlife for his father.After Prahlada’s prayer many gods began arriving thereand discussing the events. Before terminating His Avatar asNarasimha, the Lord asked Prahlada what he wanted. Prahladasaid, “O Lord, I want nothing but You. I should never be dis-tant from You, although You are everywhere. I must live inYou, You must live in me, and I must experience this unity. Ido not have any other desires. It is meaningless if I waste thislife by desiring petty things.” Then the Lord appeared in Hisfull glory as Narayana and said, “Prahlada, My child! Childrenlike you are examples to this world. Now take charge of yourfather’s kingdom. Teach human values to these demons andensure that they come closer to Me.”The distinction between a human and a demon arisesonly from qualities. Demons do not have any peculiar physicaltraits as portrayed in cinemas and books. They are humansalso. It is only by qualities that a human becomes a demon. Inthe Bhagavatham there is a nice example. Krishna was GodSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995145Himself. His parents, Devaki and Vasudeva, were true humans.And Devaki’s brother, Kamsa, was a demon. Thus, all threecategories—divine, human and demon—can exist even withinthe same family! Kamsa was a demon because of his anger andcruelty. Devaki and Vasudeva were humans for their kindnessand compassion. Possessing Divine traits, which are beyond allattributes, Krishna was God.The Lord told Prahlada, “I’m keeping you here so thatyou transform these demons into humans and enable them torecognize Divinity.” Prahlada said, “Lord, please don’t give methis responsibility. I want only You, nothing else. All thesetasks are Yours.” He fell at the Lord’s feet and pleaded repeat-edly. But we must act as per the time, place and situation inwhich God places us. It is impossible for anyone to disobeyGod.The Lord called Prahlada near and took him on His lap.Holding him close, He said, “Child! Do you want more thanTHIS? This is the highest blessing—There is nothing greaterthan seeing Me, touching Me, talking to Me. These are themeans to liberation. Think of these moments ceaselessly andrule the world. Follow the divine command,” instructed theLord as He disappeared.The Lord departed quickly, lest Prahlada ask more de-sires! No one has the “knack” that God has! He acts in a veryguarded and cautious manner. He takes the middle path—Hedoesn’t hurt anyone nor inconvenience Himself! If the Lordremained there longer, Prahlada might have asked Him some-thing else. Without giving that chance, the Lord disappeared146Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995promptly! Prahlada ruled the kingdom, all the while chantingOm Namo Narayanaya.Everything is divine WillIn this manner the son was a highly purified soul eventhough the father was a demon. Although born to a demonicfather, Prahlada had an element of Divinity. But what about hischildren? Prahlada’s children inherited his father’s qualities.Prahlada’s son, Virochana, was a hater of God, like HiranyaKashyapa. Recognize these connections between father andson. These relations are based not on chance, but on qualities.This is Divine Will. Everything is Divine Will.Good, bad, everything is God’s Will. We should notdifferentiate between good and bad. People believe that goodevents are God’s Will and unfortunate ones are not. In thisworld no one eats only sweet food or only bitter food. Every-one eats both sweet and bitter food. In other words, everyoneexperiences both good and bad. If we inquire, bitter experiencesare necessary! Only then can we appreciate the value of peace,contentment and bliss. Difficulties and joy go together. No onecan separate them. Happiness doesn’t exist alone anywhere.Happiness results when difficulties are transcended.A baby gradually becomes a grandparent. But the twoare not different. Similarly, the good in us can turn bad and thebad can become good. We should experience the unity of both.That which makes us understand this unity is our Divinity.When we distance ourselves from Divinity, we deteriorate todemonic and animal states.Attachment causes animal qualitiesSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995147To keep demonic and animal tendencies at bay we mustlimit attachment and pride. More attachment means more ani-mal qualities. What is animal nature? The loss of discrimina-tion. Even mistakes are perceived as good deeds when one isblinded by attachment. This was the case with Dhritharashtra.He knew that Duryodhana’s actions were sins. But his fatherlyattachment repeatedly forgave those sins. As a result, his entirefamily perished.No doubt, attachment is necessary, but only withinlimits. Yes, you may have attachment in certain relations. Youmay look after your wife and children with care. But while en-gaged in such duties, the easiest path is to perceive everythingas belonging to God. All your actions must be done with thisfeeling of Divinity. Then your actions will become pleasing toGod and earn His love.The Divine NameProceeding on the Divine path in this manner, becomelike Prahlada and strive for the welfare of your family, country,and the whole world. Even if you do not have Prahlada’s idealqualities, at least never forget God’s Name. Whatever difficul-ties you may encounter, remember God’s name ceaselessly. Nomatter how foolish or demonic a person, it is easy to bring theLord’s name to one’s lips during difficulties.When you see something strange or fearful, you ex-claim, “O My God!” This is a reflex action, done without pre-meditation. You don’t say “God” but “My God”. This spiri-tual feeling is present even in a foolish or wicked person. He148Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995may appear to be an atheist, but still he refers to God as “MyGod”! He admits the truth!So follow the natural discipline of chanting the Lord’sName. No matter what difficulties you encounter, even if ridi-culed, never forget God’s Name. Prahlada respected his fatherbut disputed with him about the Truth when necessary. Youmay also explain your faith to your parents, but never yield topressure from anyone and change your attitude. Faith in God isour life-breath. The Bhagavatham lays special emphasis on theconstant remembrance of the Name of the Lord.[Swami sang “Hari Bhajana Bina Sukha Shanti Nahi”.]

Dharma, artha, kama and moksha are the four purusharthas (goals ) ofhuman life.2.

A healthy body promoteshealthy thoughts. An unsound mind cannot entertain sacredand elevating thoughts. Thus ancient people considered healthas wealth and paid attention to the upkeep of the body. Evenin the modern age, people have evolved various systems to en-sure good health. The Romans and Greeks saw the body as arepresentation of the cosmos and worshipped it.The body and the IndwellerThe organs of the body cannot work or even exist, in-dependently. Their unity alone allows the body to be completeand to perform useful functions. When we understand thisunity, we can know the Indweller of the body. The Vedas say,Deho Devaalayam Jeevo Devo Sanaatanah—The body is atemple and the Indweller is the Eternal God. Ancient Indiansrecognized this truth and demonstrated it in their day-to-daylives. But the youth of today are preoccupied with the bodyand neglect the Indweller. Water does not need fish, but fish150Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995need water. In the same way, the body cannot survive withoutthe Indweller.The body is a chariot. We must maintain it well and useit to tread the right path. Today man concerns himself onlywith decorating and painting this chariot. People do not makeefforts to recognize the wonderful Charioteer. Keep the in-dwelling Divinity in view and engage the body in righteous ac-tions.The forest fireAs per their daily routine, Balarama and Krishna wentto the forest with the gopalas1 and cows. After walking somedistance, Krishna played His flute and the boys started singing,dancing and playing in the fields. The gopalas enjoyed them-selves immensely in Krishna’s company every day, forgettingtheir bodies, losing themselves in the melodious notes of Hisflute. This day they were so engrossed in His music that theyforgot the cows and calves. When they came to their senses,the animals were nowhere to be seen.Each gopala ran in a different direction. All the sur-roundings were searched but the cows were not found. Inpanic, they ran deep into the forest. Finally they saw the cowsgrazing at a distance, surrounded by a huge forest fire. Smokebellowed out of everywhere and nothing was visible clearly.The gopalas shouted, “Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!” Balaramaand Krishna ran there. By then the fire had engulfed them all.The gopalas were afraid for their lives. They couldn’t tell whatmight happen the very next moment. Krishna called out to thecows by their names, one by one. The cows heard His voiceSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995151and responded, “Ambaa, Ambaa.” These cows had recognizedSabda Brahman.2 The cows had no knowledge or education.But identifying Krishna’s voice as the sound of Divinity, theybolted in His direction.The gopalas were troubled by the fear of death.Krishna and Balarama went to them and said, “Do not fear.Why fear when we are here? You have walked long distances insearch of the cows. You left familiar territory behind and ven-tured into the dense forest. You are tired. Close your eyes. Donot open them till we tell you.” The fire was very near themand the gopalas could feel the hot draft. But placing completefaith in Krishna, they closed their eyes. This was not new togopalas. Their greatest virtue was to obey Krishna always.Not even once did the gopalas ever question or disobeyKrishna. If Krishna said “do,” they did. If He said “go,” theywent. No questions, no hesitation. That is why they lived inKrishna’s permanent protection.After a few moments Krishna asked them to open theireyes. The gopalas felt a cool, refreshing breeze. “Where did thefire go?” they wondered. They saw their cows around them,safe and sound. They were back in the fields where they werelast playing, singing and dancing. They thought deeply aboutthis undeniable miracle. Unable to fathom the mystery, theysaid to Krishna, “O Lord Narayana! Beginning-less and EndlessOne! Protector of the helpless! You are the Supreme Lord. Weare fortunate to experience Your leelas and wondrous powers.”Saying so, they fell at Krishna’s Feet.152Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995But for how long? Only for a few minutes. Then theyforgot the miracles. They asked their “dear friend” to join themin games! They stopped addressing Him as “Lord”. Notice,how bodily attachment is ready to spring on us every moment.When people see miracles, they think, “He is powerful.” Thenext minute, yielding to body attachment, they say, “He is anordinary man.” In every Avatar’s life, people alternate betweenhuman and divine perceptions of Him. Why? Men spend theirlives in body-consciousness. Their goal is worldly life and theyare incapable of understanding the Divinity that transcendstheir mundane existence. The gopalas also used to appreciateKrishna’s strength and intellect, but not His Divinity.Krishna teaches Atma VidyaAs they passed days in this manner, Krishna decided toteach Atma Vidya to the gopalas. “Their thoughts are limited tothe world. They are not able to recognize Me as beyond thebody, mind and intellect,” thought Krishna. The rainy seasonhas just began. The blue sky was dark, laden with clouds. Insome time, thunder and lightning began. Krishna looked at thisscene and said, “You can see the unity of three gunas in Naturetoday. O Gopalas! God is omnipresent like the infinite, bluesky. This Divinity (sky) is covered by the dark clouds of yourignorance (Thamo Guna). Thunder (Rajo Guna) and the bril-liant lightning (Sathwa Guna) accompany this ignorance. Thisis the inner meaning of the rainy season. You cannot perceiveDivinity since it is concealed by these three gunas. The windswhich brought the dark clouds will also scatter them in duetime. Similarly, when your ignorance (ajnana) turns into wis-dom (prajnana), your darkness will be dispelled.”Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995153As lightning lies behind the screen of dark clouds,Wisdom (jnaana) must underlie education.“Therefore, recognize the meanings of natural phenom-ena. Nature is your best teacher. As you observe Nature, real-ize that your body is also a part of it. Your vision is limited tothe physical body but not the Divinity dwelling in it. The bodyis only the effect. Atma is the cause. Don’t be blinded by theeffect. See the cause.”You look at this tumbler, the effect. But you don’t in-quire into its material, the cause. How can the tumbler existwithout silver? The world is the effect and God is the cause.“As is your sight, as is your aim, so the world will ap-pear to you. Creation (srishti) is based on your vision (drishti).None can change creation. That is why I ask you to changeyour vision. Meaning, as long as you consider yourself to bethe body, you cannot perceive My reality. You call me‘Gopala, Gopala’ and experience Me as your dear friend. Butthe body is only an instrument. Understand the Divinitywithin the body.” The gopalas went back and shared their mi-raculous experiences and Krishna’s words of wisdom with eve-ryone. In this manner, they experienced boundless bliss inKrishna’s company daily.The priests and their wivesOne day the boys went very deep into the forest,searching for fresh, green pastures for their cows. At midday,they weren’t able to walk any more. The gopalas cried, “We’rehungry, Krishna, really hungry! Please arrange for some food.”154Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Krishna smiled, “Foolish boys! When you have the All-Powerful Lord following your every step, why are you worriedabout hunger? Balarama and I are with you, don’t fear. Somepriests are performing a Yaga  nearby. Go there and tell them Isent you. Tell them you are hungry and they will feed you.”The gopalas went to the priests and pleaded for food.The brahmins said, “How can we feed you before completionof the yaga? After the yaga, we will eat. Then we will feed allthose who helped us in the ceremony. Only then, we can giveyou the leftovers. You must wait till then.” The gopalas waitedfor a long time and couldn’t bear their hunger any more. Theygrew weak and couldn’t walk. Dragging themselves, theysomehow returned to Balarama and Krishna. They said,“Krishna! We told them that even You and Balarama were hun-gry, but they ignored us.”Krishna laughed and asked them, “Friends, who did youask?” They replied, “We asked the priests.” Krishna said, “Oinnocent ones! It is the mother who knows the hunger of herchild, not the father. There is no use pleading with the priests.They are busy in karma yoga,3 without bhakti yoga.4 Theyonly care about mantras and their meanings. They overlookGod who is the embodiment of all mantras. Go to the wives ofthese brahmins, who are cooking food for the yaga right now.”The gopalas said, “Impossible, Krishna! We have noenergy to walk even a step.” Krishna replied, “You must goback. Get up, and I will give you the strength to walk.” Thegopalas never disobeyed Krishna in anything, anyway. If Hesaid “walk,” they walked. Owing to such total submission,Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995155they never experienced sorrow in their lives and obtained thebliss of Krishna’s daily company.The gopalas went to the wives of the priests. Thesepure ladies had heard much of Balarama and Krishna, but hadnever seen the brothers.The brahmins used to ridicule Krishna as a “cowherd”and never allowed their wives to visit Brindavan. The priestswere limited to rituals, but their wives had great devotion. Thegopalas said, “Mothers! We are gopalas, sent by Rama andKrishna.”The ladies were ecstatic, “The Lord Himself is here!Where are the divine Balarama and Krishna?” The gopalas said,“They are at some distance from here. They are tired and hun-gry, like us. They told us to ask you for food.” As soon asthey heard this, the ladies collected all their pots and filledthem with food. They carried some vessels and handed some tothe gopalas, and hurried toward the pastures. They didn’tthink of the yaga or their husbands’ anger... nothing!They came to Balarama and Krishna. They saw Him re-clining and playing on the flute. The notes of the flute waftedinto their hearts and awakened devotion. They forgot them-selves and walked forward unmindful of their bodies. As theydrank the divine darshan of Balarama and Krishna, their mindsoverflowed with bliss. The only word they uttered was“Krishna, Krishna, Krishna.” They made everyone sit downand served food. Even the cows were served!156Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Meanwhile the priests completed the yaga and noticedthe absence of their wives—and the food! The priests werehungry also. They ran in search of their wives. They cameupon the gopalas eating food along with Balarama and Krishna.And they saw their own wives gazing at Balarama and Krishnawith unblinking eyes. The brahmins rushed there and startedslapping and pulling at their wives. But the ladies were oblivi-ous to their husbands. They did not feel any physical pain.They were totally immersed in the Bliss of the Lord’s com-pany.Soon Balarama and Krishna let their divine effulgenceshine on the priests also. The priests recognized the brothers’Reality and fell at their feet: “For whose Grace we initiated thisyagna, the goal of this yagna, that Divine Lord is in front of usin human form! Yagnovaih Vishnuh—You are the Vishnu whois the fruit of all yagnas. But we are indeed the greatest sinners.We performed this yagna for You but we were not able todedicate it to You.”Every action must first be offered to God. Therefore, wechant Brahmaarpanam Brahmahavir Brahmaagnau Brah-manaahutam5 before meals.“Even during normal meals, we offer food to You. Buttoday, in a sacred yagna, we attempted to eat after refusingYou! We are the most abject sinners, the most unfortunatepeople. Krishna and Balarama consoled the brahmins andblessed them and their wives profusely. Then, while the gopa-las stood watching, Krishna gave darshan to the brahmins andtheir wives as Lord Narayana.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995157Conquer attachmentIt is difficult for worldly people to recognize God inhuman form. Of what use are education, scholarship in Vedasor the merit of yagnas? Those who do not grasp the truth, be-have foolishly in spite of learning. We should find ways to pu-rify our minds. When does the mind become pure? When at-tachment (abhimaana) and ego (ahamkaara) are uprooted.How can we give up attachment and ego? Attachment presentsnever-ending attraction towards objects. But it is very easy torenounce! Simply think: “Everything belongs to God. Nothingis mine.” This is the way to transcend attachment.A small example. In your science courses you go to thelaboratory. After conducting experiments, both students andteachers return home. You don’t say, “I work in this lab, sothis equipment is mine.” You know that everything belongs tothe school. But no one would object if you used the equipment.The world is like a laboratory. You may use and experience.But you have no right over anything.A manager in a bank is the highest authority over mil-lions in the bank. But can he take even a single coin home? Themoney is in his control, but it belongs to others and to theGovernment.We can experience sensory objects and joys. But how?With what attitude should we acquire material objects? Realizethis one point and you become worthy of all worldly accom-plishments. You may enjoy, but without feeling “This ismine.”158Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Another example. The principal is the highest authorityin a school. He has the keys to cupboards, which have valuableequipment. He may feel, “I am in charge, all this belongs tome.” But if he is transferred to another school, all he can takewith him are the clothes he is wearing! Why? He can only usethe objects, not own them. Why not? The school really belongsto the Government.Yes, you can say, “My home, my land, my wife, mychild, my wealth, my cattle, my cars” and so on, but keep inmind: They are for use only, not for ownership. They areGod’s property. You must part with everything at death. Thatis why the Gita says: Responsibility is yours, not the right.People forget responsibilities and fight for rights. No one has aright in this world. When you do your duty, rights followautomatically. So, gradually decrease the idea of “mine.”Yes, you say “mine.” What is yours? Nothing. Whatyou perceive to be yours can change the next moment. A manheld a currency note and thought, “This is mine.” The notelaughed at him: “Yes, now I’m in your hands. But by evening Iwill have changed over ten hands! How am I yours, you mad-man?” Worldly objects change from moment to moment. Howcan you claim ownership over such temporary articles?“Everything belongs to God.” With this attitude, yes,you may experience the world. There is nothing wrong withthat. But while experiencing, you must inquire: “Everythingbelongs to God. How should the property of God be used byme?” Experience the world with your power of discrimination.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995159If you use objects as you please, you could misuse God’sproperty. Use the world to engage in constructive actions, towalk the path of Truth. God’s command (bhagavat vaakya) isthat God’s property should not be misused.Today we misuse everything, deluded by the ideas of“I” and “Mine”. Misuse and wastage causes sorrow. What isthe cause of sorrow? The idea of “mine”. God does not causeeither joy or sorrow to you, nor does anyone else. You aloneare responsible. To blame someone else for your suffering is asin. Students should promote such expansive feelings in theirhearts.The devotion of gopikasKrishna was always surrounded in Brindavan by thegopikas and the gopalas. Of these, the gopikas were slightlymad! What kind of madness? Divine madness! But people at-tribute wrong intentions to their love and distort the meaning ofthe Bhagavatham. When Krishna left Brindavan for good, Hewas five years old. Some say that Krishna and the gopikas en-gaged in amorous sports. Is it possible for such meaninglessstories to be true? The gopikas said: “O Krishna! Your flute ismost enchanting. Your words are life to us. Sing for us, talk tous!”Paata Paadu Maa Krishna!Paluku Teneloluku NatulaMaatalaadu Maa MukundaManasu Teeraga!Sing for us, our Krishna!With your words sweet as honey.160Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Talk to us, our Mukund,Till our hearts are full!Veda Saaramanta Teerchi,Nada Brahmamuganu Maarchi,Venuvandu Tirugabosi,Gaanaroopamuganu Maarchi.Paata Paadu Maa Krishna!Take the essence of the Vedas,Change it into Sabda-Brahman,Fill your flute with this sound,And convey it to our hearts as music.Sing for us, our Krishna!What Divine feelings! Is this worldly? No, no. Anan-tovai Vedah—The Vedas are infinite. The gopikas prayed:“How can we read the Vedas? We are women and illiterate, atthat. Give us the essence of the Vedas through your music.”Now, in this Summer Course, after the guest lecturers speak inthe morning, the students summarize those speeches in theevening. In the same way, the gopikas wanted a summary ofthe Vedas from Krishna!Why song and sound? God is described as: SabdaBrahma Mayi, Charaachara Mayi, Jyotir Mayi, Vaang Mayi,Nityananda Mayi, Paroatpara Mayi, Maaya Mayi, Srimayi.Therefore, Brahman is the very form of sabda (sound).The gopikas pined for Krishna for many years, for theirentire lives. Krishna knew their pain of separation, theiryearning. He sent Uddhava6 to convey His message of consola-Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995161tion to them. All the gopikas collected around Uddhava to lis-ten to Krishna’s message. “What does Krishna say? When isHe coming to give us His darshan?” they asked.Uddhava said, “Mothers! Krishna has sent a letter foryou.” Students should clearly understand the pure and divinefeelings of the gopikas. “Here is the letter sent by Krishna.One of you please read it aloud to the others,” said Uddhava.Gopikas had no education. In those days women were not sentto school. Only one of them knew a little bit of reading. Whenasked to read it, she declined. When students listen to her re-ply, they can imagine her sacred devotion.She said, “Uddhava! I cannot read that letter. Our bod-ies and minds are burning in the fire of separation. If I touchthat letter, it might catch fire. It is not proper for us to burn thewords written by God.” Another gopika said, “We have beencrying endlessly. When I set eyes on the words written by ourdear Krishna, all our agony will emerge as tears. The tears willfall on the paper and smear the words. So I cannot read it, ei-ther.”What intense devotion they had! Uddhava himself readKrishna’s letter aloud. “O gopikas! Don’t feel sad. I am in you,with you, around you all the time. I am not separate from you.I am not an outsider, I am your Hridayavaasi—Resident ofyour heart. I am your very own. My messenger Uddhava willtell you about jnana and yoga. Listen to Uddhava and practicehis teachings.”162Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995The gopikas heard Uddhava’s teachings and said, “Wedo not need your yoga. We need merger (samyoga) withKrishna! Your yoga will not quench our thirst of separation(viyoga)! We cannot absorb your words. We have only onemind, not multiple minds like clever people. Our mind followedKrishna to Mathura.” Uddhava recognized their one-pointedness.When Uddhava got ready to depart from Brindavan,each gopika came to him and gave heart-rending messages forKrishna:“All of Brindavan is parched dry! Come back and makethe flowers bloom again!“The sky of our hearts is dark, clouded by separation.Scatter these clouds and let us bask in Your company!“Our life is like a garland bereft of flowers. Come back,collect us as flowers and wear us around Your neck!”If scholars paid attention to the sanctity and depth ofgopikas’ feelings, they would not relegate them to a worldlylevel. Gopikas were actually perfected rishis. They had at-tained absolute control over the senses and purity of mind inpast births. To accuse them of bad character is nothing short ofa crime. The hearts of students are polluted by cheap movies.No, do not allow such impressions to form. The hearts of thegopikas and gopalas were immaculate. They did not desireanything worldly at all! Uddhava recognized this truth. Whenhe returned, he extolled their virtues to Krishna without end.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995163Attalu Mottukunna, Mari Bhartalu KattuluNooruchunna Norettaru Kopagincharu Etakegaru,Bheetilaboru Gopikal Pottamulandu ChittaruvulaReeti Vaarilonunde KrishnuduTheir mother-in-laws may scream, husbands maythreaten,They do not answer back, get angry, go away or be-come afraid.Like a portrait on paper,Krishna is imprinted in their hearts.Uddhava said, “Krishna, You are imprinted in the con-sciousness of the gopikas. It is not possible for anyone toseparate You from their hearts. I have not seen devotees likethem anywhere in the world. I went to teach them wisdom butinstead, they taught me devotion! Krishna, all of us are deludedby Your physical form, but it is the gopikas alone who haverealized Your Divinity.”Once upon a time, Narada went to the gopikas andgopalas and said, “How fortunate you all are! You obtainedLord Narayana, who is beyond the reach of yogis and sages.The sacred proximity that you enjoyed is unattainable evenafter countless yagnas and good deeds. You played with Himand sang with Him as friends for many years and earned HisGrace. Truly, you are blessed! You are not ordinary souls. Youare Devas—Do not forget this truth.Do not lose Sai164Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995When God assumes a human form, He does not becomelimited or lower in any sense. Do not be deluded by suchdoubts. Think about the golden opportunity at hand and makeall possible efforts to earn His Grace and Blessings. Thischance will never come again.Chikkina Sai Ni Vakkaleyaka Chakka Chesukondi,Poyina Chikkadu ee Partheesuni Paada Seva Yandi,Bhaktini Icchi Sakti Lo Munchi Mukti Jerchunandi,Eka Manasu To Nammi Sai Ni Enchi Koluvabondi,Itarula Maatalanimpuga Nammi Kompa Teeya-kandi.You have found Sai. Now bring Him near, do not ne-glect Him.Once lost, the chance to serve the Feet of the Lord ofParthi will never come again.He bestows devotion, immerses you in strength andtakes you to Liberation.With a one-pointed mind, have faith in Sai and worshipHim.Do not ruin your destiny by giving ear to others’words.You obtained this rare opportunity. Now use it well.Follow the path prescribed by God, engage in actions that aredear to God. God seeks unwavering, pure and unselfish Lovealone. In return, He will grant anything and go to any extent toplease you.But you should not love with any expectation in mind.Prayer with expectation is like a business deal. Do not praywith conditions: “Lord, I will break two coconuts for You ifSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995165You fulfill my wish!” Strive to experience at least one-thousandth of the devotion of the gopikas and gopalas.

Embodiments of love!Every being, without exception, is a storehouse ofPrema. But there is not even one who has recognized this prin-ciple of Prema! It appears as though everyone expressesPrema. Many in the world declare their love for other people,for material objects, for wealth, for sensual pleasures. But if weask, “For whose sake is this love?” There is no satisfactoryanswer.Worldly love is selfishIt appears as if the mother loves the child and the childloves the mother. It seems as though the husband and wife loveeach other. It even appears that today’s devotees love God.But for whose sake do these people cultivate love? Who isloving whom? There are no right answers forthcoming to thesequestions. Why?Everyone loves for his own sake. No one loves for an-other’s sake. The reason: selfishness. Man loves objects in hisown interest, not for the sake of those objects. He loves moneySummer Showers in Brindavan 1995167for his own enjoyment, not for money’s sake. People also loveGod for their own petty ends, not for God. Truly, if we searchthe world over, there is no person who loves God for God’ssake. There is only selfishness, selfishness, selfishness.Sva + artham = svaartham, selfishness. Sva means self.artham means “for the sake of”. That which is in one’s owninterest is svaartham. Selfish love has three states: love in thewaking state, love in the dream state, and love in the deep sleepstate. While awake, one lives in the world and loves with one’smind and senses. One is able to love only with the combinationof mind and senses. Second, the dream state. In this state,senses are forgotten and everything is created by the mindalone. Objects, people, joys and sorrows are all conceived byhis mind. He creates even himself by his mind. Next, in deepsleep, one experiences bliss by merging in oneself. If we inquirealong the path of jnana, none of these three states providesperception of the Atma.Today we undertake many spiritual practices. But weare not able to progress by even a “millimeter.” Why? Selfish-ness. Where is selfishness born? Man is the combination ofmind and senses. Without the mind and senses, humannesscannot exist. Humanness is characterized by the three gunas:sathwa, rajas, and tamas. Tamas is characterized by the rule ofthe mind and senses, which gives birth to ego and attachmentand leads to the joys and sorrows in human life. Next, experi-encing and observing the mind and senses and making everyeffort to limit attachment and ego—this is rajas. Ignoring theprompting of the mind and the senses, with no expectation ofthe fruits of one’s actions, engaging in activity with the spirit168Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995of sacrifice and duty, considering all as God’s work, doing eve-rything with the view to earning God’s Love—these are sath-wic traits.Akrura comes to BrindavanSuch a sathwic person was Akrura. Akrura had perse-vered for countless lives to achieve Divinity. He had waitedpatiently for the right time and the right place to meet God. Heknew that Narayana had incarnated in Brindavan and wasplaying there as a cowherd boy. But for every desired objec-tive, the factors of time, cause, and karma must unite. It takestime for a fruit to ripen and detach from its branch. Akrura wasa man of great wisdom and looked forward to the right momentto meet Lord Narayana.Meanwhile, Narada went to meet Balarama and Krishnain Brindavan. “Narayana, Adisesha! I’ve waited long for Yourdarshan. Vinaasa Kaale Vipareeta Buddhih—A contorted in-tellect heralds the doom of man. With a view to destroyingYou, Your maternal uncle Kamsa devised various plans. But allhis efforts have proved futile. Now his end is imminent.”This is also total selfishness. The idea of taking anotherperson’s life in order to protect one’s own life is a sign of anunripe intellect. One who lets selfishness grow within invitessuch demonic tendencies.Narada said, “Kamsa’s death is near. You are all-knowing, all-powerful. You are Narayana, which I recognizedlong ago. Still, some facts must be protected without being ex-pressed. Men are not able to recognize You. This depends onSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995169the karma and deservedness of each person. With whateverattitude people think of You, You assume that form for them.This is a truth not known to everyone. You fulfill whateverthey desire of You. As is a person’s mind, so is the result theyexperience. So Lord, give me leave now. Tomorrow, Your mag-nificent power will be known the world over. I will see Youagain during the coronation of your grandfather, Ugrasena.”With beautiful smiles, Balarama and Krishna bid Narada fare-well.The very next day, Akrura proceeded to Brindavan inhis chariot. Akrura was a great devotee. “No matter how de-monic Kamsa may be, he granted me this chance of meeting theDivine Krishna. I am grateful to Kamsa,” thought Akrura tohimself. Akrura entertained pure feelings even toward demons.He reached Brindavan at dusk. His chariot came to a halt infront of Nanda’s house. He went inside but found thatBalarama and Krishna were not home. They had gone to theforest with their cows.Balarama and Krishna returned in a few minutes. A-rura’s eyes rested on them. He was spellbound. This was hisfirst time seeing them. He was mesmerized by their brilliance,lotus eyes, and bewitching smiles. He felt an instant attractionto them. He contemplated on Narayana within himself andcouldn’t find words to greet Krishna. Krishna, the all-knowingOne, asked him many times, “Akrura, O Akrura! For what rea-son have you come?”Akrura said, “Krishna! Kamsa has initiated a yagacalled Dhanur Yaga. He has sent me to fetch You. This is the170Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995partial truth. To speak the whole truth in front of God is mybounden duty. Dhanur Yaga is an excuse for Kamsa to sum-mon You to Mathura. Kamsa plans to kill You there and ruleundisputed forever after. Each person has a different feelingtoward You.”The saint Annamacharya sang, Enta MaatramunaEvaru Talachira Anta Maatrame Neevu—Whatever form andattitude You are pictured with, You assume that form.“If people think of You as a man, You behave as a man.If they consider You divine, You appear as God. This multi-plicity is not in You but in human attitudes. Krishna, get readyto go to Mathura.” Then Akrura turned to Nanda and invitedhim also. Kamsa had invited Nanda and other village chiefs forthe Dhanur Yaga also.Some texts say that Nanda and Yasoda were fearfulabout sending Krishna to Mathura. This is not true. Nanda andYasoda had witnessed countless instances of Krishna’s Divin-ity. They had seen Krishna destroy Kamsa’s mighty demons.They were present when He danced on the hood of the serpentKaliya and subdued it. They knew that Balarama and Krishnacould never face danger. All victories wed only God, and theyknew Krishna was God.Nanda had an announcement made in Brindavan thatevening: “King Kamsa is conducting a Dhanur Yaga inMathura. Those who wish to witness the festivities may ac-company me.” Many families got ready with chariots, horsesSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995171and carts, as per their capacity. It was a joyous occasion foreveryone—everyone except the gopikas.The grief of gopikas and gopalasOf course, no one can harm Krishna, the Lord Himself.This wasn’t the concern of the gopikas. Their worry was: WillKrishna return to Brindavan once He leaves? All the gopikasand gopalas convened a meeting to prevent Krishna from leav-ing! They made a human chain circling Nanda’s house. Nanda,and Yasoda pleaded with them not to obstruct the plans, butthe gopikas and gopalas could only cry piteously in justifica-tion. “Krishna! Rama! You cannot go to Mathura! What willbecome of us? Brindavan will become a barren wasteland. Eve-ryone here will become lifeless. The green beauty of Brindavanwill be lost forever. Don’t leave!”This was also selfishness! In the interest of keepingKrishna’s company, they did not mind foiling Krishna’s plans!Balarama and Krishna smiled and told them, “We also havesome selfishness of our own! Our Will must be fulfilled. Theobjective for which we assumed human forms must be attained,O gopikas and gopalas! It is every man’s duty to fulfill thepurpose for which the body is given. We must go to Mathura.There is no other way.” The gopikas and gopalas weredrowned in sorrow. They had to admit that keeping Krishna inBrindavan was an act of selfishness on their part.The gopikas said, “We do not desire any worldly ends.We want You for our mental satisfaction. People desire variousthings from You. We pray to You for You.” Then Krishna be-gan to teach them jnana. “You say ‘my’ satisfaction. Who is172Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995this ‘I’ ? Are you the body? Or the mind? No, no. You are nei-ther the body nor the mind. The body is inert, a collection ofthe five elements. The mind is fickle. The Indweller, Atma,makes the body and mind function.A director pulls on the strings of puppets. He makesthe puppets play together for a while and then separates them.Who are these puppets? Mind and senses. The mind andsenses function together. Then the mind leaves the senses, andthe senses leave the mind. And finally, both of them leave thebody. What is that which never leaves, never perishes? TheAtma alone. That is the real ‘I’. Man is able to say ‘I’ by theprompting of the Atma, but he identifies it with the body. Thissubmerges him in ego and attachment. Therefore, the One whoexists in you is ‘I’. The One in me is ‘I’ also. Ekovasi SarvaBhoota Antar-aatma—The One God exists in all beings. So, donot feel sad. Recognize these truths about the Atma, which willreveal all secrets.In this world, results of past actions must be experi-enced. The body may collapse at any moment. But it is man’sduty to strive for well-being when disease attacks the body.Similarly, the world is plunged in disease today. Men’s badthoughts and actions are the cause. To destroy this pervasiveunrighteousness, we must go to Mathura.”Explaining to the gopikas and gopalas in this manner,Krishna and Balarama entered their house. They collected theirluggage for the journey and came out. They had packed all theirarticles the previous day. Akrura sat behind the horses, holdingthe reins of the chariot. Despite the jnana they had just heard,Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995173gopikas and gopalas could not transcend their ego and attach-ment. They blocked the path to the chariot. Akrura was theirelder and elders should not be disrespected. The gopikas andgopalas knew that. But their love for Krishna overpoweredsuch formalities.They saw Krishna and Balarama emerge from the housewith luggage. They panicked and cried loudly, “Please don’tleave! How can we live? Take us with You!” They pleaded inmany ways, even using harsh words on Akrura. Balarama andKrishna did not want to prolong their agony. They walkedslowly to the chariot, smiling, blessing and consoling all thetime. This incident caused a few hours of delay. They couldnot reach Mathura at the intended time.Akrura experiences Krishna’s omnipresenceBy dusk they reached the banks of River Yamuna. Ak-rura had to perform Sandhya Vandanam.1 He instructedBalarama and Krishna to wait in the chariot and went to theriver. While praying, when Akrura dipped his head into the wa-ter, he saw a vision of Lord Narayana reclining on Adisesha. Heperceived the forms of Krishna and Balarama as Narayana andAdisesha. He was confused and lifted his head out of the water.Krishna and Balarama were in the chariot, conversing animat-edly. Akrura told himself, “What a fool I am! How can I limitthe Lord? Is He not everywhere?” This was the Grace earnedby him. Until the devotee reaches a lofty state, he cannot ap-preciate God’s omnipresence.Akrura silently returned to the chariot and took hisplace. Krishna asked him most unassumingly, “Akrura, your174Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995face is so radiant! What happened? Did you see or experienceanything extraordinary? Tell us!” Akrura said, “Krishna, MyLord, don’t You know? I saw You.” Krishna casually re-sponded, “I see, you have recognized Me at least now,” andinstructed that the chariot proceed to Mathura.On the streets of MathuraThey reached Mathura at night. Balarama and Krishnatold Akrura, “Tomorrow is the Dhanur Yaga. So we will notcome to your house tonight.” Akrura pleaded, “Where else willyou spend the night, Swami? Please be gracious enough to ac-cept my invitation.” Krishna said, “It is not right for us tocome now. You are the messenger of Kamsa today. It is notproper for Me to accept the hospitality of a messenger. This iscontrary to the guidelines of diplomacy.”By that time, all the Brindavan people had gathered inMathura with Krishna and Balarama. They wanted to visit thepoor couple, Devaki and Vasudeva, who were still in jail.Krishna and Balarama could have gone to see them. But theydid not. They had to set an example to the world and teach theideal: Maatru Devo Bhava, Pitru Devo Bhava—Mother andfather are equal to God. This is God’s primary teaching in allages. People might wonder: Why did Krishna not go to see Hisparents soon after arriving in Mathura? No. Balarama andKrishna had resolved to kill Kamsa and only then see their par-ents—not just see them, but free them from prison. Krishnaspent the night in the same house where Nanda and otherscamped.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995175At dawn, Krishna and Balarama roamed aroundMathura. They looked like lion cubs—beautiful and majestic.The entire city came to know of their presence in a matter ofmoments. As the two brothers walked the streets of Mathura,men, women and children drank their darshan from rooftops,windows—everywhere. Everybody thought, “Our lives areredeemed. What more can we ask for? Since long we desired tobehold Balarama and Krishna. We are indebted to Kamsa.”Krishna and Balarama did not even go home till evening.The washerman and the perfume womanKrishna and Balarama reached the main gate of Kamsa’spalace. The yaga was to begin the following day. A washermanwas about to enter the gate. He had a load of Kamsa’s bestsilks, cleaned specially for the function. Balarama asked him,“Hey, what is that bundle you have?” Krishna said, “Why ask?Go see for yourself.” The washerman said, “These are theKing’s costly silks. You seem to be villagers. You are not fit toeven touch these clothes! Be gone!” Krishna heard this andgave a tight-fisted blow to the washerman. Both the washermanand his bundle fell down. Krishna opened the bundle and col-lected clothes for Himself and for His elder brother. The sol-diers at the gate witnessed this scene and informed Kamsa.Meanwhile, as Balarama and Krishna were about toproceed after adorning themselves in these silks, a lady ap-proached the gate. Her name was Kubja. Her face was beautifulbut her body was crooked in three places. She was carryingperfumes and pastes. She raised her head and saw the brothers.She thought, “Are these the sons of Devaki and Vasudeva?They appear to be Avatars of Lord Narayana. Truly, that de-176Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995mon Kamsa is not worthy of my perfumes. How nice it wouldbe if these children accepted them!”With a full heart, she humbly went to Krishna, “Son,here are my perfumes and rose water, prepared with care. Noone knows the secrets of these preparations besides me. Thereare many people selling perfumes in Mathura but the King ac-cepts only mine. Please accept these perfumes.” Krishnadipped His hand into her boxes and dabbed His clothes hereand there, only for Kubja’s satisfaction. Kubja said, “For hav-ing lived this long, for having taken up this profession, my lifeis redeemed today. All these years I offered my perfumes tothe demon Kamsa. Today I served the Lord.” Shedding copioustears, Kubja expressed gratitude to them. Then she steppedaside with the intention of going her way. Krishna stopped her.“You have granted us these perfumes. In return, I am bound togive you something. I never take anything from anyone withoutreason. But whatever I take, I return a thousand-fold.”Offer something to GodGod never asks anything from anyone. But when peo-ple give to Him with a full heart, He returns a thousand-fold.You know the story of Kuchela. For the gift of a fistful of dryrice, Krishna granted him lifelong prosperity.2 Rukmini Deviwas able to win Krishna for herself by offering Him just a sin-gle tulasi leaf.3 So, whenever God accepts anything from any-one, He grants unending bounty in return.That is why it is said, Patram Pushpam Phalam To-yam4—a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or some water. At least thesemust be offered to God. Why? Only when we offer, we be-Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995177come eligible to receive. If you go to a bank and simply ask foryour money, they will not give it to you although you haveevery right over it. You need to fill a withdrawal slip and signit. Only then can you claim your money. So, you must givesomething first, in order to receive. This is Divine Law. Even ifit is tiny or insignificant, it must be offered to God.So Krishna said, “O Kubja! Wait, wait. For your per-fumes gifted to us with a pure heart, I must return the favor.”Krishna went close to her and she could not fathom His inten-tions. Krishna pressed Kubja’s feet with His tiny Feet. He putHis hand under her chin and lifted her. The bends in her bodybecame straight! Kubja thought, “He has granted me a beautifulbody in keeping with my beautiful face. He is Lord Narayana!”She offered all her perfumes to Krishna and said, “Lord, pleasecome to my house and let me serve Your Lotus Feet.” Krishnagave His word, “After I fulfill My task in Mathura, I shall cer-tainly visit your house.”The end of KamsaThe next day, these two lions strode along the streets.As they approached the Dhanur Yaga, the grandeur of thecosmos seemed to be reflected in their faces. Whoever set theireyes on them could not stop looking at them. People forgotthemselves, gazing at the beautiful forms of Krishna andBalarama.Balarama and Krishna reached the main gate. A madelephant was stationed there, specially to stop them. Allwatched with bated breath. They were anxious that the ele-178Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995phant might trample upon the boys any moment. Trumpetingferociously, the elephant charged at Balarama and Krishna. Itlifted its huge feet off the ground and attempted to crush them.Krishna and Balarama were tiny, only five years old! They ranbetween the elephant’s legs and confused it. Then Balaramacaught one leg and Krishna, another. They whirled the elephantaround and dashed it against the ground, much like a washer-man beats clothes on a rock. The elephant gave up its life.Kamsa was informed that his most ferocious elephant hadfailed to stop Krishna. His fear increased from moment to mo-ment.As Krishna and Balarama proceeded into the grounds,two men accosted them. They were Chanura and Mushtika,Kamsa’s prize wrestlers, under orders to do away with the twoboys. Krishna and Balarama looked at them and said, “AreYOU going to fight us? O foolish men, you are like mosquitoesdesiring combat with an elephant! Mosquitoes!” Chanura andMushtika could not bear this insult. They jumped upon thetiny boys in fury. Krishna and Balarama gave them just oneblow with their fists and the wrestlers were rendered lifeless.However, they recognized the brothers as divine and had LordNarayana’s darshan just before they died.Krishna and Rama proceeded forward. The DhanurYaga was in progress. Many kings, chiefs, and citizens hadgathered to witness it. Kamsa was seated on a vast, raised plat-form built especially for him. Balarama and Krishna walked tothe center of the grounds fearlessly, with the gait of lions.Kamsa appeared strong outwardly but his heart became weakeras Krishna got closer. Kamsa’s body began shivering andSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995179shaking. Many people thought, “Look at the King! He is soangry that his body shakes in fury!” In reality, Kamsa’s bodywas shaking not out of anger but out of fear! Yat Bhavam ThathBhavati—as is the feeling, so is the result. Kamsa’s wickednessalone made him experience fear now. This is also called “guiltyconscience”.Kamsa’s entire army was arrayed around him to guardhim against Krishna’s approach. But Balarama and Krishna ig-nored Kamsa. They walked straight towards the Dhanus—theDivine Bow—kept at the center of the enclosure. No one couldbudge the Bow, what to talk of lifting it. Krishna casually heldit with his left hand and lifted it as if it was a feather. As Hebent the bow to tie its string, the bow snapped in His arms.The sound was deafening, like a bomb. All were terrified.At that time, Nanda was approaching Kamsa to paytaxes collected from Brindavan. Other village chiefs were doingthe same. Nanda’s eyes followed Krishna’s every action. Helooked forward to more of His exploits. He was not worriedbecause he knew that the brothers were divine. The divineBow, the focus of the yaga, was broken. Kamsa rose from histhrone, and the whole assembly rose with him. Kamsa orderedhis army to destroy Krishna and Balarama.Kamsa was heavily built. Krishna and Balarama weretiny and agile. Like baby deer, they ran between the legs of theintervening soldiers! Reaching the dais, both of them jumpedupon Kamsa. They caught hold of Kamsa’s hair, pulled him tothe ground and put an end to him. It was all over in moments.Everyone was stunned speechless. Of course, the heavenly180Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995prophecy was bound to come true. They recognized Krishna asNarayana and bowed down with folded hands.The reunion with parentsWithout wasting any time, Krishna and Balarama hur-ried to Kamsa’s dungeons. They fell at the feet of Devaki andVasudeva. They freed them from shackles and brought themout into the open. Then they went to the cell where Ugrasenahad been imprisoned by Kamsa. They freed him also andbrought him to the yaga hall. With his son’s dead body lyingthere, Ugrasena was crowned as King of Mathura.After the coronation, Yasoda, Nanda, Devaki,Vasudeva, and Rohini—all hugged Balarama and Krishna. Allthree mothers were there. All of Brindavan was there, exceptthe gopikas. There was no limit to their happiness and excite-ment. Devaki took Krishna and Balarama into the palace andsaid, “Sons, I could not witness Your childhood, but only hearof Your exploits and pranks from others. How unfortunate Iam! I could not see You kill the demoness Putana. When Ya-soda wanted to tie You to a rock, no length of rope was enoughto go around Your stomach—so I have heard. I gave You birth,but all the fun and frolic with You belonged to Yasoda. You arecalled ‘son of Yasoda’. How blessed she is! Though I havechildren, I am as good as childless.”Balarama and Krishna consoled their parents andgranted them unlimited happiness through loving words. “Pastis past. Do not grieve. From now, we are always with you.You will experience all possible bliss in our company. YouSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995181know we are not ordinary boys. We will bring the whole worldwithin our control. I gave you darshan soon after Mybirth—Preserve that vision in your heart. Visualize it outsideyou also. Antar Bahischa Thath Sarva Vyaapya NarayanaSthitah—God is inside, outside, everywhere. Decrease yourattachment to the body. Strengthen your bond to the Atma. At-tachment is the root cause of sorrow. You suffered in prisonbecause you were attached to your sons. Understand that weare not ordinary, that we are God. Recognize the reality ofyour sons.” In this manner, Krishna and Balarama consoledtheir mother tenderly and taught her the Truth.Akrura’s devotionAfter Kamsa’s death, Krishna went to Akrura’s house.He had given His word. The Lord never goes back on Hispromise. Akrura told Krishna, “Swami! I doubted if You hadpity on me. You killed Kamsa without any leniency, althoughhe was Your uncle. You have no trace of attachment. We areattached to You, but You are attached to no one. All are equalto You, all are Your relatives. I have recognized this truth aboutYou today.You killed Tataki,5 although she was a woman. Youasked King Bali6 for alms. He surrendered everything to You.And look what You did. You pressed him into the netherworlds with Your Feet! My mind was confused. How couldsuch a strict Lord ever feel kindness and pity toward me? Afterall, who am I?”In this manner, Akrura ran to Krishna and embracedHim tightly as soon as He entered his house. Akrura was a182Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995highly purified soul. He was completely sathwic in character.Kamsa also knew this truth. That is why Kamsa hand-pickedAkrura for the task of inviting Krishna to Mathura. Kamsa re-alized that Krishna and Balarama would never come toMathura if they were invited by anyone besides Akrura. Ak-rura’s heart was so pure that God could never refuse him any-thing.People who are not familiar with the Bhagavathamconsider Akrura to be an ordinary man, or a cruel man. No, no.Akrura was the embodiment of purity. He had no bodily at-tachment. He considered everything as God’s property andacted as per the Divine command. He had no trace of attach-ment, even to his wife and children. He contemplated inces-santly on Lord Narayana. Understand the character of suchpure devotees and acquire their qualities.[Bhagavan concluded with the bhajan “GovindaKrishna Jai, Gopala Krishna Jai, Gopala Bala Bala RadhaKrishna Jai!”]

Kuchela (or Sudama) was Krishna’s friend at school. Years later, as ahouseholder, Kuchela was very poor. He visited Krishna and took a fistfulof dry rice, recalling His childhood liking for it. However, awed byKrishna’s royal stature, Kuchela hid his humble gift. Krishna, the All-knowing, grabbed the soiled bundle and ate the plain rice with relish. WhenKuchela returned home, he found that his hut had become a palace, and hisfamily was living in abundance.3. Sathyabhama, a wife of Krishna, wanted to “buy” Him for herself withher wealth.

The leaf balanced Krishna’s weight, therebyhumbling Sathyabhama’s pride.4. Bhagavad Gita (IX:26).5. A demoness killed by Rama Avatar.6. The King of demons, humbled by Vamana Avatar.11.

The Upanishads define manava (man) tomean “one who trusts and can be trusted”. Every person livesonly on the basis of this trust or faith. From dawn to dusk, allour activities are made possible only by faith.Education must promote faith in GodTo what ends do people use faith? Do they use it toperform daily tasks, to be blissful, or in service to others? Domen use faith in the right direction? We have faith in every-thing. It is only with faith that we go to the market or travel ina car. We promise to fulfill tasks in the future, fully expectingto be alive the next day. All actions are initiated only by faith.But humans, who have faith in everything, do not have faith inthe existence and omnipotence of God.What is the reason? Worldly objects are related to thesenses. The power beyond the senses, although omnipresent, isinvisible. For this reason, man is not able to believe in it. Butdoes man believe only what he sees and reject everything thatSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995185is unseen? Can he see his mind? Is his happiness visible tohim? Although they are invisible, he knows they exist. But dueto weakness, he trusts only the visible. So he doesn’t trust hisown mind, his Self. Our ancient culture urges us to pursue edu-cation in order to cultivate strong, immovable faith in the Real-ity. What kind of education? Not worldly education.

People only think that they get happiness from sucheducation, but it is temporary. Lasting bliss is obtained only inspiritual education.

Till then, the boys hadnot even learned the alphabet. Why? Nanda and Yasoda wereafraid that if they admitted Krishna into any gurukula, Kamsamight send demons there and endanger the lives of many otherchildren.In the interest of true education, it was the practice inancient India to send children away from home to a gurukulawhere everyone, whether sons of emperors or ordinary people,stayed as equals in the guru’s house. You heard Prahlada’sstory. Although he was a prince, he stayed in the house of hisgurus, Chanda and Amarka. He did not stay at home like “day-scholars” of today.So, Krishna and Balarama were sent to the hermitage ofGuru Sandipani. Sandipani’s ashram was neither in MathuraSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995187nor in Brindavan. It was in the holy city of Kasi. LeavingKrishna and Balarama in Kasi, their parents lived fearlessly inMathura. The students of those days excelled in physicalprowess and intellectual acumen. Still, they were ever humbleand obedient and tread the path of sathya and dharma underthe guru’s guidance.Although Krishna and Balarama had destroyed manydemons in infancy and earned universal fame, they performedhousehold chores in Sandipani’s house, lived their guru’scommands and acquired true education. They would go into theforest daily and fetch firewood for the kitchen. Only by fol-lowing the disciplines of the gurakulas in humility, students ofthose days transformed themselves into ideal men and set glo-rious examples for posterity.Sandipani had only one son, who died young. Sandipaniand his wife bore this burden of sorrow with great effort. Inthose days, there was a practice called guru dakshina. Aftercompleting their education, before departing to become house-holders, students would make a token offering of gratitude totheir guru. This offering was guru dakshina. Balarama andKrishna also went to Sandipani. Standing humbly with foldedhands, they prayed, “Guru Deva! It is time for us to returnhome. Kindly tell us what we may offer to you as guru dak-shina.”Sandipani said, “My dear sons! It was my greatestgood fortune to be guru to ideal students like you. Your prow-ess and divine attributes are known the world over. Duringyour stay here, your behavior was exemplary, not requiring a188Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995single corrective remark from me. What can I ask of divine per-sonages like you?” Thinking for awhile, Sandipani said,“Balarama, Krishna! You are all-knowing and all-powerful.Once you resolve upon a task, you achieve it under all circum-stances. I have cherished a desire for long. My son died manyyears ago. I want you to resurrect him and bring him back tome.”Balarama and Krishna set out. With their superhumanabilities, after much exertion, they were able to bring the boyback to life. In this manner, they exemplified how studentsshould spend time in a gurukula, display humility and self-confidence, honor the guru, and enhance the reputation of theirparents.The establishment of dharmaMeanwhile, the King of Magadha, Jarasandha, alongwith his allies, attacked Mathura. Jarasandha was Kamsa’s fa-ther-in-law. He hated Krishna and wanted to avenge Kamsa’sdeath. Jarasandha attacked not once or twice but seventeentimes! Hearing this news, Balarama and Krishna hurried toMathura from Sandipani’s hermitage. The brothers thought,“Why have we taken Avatars? To free the world from sinners,to strengthen the forces of good.”By killing Jarasandha, his gargantuan armies would notbe depleted. So they decided to eradicate his army and sparehim. Whenever Jarasandha attacked, Krishna and Balarama an-nihilated his army and sent him back unharmed. Jarasandhawould return with another army, go back defeated again and soSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995189on. Thus, he invited humiliation upon himself seventeen times.Finally, Krishna eliminated Jarasandha also.All the kings who professed friendship with Jarasandhaformed a clique. Name a king, and he was a hater of Krishna.These kings began harassing Yadavas. Krishna gave this mattermuch thought. He wanted to provide sanctuary to Yadavas in asecure place. He summoned the architect of the heavens, Vish-vakarma, and told him to build a city in the middle of the sea.Vishvakarma could construct any structure by mere willing. Heobeyed Krishna and built Dwaraka. overnight, Krishna trans-ported all Yadavas to this miraculous city.The world still abounded in tyrants and demons, andBalarama and Krishna evolved strategies to destroy them.Dwaraka was the most beautiful city in the world. Dwaraka’sbeauty spoke of its heavenly origin, in contrast to man-madecities, which were plain. Yadavas were able to lead secure andhappy lives in Dwaraka. Students should recognize the differ-ence between Yadavas and gopikas.Humility and obedienceYadavas thought, “Krishna is our relative, our friend.”They related to Krishna with attachment based on pride. Thiswrong kind of attachment fed their ego constantly, bringingabout their destruction many years later. But the gopikas weredifferent. Instead of telling Krishna, “You are ours,” they said,“We are Yours.” This surrender earned them security and di-vine Love all their lives. Humility and obedience poured out ofthe gopalas and gopikas. Humility and obedience are very es-sential for everyone, especially for students.190Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Education teaches humility.Humility grants deservedness.Deservedness bestows wealth.Wealth facilitates acts of dharma.Dharma Grants Fulfillment Here and Hereafter.The student stage is a peculiar period. It comes andgoes as a flash across the screen of life. It is in youth that manruins his future years. Young people run after fleeting joys andjeopardize the rest of their life. Human life itself is temporary.And this period of youth is still more temporary! Students to-day enter into unnecessary gossip, indulge in unrighteous acts,pursue destructive goals and cause insecurity to the nation.This is not what students should be doing.Expand your heartStudents are meant to establish peace and security inthe nation and the world. They should serve fellowmen andaspire for the welfare of all. This should be their chief aim. Butsadly, they follow the opposite path. Modern students haveno respect for gurus, no love or respect for parents. Who elsewill they respect? What good is their schooling if such is theirbehavior? Prahlada said, “Father! I have learnt the essence of alleducation.” What is this essence? It is only the expansion ofthe heart, blossoming of discrimination.But the students of today have extremely narrowhearts. Their love is “contracted”. Therefore, students need topractice “expansion of love”. You must renounce the distinc-tions of “I” and “they”. Just as you amass wealth by workingSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995191diligently over years, you must amass peace and contentmentby entertaining divine feelings. Humanness can be transformedinto Divinity only when peace and contentment are allowed toflourish.One who knows swimming (eeta) does not worry aboutthe depth of the water. Similarly, one who knows Gita is notworried about the unrest in the world. He just follows the di-vine command, lends peace to the society and crosses thisocean of birth and death.Therefore, we must practice God’s words in everysituation. Not just practice, but derive bliss therefrom andshare it with others. Instead of selfishness (svaartham), shareyour joy with others in the spirit of spirituality (paraartham).Only then can society become ideal.Students! You were born in society, brought-up in soci-ety and you are living in society. If you are not sensitive to theneeds of society, for how long do you expect society to nour-ish you? Through your education, you must ensure peace andsecurity for all. We should not lead a life of isolation like a dropof oil on a leaf. You should live in harmony, in unity with all.Understand the suffering and pain of others and make efforts torelieve them, thereby increasing your own purity. Only thenwill your life be meaningful.Students are future leaders. The ones on whom the fu-ture will place such responsibility should promote righteous-ness. If we have only God’s Grace, we need not fear whereverwe go. Exert your utmost to become worthy of such Grace.The one who buys a ticket can sit anywhere in a train. He is192Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995not worried about anyone asking him to leave. But the tick-etless passenger mistakes every uniformed official for the ticketcollector! He is in constant fear. Likewise, the one who ac-quires the ticket of divine Grace can go anywhere withoutworry. He will not bend in any situation.Faith in yourself is faith in GodToday, we experience frustration, worry and fear everymoment. What is the reason? We have no faith. Faith is abso-lutely essential. Lack of faith makes man susceptible to imagi-nary fears. What is faith? You must believe in yourself! That isself-confidence. Self-confidence is the strong foundation of ourlives. On this foundation build the wall of self-satisfaction. Laythe roof of self-sacrifice on this wall. Then you will earn thebliss of Self-realization.First develop self-confidence, without which you willexperience many troubles. Self-confidence is faith in God. Onewith such faith has no problems. Lack of self-confidence is alsothe reason for not doing well at studies. Students say, “I study,but I don’t remember my lessons.” One without self-confidence lacks memory power. With self-confidence comesmemory power. Hence, develop confidence and stand out asexamples.Students! First believe in yourselves! Faith in your-self and faith in God—this is the secret of greatness. Lifewill have no value if you do not have faith in yourself. You andGod are not separate. Faith in yourself is the same as faith inGod.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995193Swami wants students to be ideal. With ideal students,Bharath will become an ideal nation. Mainly, students shouldnot entertain differences of community, caste, religion, color,and nationality. All are children of God. “Brotherhood of Man.Fatherhood of God.” People of all nations are humans. There isonly the caste of humanity. All are brothers, brothers, brothers.But there is one feeling higher than the feeling of broth-erhood. That is the sense of unity on the basis of the OneAtma. Sometimes there is animosity even between brothers. So,the unity of the Atma is better than brotherhood. It is not easyto develop, but do not give up, saying it is not possible.You can achieve WHATEVER you desire! Studentsshould cultivate such determination. Without determination,you cannot achieve anything. Don’t say, “I will try.” Say, “Imust do!” Don’t even use the word “try.” If you say “try”, itwill be “dry”! So say, “I must do.”Observe LimitsStudents are not at fault. Parents and teachers lead themastray. How? They consider worldly life to be permanent. Yes,we need worldly life. But there is something beyond. An ex-ample: Consider a game of football [soccer] with six players oneach team. There are goal posts at either end. If the ball passesbetween the posts, a goal is scored. The two goal posts areworldly and spiritual knowledge. Our life is the ball. The sixevil qualities (lust, anger, greed, envy, pride, attachment) areone team. Sathya, Dharma, Santhi, Prema, Ahimsa, and Prak-ruthi Dharma (worldly responsibility) form the other team.The ball of life is kicked by both teams. The ball should pass194Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995between the two boundary posts to score a goal. Beyond theboundary posts, it is only “out,” not a goal.Today, you are kicking the ball beyond the boundaries.Hence you are not succeeding. Act within limits, and you willbe victorious. Nah Sreyoh Niyainam Vinah—Lasting happinesscannot be gained without limits and rules. Without limits, life ismeaningless. For example. body temperature has a limit of98.4°F. 99°F is considered a fever. Blood pressure is normal at120/80. If it touches 90, it signals trouble.Similarly, our eyes can see only a limited brightness.Too much brightness burns the retina. Life is a “limited com-pany”. Do not cultivate ego. Earn respect by observing limits.You will ruin your minds with unlimited desire. It isnormal to have ambitions, but ensure that your ideals are pure.Note the difference between desires (aasa) and ideals (aasaya).It does not matter if desires are not realized, but take care thatideals are never violated. Students should be disciplined. With-out discipline, life becomes an animal’s existence. Cultivate dis-cipline in your daily lives and become ideal men and women.12. The Essence Of EducationNa Tvevaaham Jaatu NaasamNa Thwam Neme JanaadhipaahNa Chaiva Na Bhavishyaamah,Sarve Vayamatah Param.There was never a time when I,Or you, or any of these ruling Kings did not exist.And we shall exist in the future,For all time hereafter.1The universe is full of many powers. An omniscient,omnipotent and omnipresent power pervades all of Creation.This divine Force is immanent in every atom, like sugar insyrup. The Upanishads call this Raso Vai Sah or all-pervadingsweetness. God is an embodiment of sweetness. Although thissweetness is everywhere, it is not possible to recognize its om-nipresence. However, it is possible for all to observe the exis-tence of Divinity.The existence of DivinitySweetness in sugarcane, bitterness in neem2 leaves,burning in chili, acerbity in lemon and fire in wood—all theseare direct proofs of God’s existence. A plant germinates from aseed. A bird emerges from an egg. The newborn infant becomesa mother one day. These are all living proofs of the existence ofDivinity. Man experiences exhilaration upon seeing majesticpeaks, gurgling rivers, the deep ocean, lush forests and colorfulgardens. What is the basis of these phenomena? It is God’s ex-istence alone.It is not given to everyone to grasp the omnipresence ofGod, but all have the capacity to identify His presence.Jnaanaanaam Jnaanam Agram, Jnaanaanaam Jnaanam Utta-196Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995mam—Of all kinds of knowledge, Atma Jnana is the foremostand the best. We find various forms of knowledge in theworld—music, literature, painting, sculpture, dance, materialsand so on. Atma Jnana is paramount. Worldly knowledge mightendow you with scholarship, fame, honor and titles. But, At-maanaam Atmam Uttamam—The title higher than all worldlytitles is that you are the Atma. The Vedas say that man is Am-ritaputra—a child of immortality. This is the highest title.Qualities for earning wisdomAll worldly knowledge changes with time and deludesyour intellect. For this reason, our ancient sages dedicated theirlives to the acquisition of Atma Jnana, which is changeless andillumines the intellect. Some qualities are necessary for earningsuch wisdom.1. Sarve Loka Hito RatahDesire the welfare of all beings by engaging in actionsthat benefit others. We should cultivate readiness toserve. Your education should equip you better to renderservice. Then you will evoke true respect from others.2. Sarve Jnaana SampannahStudents should excel in all forms of knowledge. This isalso called “awareness.” You should understand and ex-perience all the angles of a situation. Worldly subjectsgrant you competence within a narrow scope. You per-ceive situations with a limited outlook. If I ask youwhat this [handkerchief] is, you say, “a piece of cloth”.This answer shows your restricted, worldly knowledge.With broader vision, you identify it as a handkerchief.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995197Spiritual knowledge is complete and enables one tograsp all fields of knowledge. This is “total awareness”.3. Sarve Samuditha GunaihiThe student must embody every virtue or guna. Whatis meant by guna? Traditionally, the three qualities ofcreation (sathwa, rajas, and tamas) are called gunas.Indeed, virtue is the union and balance of these threegunas. In practice, it is very important to disregard thefaults of others and to express your own Divinity. Thisis true guna. This trait is crucial for students and it isthe source of all virtues. That which inculcates such vir-tue alone can be called education. Modern educationalsystems impart information but not virtues.Present-day education teaches only information,But not even an iota of virtue.What beneficial fruit can emerge fromA million forms of education, devoid of values?NonviolenceWithout human values you cannot deliver the fruits ofyour learning to society. Therefore, human values must be cul-tivated. Of these, sathya is the most important. Truth is God.Some people went to Buddha and argued about the existence ofGod. Buddha told them, “All these disputes are a waste oftime. Sathya, dharma, and ahimsa are the same as God. There-fore, worship God as the form of Truth first. Speak the truth.Practice dharma. Observe nonviolence.”198Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Now, what is meant by nonviolence? People consideronly hurting and harming others as violence. No, no. Harmingyourself is also violence. Talking unnecessarily, eating immod-erately, and working too much—these are violence. Meaning,one should lead a life of moderation and balance. Anythingdone beyond limits is violence. Even writing excessively isviolence. Why is it bad to transgress limits? Because it wastesenergy. By talking more than necessary, we deplete our intel-lect.Therefore, nonviolence can be defined as the regulationof human life along moderate and beneficial paths. The Vedassay, Sathyam Vada, Dharmam Chara—Speak the truth andfollow dharma. Truth is God. Right action is God. That is whythe Vedas advise us to adhere to sathya and dharma. This istrue virtue.Individual soul and All-pervading SoulNowadays, people make many attempts to reach Di-vinity. But they go around in circles because some spiritualconcepts have been left inadequately explained for a long time.These are: jeeva and Deva (individual soul and God), Atma andParamatma (limited soul and all-pervading soul), Anu andBrahmaanu (atom and universe), sthoolam and sookshmam(gross and subtle). No one is able to interpret these conceptscorrectly today.Vedanta discovered such profound concepts which sci-ence has never been able to fathom. On the other hand, sciencehas gathered facts that Vedanta considered unessential. But inspite of investigations by both scientists and Vedantins, theseSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995199basic truths are not understood properly by the common man.How should we describe Divinity? What is the distinction be-tween Atma and Paramatma, between Anu and Brahmaanu?If we reflect, the atom and the universe are one and thesame! This tumbler has water from River Godavari. Supposewe bring Godavari water in a huge pot. And then again, in a bigtanker. All of them are the same water. They differ only inquantity. Quality is one.In the same way, when we study the atom we comeacross microcosmic phenomena. In the flame of a lamp, we findheat and light. Upon closer examination, a flame has the sameinnate qualities as an atom. The water in this tumbler has thesame taste, color and form as that in River Godavari. This isThat, That is This. When we grasp this one principle, we graspeverything.God is described in our scriptures as AnoraneeyaanMahato Maheeyaan—smaller than the smallest, bigger than thebiggest. The universe is really a reflection of the same forcespresent in an atom. Without the combination of atoms, the uni-verse cannot exist. The principle that is present in all is Divin-ity alone.This is what Sage Uddalaka taught his son.3 “Son, Godis everywhere. Observe the relation between an atom and thecosmos and you will understand Atma and Paramatma. Gointo the house and bring some sugar and some water.” His sonobeyed. Uddalaka said, “Observe the sugar carefully.” The boylooked at it and felt it. Then he mixed it in water. Then Udda-200Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995laka asked him to find the sugar. But the sugar could not becollected with the hand because it had dissolved. Still, its pres-ence could be proved by tasting a drop of the sweet water.Where was the sugar? It cannot be said to be “here” or “there”.It was everywhere in the water.In the same way, the sugar that can be seen and touchedis Atma. It is limited. The sugar that is dissolved, which is be-yond touch and sight, beyond name and form, beyond spatiallimitations, is Paramatma. The Atma present in your body alsopervades the universe as Paramatma. Paramatma is calledConsciousness. The Atma in the body is called Conscience.That Consciousness is present in your Conscience and yourConscience is a part of the Consciousness.A seed contains roots, branches, leaves, fruits,flower—everything. Krishna said, Beejam Maam SarvaBhootaanaam4—I am the seed of all beings. This seed is pre-sent in the mighty tree and the entire tree is present within theseed. Anoraneeyaan—smaller than the smallest—that is theseed. Mahatomaheeyaan—bigger than the biggest—this is thetree. There is no difference between the seed and the tree. Thedifference is only in vision. Meaning, the extroverted visionsees multiple forms but the inner eye perceives unity in diver-sity.Know yourselfTherefore, it is not possible for anyone to recognizethis all-pervasive Divinity. But that is not required! If you rec-ognize the divine spark present in yourself, you become theSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995201knower of the omnipresent Divinity also! That is why Vedantaurges man, “Know Thyself.”If you ask a person, “Who are you?” he answers, “I amthe son of...” Or he may say he is a doctor or a lawyer. Or hemay say, “American,” “Indian,” “Italian.” None of these is cor-rect. When you base your identity on your father, you speakout of body-consciousness. Doctor or lawyer is your profes-sion. The third response is your country of birth. These an-swers are like artificial dialogue heard in a cinema. Your truenature is Atma. No one can change the conscience in each per-son. You may change countries and behavior, but not the con-science.The principle present in everyone is the Atma. Modernpeople do not perform such subtle investigations and so, donot believe these truths. They dedicate their time, body andactions to this temporary, physical existence. Hence, they giveonly worldly responses. Jnaanaanaam Jnaanam Utta-mam—Atma Jnana is the best kind of knowledge. Once youhave Atma Jnana, you may blend other sciences in it. AtmaJnana is the ocean, worldly sciences are rivers. NadeenaamSaagaro Gatih—all rivers merge into the ocean.A small example. Rice is your staple food. But you donot eat rice by itself. You mix vegetables and curries in it. Withsuch side dishes you can enjoy a tasty meal. Take the rice ofAtma Vidya and mix into it the dishes of worldly knowledge.This will lend taste to your physical life. In any situation,Atma Vidya must never be renounced.202Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Brahma, Vishnu, and MaheswaraThe principles that teach and nourish Atma Vidya, sus-tain its awareness and protect it are known as Brahma, Vishnu,and Maheswara. These are only names. Today, there is no onewho has seen these Beings. Yes, we see them in cinemas andbooks, but no one has seen them directly. As per jnana phi-losophy, this is delusion also!Truly, who is this Brahma and where is He? Brahma isthe Creator. The subtle secrets of the Creator are present inevery mother and father. The parents who bestow this physi-cal body on you have all the qualities of Brahma. Make everyeffort to understand the sacred principles in your parents. Yourmother is the basis of your birth. She sustained you andbrought you into this world. The one who created you is noneother than your mother. The mother fosters her child in hun-dreds of ways, like Brahma. Therefore, when you respect yourmother and worship her, you worship Brahma. That is whyour ancients said, Maatru Devo Bhava—The mother is equal toGod.Birth is not enough. The means to live must be pro-vided to the child. When the child ventures into the world, itmust be taught right behavior. The ways for earning respect insociety must be inculcated. Education and a home must be fur-nished. All these are responsibilities of the father. Lord Vishnusustains and protects the souls created by Brahma. That sameVishnu is the father. When you worship and honor your father,you truly worship Vishnu.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995203Next, Maheswara. He is described as bhola (innocent)by devotees. He is known for granting every desire, withouthesitation, even if the boons might result in trouble to Him! Heis sulabha priya—easily pleased. You know the story of thedemon Bhasmaasura. Maheswara gave him the boon of burninganything with his palm. Then He Himself ran to escape thedemon’s palm! What does this mean? Sankara grants desireswithout prejudice or hesitation. A guru teaches all withoutpreference. To one who wants proficiency in mathematics, theteacher teaches math. If another desires physics, that is taught.The guru teaches whatever one wishes to learn, to anyone whocomes with the desire. When the student’s desires are not ele-vating, he advises him accordingly. No student turns back froma guru empty-handed. Thus, the guru is equal to Maheswara.When you respect your guru, you really worship Maheswara.Pillars of Indian cultureTherefore, Hindus consider mother, father, and teacheras being equal to God. The Vedas propagate these glorious val-ues by saying:Maatru Devo Bhava.Pitru Devo Bhava.Acharya Devo Bhava.Treat the mother as God.Treat the father as God.Treat the teacher as God.This is Indian Culture. This is the first pillar of Indianculture: devotion and obedience to mother, father, and guru.204Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995Next, in what manner must a child born of such parentsconduct himself in society? Speak the truth, he is advised.Never yield to falsehood out of selfishness. Never follow un-righteousness for self-interest. To uphold our respect in soci-ety, we should speak the truth and follow dharma. Indian Cul-ture says:Sathyam Vada, Dharmam CharaSpeak the truth, Follow dharma.This is the second identifying feature of Indian Culture.Not just this. If we want to experience unsullied reputa-tion, we must strengthen the faith that Divinity is immanent ineveryone. These days, scientists claim that a microcosmicpower pervades the universe. They conduct complex experi-ments to convince the world of their findings. There are onlytwo components present in this world: matter and energy. Onecannot exist without the other. Science investigates into the in-teractions of matter and energy, into the physical world acces-sible to the senses.Spirituality teaches the same concept: People may bedifferent. Names and forms may differ, cultures may differ, butthe force within everyone is the One Atma. Scientists tookthousands of years to discover this truth. Since when? Not justin the modern era. The first scientist, the greatest scientist, wasHiranya Kashyapa, who existed thousands of years ago. Hi-ranya Kashyapa investigated into the five elements that consti-tute creation. He even brought the elements under his control!Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995205But despite his towering accomplishments in the physicalrealm, Hiranya Kashyapa could not limit his own bad qualities.For this reason, what did our ancients teach? Science ispreoccupied with describing the forces within an atom. Ourancient Vedanta says, “O foolish scientists! First of all, every-thing is in You!” The external world has been described by sci-entists. The inner cosmos is the subject of Vedanta. Scientistsare reluctant to develop inner vision. And Vedanta has ne-glected the external world. But which of these is more impor-tant?Students should recognize one fact. You can see thebranches, leaves, flowers, and fruits of a tree. But the bases fortheir existence are the unseen roots. Which are more important,roots or branches? Without roots, branches cannot exist. How-ever, you may chop off the branches and the roots will makethem grow again. Those who are content understanding thebranches, venturing no further, are scientists. The ones who goto the roots are Vedantins.Scientists describe the branches, the effects, not thecause. Therefore, the moolaadhaara—Primal Cause—is veryimportant. Once we find the Primal Cause behind everything,we can build a foundation upon it and live in the world as weplease.Students know that two parts of hydrogen and one partof oxygen produce water. Scientists pride themselves on thisdiscovery. Yes, you can produce water. But if we ask, “Whocreated hydrogen and oxygen?” there is no answer. When con-fronted by such questions, scientists evade them by saying,206Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995“Law of Nature”. Fine. From where did Nature emerge? Who isits basis? When we inquire in this fashion, the moolaadhaara isGod alone. No one can grasp Divinity. We can only attempt todescribe it as a power that is changeless, indestructible, om-nipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient.The study that reveals to us our innate Divinity hasbeen termed vidya (education). Worldly studies do not measureup to this qualification. However, worldly studies have gottheir importance. Today man studies, gets a job, goes overseas,accepts positions of authority—all for money alone. DhanaMoolam Idam Jagat—Money is the basis for the world.Money is the basis for worldly existence. But Vedanta doesnot give it such importance.Dharma moolam idam jagatDharma is the basis for the world. This is the declara-tion of Vedanta. This is Indian Culture.You find planets revolving around the Sun, stars in dis-tant galaxies shining brightly, the Moon orbiting the Earth, riv-ers flowing into the ocean, the sea rising and ebbing with tides,and so on. All these phenomena occur within the limits ofdharma. When dharma is transgressed, all is destroyed. Allthese activities are possible only by adherence to dharma.These are proofs of God’s existence.Yearn for true knowledgeTo discover the existence of God is within everyone’scapability. You do not need degrees, education, skills, or profi-ciencies for this achievement. All that is required is an effort toSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995207understand the secrets of Creation. Look at this world. It is sovast, so full of wonders. From where has it emerged? There are5,700 million people in the world. Are any two identical? Arethere no distinctions even between identical twins? Every indi-vidual is unique. Who designed such a wondrous creation? Thisact of creation is not possible for anyone. The mind cannotgauge its wonders.Thus, the unseen Divinity underlies the visible world.Some people think, “I have attained this,” “I have made thisdiscovery through my experiments.” They gloat over the small-est of achievements. What the man of today knows is close tonothing. But the pomp is huge. One who knows does not in-dulge in publicity. The vessel full of water remains steady. Thehalf-full vessel rocks back and forth noisily. Those who yieldto self-praise have half understanding.Inquire, inquire, inquire. Make a determined attempt.Don’t relax your spiritual efforts in any way. What we need torecognize is the moolaadhaara principle. This principle is notvisible through a telescope and cannot be captured through acamera. You only need yearning in your heart, which getstransformed into spiritual inquiry. Without yearning, the searchfor God cannot be sustained. Every student should cultivateyearning, “I should know, I should know.” Then you will real-ize the fruits of your search for God, sooner or later.Desires vs. idealsDevelop good thoughts. Your desires may or may notbe fulfilled. Students! You are living for desires (aasa) today.This is not the right approach. Live for ideals (aasaya). Even if208Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995your desires are satisfied today, what is the guarantee that to-morrow’s desires will be granted? But if you uphold ideals,people will follow your example long after you die. Do notbase your life on desires—you are bound to meet disappoint-ment one day or the other. The only desire you should have isthe desire to follow ideals!Today man wishes for a long life. This is not important.A life permeated with divine feelings is more desirable. A di-vine life, even for a moment, brings lasting bliss and fame. Whatis the meaning in surviving for a thousand years if you live acrow’s life? So, do not be satisfied with worldly education.While pursuing your studies, acquire Atma Vidya as well.Unity of thought, word, and deedOnce, Adi Sankaracharya went with thirteen disciplesto Kashi. With our extroverted intellect, we think that “sin”means inconveniencing or harming others. Students should rec-ognize correctly what is meant by sin. Sankara was proceedingfor a bath in River Ganga. He saw a boy, seated under a tree,learning by heart the rules of grammar (dukrum-karane).Sankaracharya stood for some time, observing the student re-cite his lessons aloud. Then Sankara approached him.“My boy, why do you spend time learning grammar?”The student replied, “This will help me become a greatscholar.” “Good. What do you hope to achieve after becominga scholar?” “I will go to the King’s court and become the RoyalPoet.” “Fine, you will become famous. What will that famegive you?” “With fame, I will get as much wealth as I want.”“What happiness can you enjoy with wealth?” “My familySummer Showers in Brindavan 1995209will live in pleasure and comfort.” “How long will that comfortlast?” “Till death.” “What will happen to you, your comfortsand riches after death?” “I don’t know.”Then Sankara said:Bhaja Govindam Bhaja GovindamGovindam Bhaja Moodha MateSampraapte Sannihite KaaleNahi Nahi Rakshati DukrunkaraneSing the name of Govinda,Sing Govinda’s name, O fool!When your final moments approach,The rules of grammar will not save you!Think of God always. Worldly knowledge is helpfulonly as long as the body exists. You must leave the body oneday or the other.After giving this advice, Sankaracharya bathed in theRiver Ganga and proceeded to the temple for Lord Siva’s dar-shan. He stood in front of the altar and prayed: “Swami! I havecome to You after committing three heinous sins. I pray to Youin expiation of those sins.” Students should pay careful atten-tion to his words.“I have extolled and described You in many ways.However, I know that You are Avaang Maanasa Gochara—beyond word and thought. The Vedas say, Yatho VaachoNivartante Apraapya Manasa Saha—From where words andthoughts return, unable to comprehend anything. That is You. I210Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995taught my students that You are beyond word and thought. Atthe same time, I dared to describe You. I preached somethingand practiced otherwise. This is my first sin.”See, how subtle is the concept of sin! To say somethingand do something else is sin. “I taught to everyone, IsvaraSarva Bhootaanaam, Isaavaasyam Idam Sarvam—God isimmanent in every being. You are present everywhere. But Ihave come to Kasi to see You as Viswesvara. Again, I actedcontrary to my words. This is my second sin.“Ekovasi Sarva Bhoota Antaraatma—God is presentin everyone. In fact, God is manifest as all beings. I taught thistruth. Now, am I not one of those beings? Is God not presentin me? I have neglected the Divinity in myself. I have jour-neyed here to see myself! I considered myself different fromYou. This is my third sin.“So, Lord, my words and actions are not in unity.Please free me from these faults.” Saying so, Sankaracharyaclosed His eyes and meditated intently on the Lord. In a fewmoments, He got the Lord’s vision along with His response.Visveswara told him, “Sankara! Past is past. Your repentanceitself is atonement for your sins. Take care that you do not re-peat these mistakes.”Meaning what? We must repent for our mistakes. Buttoday’s devotees have no sincere repentance. Whenever youcommit a mistake, even unknowingly, resolve, “I shall not re-peat it.” You must not go back on your promise to God. Keepyour words and actions in unison. In the modern age it has beenSummer Showers in Brindavan 1995211said—The proper study of mankind is man. Meaning, theunity of thoughts, words, and actions.Keeping these three in unity, love and respect yourparents and teacher. Consider your mother, father, and teacheras Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheswara and make every effort tosecure their blessings. This is true worship. But we must notbe content even with this. Do not stop there and waste the sa-cred time at our disposal. There is an unknown power pervad-ing everything. This sacred power is within your mother, fatherand teachers. You must think, “I will worship, follow and at-tain that Divinity.” For this reason, bhajans, japa, meditation,and sathsanga are very essential.Good companyNow the term sathsanga (good company) is frequentlymisunderstood. What is sathsanga? Getting together withdevotees, singing bhajans, undertaking pilgrimages, listening tointerpretations of scriptures—these are common conceptionsof sathsanga. But this is only worldly sathsanga. In fact, theseare not sathsanga at all! The devotees around you have manyfaults. Scholars also explain scriptures with some expectationin mind. So, none of these can be true sathsanga.Sath is derived from Sath-chith-ananda—Being,Awareness, Bliss. Sath is Being. Not this temporary, worldlybeing, but the Being that remains changeless through past, pre-sent and future. Sath is devoid of name and form. The form ofSath is bliss (Ananda). Sath is God.Cultivating thoughts of God is true sathsanga!212Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995We must acquire the company of Godly thoughts, andthereby, the company of God Himself. Assimilate the principleof the Atma.When we do this, Chith (Awareness) dawns. When weinquire into God, all knowledge, all awareness becomes part ofus. That total awareness is Chith. Now, bliss (Ananda) is thenatural consequence of Sath and Chith coming together.So, the quality of Sath is changeless. When these con-cepts are taught with simple analogies, children absorb themeasily. Sath is sugar. You may mix sugar in pudding, tea, coffee,water—its sweetness is constant. Sath is the sweetness. God isthe embodiment of sweetness. Madhuraadhipate MadhuramMadhuram—God is sweetness, sweetness, sweetness. In onehand, take this sugar of Sath. In the other hand, takeChith—awareness of the Atma. Everyone may not be able touse Sath. For example, diabetic patients are barred from sugar!Atheists are like diabetics. They do not look at the sugar ofSath, although they have the desire to taste it! But their diseasedoes not allow them to taste the sweetness.However, Chith—total awareness—is essential for eve-ryone. Chith is like water. No one can survive without water.Water is crucial for life. Therefore, water is a form of Divinity.All need water, be they millionaires or paupers, renunciants orhedonists. This water is jnana—knowledge, awareness. Mixsugar and water. The result is neither sugar not water, butsyrup. Unite Sath and Chith, and the syrup of Ananda (bliss)will flow in you.Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995213Use education to serve societySo, students! Think of God on one hand. Pursueworldly education on the other hand. Experience the sweetnessof life by the unity of these two. Life is meant to be of serviceto others. We must be careful never to cause suffering to oth-ers. Imbibe such skills and knowledge that will benefit you, so-ciety and the world. Do not learn just to fulfill your self-interest. If you want to fall to a selfish state, why take thetrouble to be educated? You don’t need scriptures and spiritualinquiry in order to become selfish! But to attain selflessness,you definitely need education.In the past ten days, you have participated in thisSummer Course on culture and spirituality. Sathya andDharma—these are our culture. Maatru Devo Bhava, PitruDevo Bhava, Acharya Devo Bhava—these constitute our cul-ture. When you keep these three injunctions in view, when youexperience Divinity in these three relations, only then will youexperience the unity of culture and spirituality, or the unity ofmatter and energy.Matter + Energy = God.Observe limitsOffer worldly resources back to the world in usefulforms. There is nothing useless anywhere. We see a twig on theground and think it is useless. No, no. Even that is useful, forinstance, as a toothpick! But today, man himself is useless andwasted. Why? Man does not know his own value. What is hisvalue? Man wrongly bases his worth on position, fame, degreesand wealth. Yes, all these may be desired—but within limits.214Summer Showers in Brindavan 1995When we cross limits, they become dangerous instead of lend-ing enjoyment.Suppose you are thirsty. Quench your thirst with aglass of water. But today’s man says, “I am not satisfied witha glass. I want to drink the whole River Ganga!” If you try todrink Ganga, it will drown you. This is only danger, not en-joyment. Another example. You need air to live. Do you try toinhale all the air in the world? The five elements must be usedwithin limits. The body needs heat to survive. But the bodycannot function with excessive heat, like a 105°F temperature.Have limits, have limits, have limits.Students! Pursue education, acquire positions and re-move the unrest that plagues society. There are many agita-tions around us. All of you should establish peace and securityin society and stand out as examples —blessing you with thiswish, I bring My long discourse to a close.
