Second Volume ofourEnglish Translation of
theSusruta Samhita. Thearduous task ofcom-
piling aconnected and succint history ofany
part whatever, oftheancient Hindu System
ofMedicine—requires greater leisure andmore
extensive reading thanwecan layany pre-
tension to.Years ofpatient study and constant
discourse with our sainted preceptor the late
lamented Mahamahopadhyaya Kaviraj Dwaraka
Nath Sen, Kaviratna, thatrefulgent linkofthe
golden chain oftheDhanvantaric succession,
have enabled us,however, tograsp theleading
facts, andduring the lastfewyears wehave
worked continuously, inmoments snatched from
the practice ofananxious profession thatknows
norespite, toarrange these facts intheir present
form. Itbreaks ourheart torecord thesad
departure ofourvenerable Acharyya from this
sublunary sphere toaland"from whose bourne
notraveller e’erreturns.’’
Itishardly necessary forustoreply tothose
critics who,through their ignorance oftheoriginal
( )
Sanskrit works, persist indescribing Ayurveda
asanempirical system destitute ofAnatomy,
Physiology orPathology inany scientific sense.
Itbehoves us,however, inthispreface tomeet
some ofthecharges which have beenbrought
against us.
Exception hasbeen taken toournotinclud-
ing intheopening stanza theusual invocation
totheSupreme Self (forasuccessful completion
ofthework) although ithasfound itsway into
almost alltheprinted editions ofthework extant.
Now thestanza referred tofindsnoplace in
thevarious manuscript copies ofthe original
work which are inourpossession, oronwhich
wehavebeen able tolayourhands. Thework
was first putinto printbythelateDr.Madhu-
sudan Gupta andwebelieve that itwasonly
inthis printed edition that thebenedictory
address inquestion appeared forthefirst time,
andthat ithas since crept, bytheprocess of
circulation, intosubsequent printed editions.
Inthisopinion wearesupported bythe fact,
that innone ofthevarious commentaries andanno-
tations ontheSusruta Samhita isanymention
made ofthelineinquestion, whereas, had itbeen
theopening stanza oftheoriginal work, itwould
certainly have received atleast apassing notice
atthehands ofthecommentators, however easy
orsimple itmight have been. Further, were it
composed bySusruta himself, itwould nothave
(3)
been intheform inwhichwefind itintheprinted
editions. The ancient sages used invariably
theauspicious expression" ”or“ ’’
andthe like,when commencing awork and
never invoked anyparticular deity forahappy
termination oftheir undertaking.’^ These are
thereasons which have ledustoomit the
passage inourpresent translation.
Another objection raised byacertain section
ofthecommunity isthatweshould nothave at
allundertaken totranslate thework intothe
English language. Their contention isthatthe
Ayurveda, being anintegral portion ofthe
Eternal Vedas, should, onnoaccount, be
rendered intoaMleclichha Bhdshd andthusmade
accessible tothepublic atlarge, irrespective
ofcaste orcreed.
Suchanobjection, atthistimeoftheday, is,
tosaytheleast, most puerileITruth istruth, and
latitudes and longitudes arenot itsboundary
lines. TheVedas themselves have been trans-
lated intomany European languages. Tokeep
thetruths promulgated byourancient sages con-
fined within thecoterie oftheprivileged classes
and thus todeprive theeducated public ofthe

benefit ofsuch truths would certainly bea
sacrilege. Ingiving preference toEnglish as
themedium oftranslation wehavebeen actuated
bymore reasons than one.
Itcannot begainsaid thatEnglish hasnow
become almost thehngua fratica oftheworld,
andtodisseminate theancient wisdom ofIndia
throughout theworld, wecould nothave selected
amedium better than theEnglish language.
Besides this,wehave been actuated bythe
hope ofdrawing thedirect attention ofourbe-
nignGovernment tothescientific value ofour
system ofMedicine bytheadoption ofsucha
procedure.
Herewemust notstop without expressing
oursincere andhearty thanks toourlearned and
valued friends Kaviraj Jogindranath Sen,M.A.,

Though ItIScustomary andconvenient togroup apart

absence ofanyreference tobrain and

we feel thisabsence almost todespon-

noadmiration, but,onthecontrary, togenerate inscientific
minds anuniversal apathy, atlc.istanapathy towards allthat

IThe definition
ofAyns
Same asLife as
defined byMr.Her-
bertSpencerdistinctly possesses every characteristic
thatmarks theScience ofBiology.
The veryname Ayurvada indicates
that itisactually ascience ofAyus
and thewordAyus isused here inthe
same sense asMr.Herbert Spencer
understands byhisremarkable definition ofLife.
InInsmasterly classification Mr.Herbert Spencer has,
inhisBiology, given, indeed, the firstplace toAnatomy and
Physiology, but still itisdivested ofanyelaborate chapters
dealing withthesubjects.
iv IHTRODtrcTIOH.
Inthescience ofLifeashort reference tothestructures
ofthebody oritsfunctions isquite sufficient toillustrate
itsprinciples, and ifwefailtofindtherein anydiscourse on
the descriptive Anatomy andPhysiology, we stillconsider
thatthere isnothing amiss.
But unfortunately the fateofAyurveda isotherwise.
Though theveryname indicates that itisBiology pureand
simple, still ItISdenounced foritsdificiencies inAnatomy
andPhysiology, anddoomed forever.
Sanskrit words arenotorious for their confusion of
meanings, but, asregards Ayurveda there exists nodifference
ofopinion, atleast, sofarasthe firstword isconcerned.
Ayus isAyus everywhere inAyurveda and itistheonly fault
ourvenerable Bishis maybereasonably charged with, that
they didnotputthemselves into any great trouble to
explain Ayus, but,onthecontrary, unlike scientific men,
misspent their energy toascertain the significance ofthe
insignificant portion 0/Ayurveda, that isthemeanings ofthe
root“Vida” inthelight ofGrammar.
The scientific ear,ever unsatisfied with these grammati-
caleruditions, hasultimately thrust anEncyclopadic value
uponwhat isproperly speaking, abook ofBiology. Ofcourse,
there isamarked difference between thetwo.Anordinary
treatise onBiology deals with thegeneral truths oflife,
anddoes notrepresent, bywayofillustrations, allitsspecial
truths, northeir practical sides, but sofarasAyurveda is
concerned, thegeneral truths ofBiology arethrown intothe
background andthespecial truths, gleaned exclusively from
thescience ofmedicine, aregiven great prominence
),somuch so,that it isnow regarded
asasystem ofMedicine andSurgery which hasneither
Biology, norAnatomy, norPhysiology, norPathology—but
isasystematised Empiricism orQuackery. This iscertainly
agreat misfortune. Apart from thename, thearrangement
ofthesubject, towhich wehave just referred, atleast, in
thesection ofSarira-sthana (the falsely so-called Anatomy of

laternal evidence-theHindus),—isadirect contradiction toitsfaieng considered
asanEncyclopiedic work. The existence ofthechapters on
midwifery andmanagement ofinfants inthesame, following
immediately thechapters onAnatomy, serves asastrong
additional evidence thereof. Itisananomaly nodoubt,

From whatever standpoint welook tothequestion, we
findthere aregrounds toleadanyone topronounce in
ourfavour and tocome totheconclusion atwhich we
nowventure toarrive. Besides these twoimportant facts,
wenow cite thefollowing passage as
astrong internal evidence infavour of

who, thereupon, regained consciousness and feltquite at

goes toprove that theattendant physician ofBuddha, is
likewise recorded tohave practised cranial surgery writh the
greatest success. Instances ofsuccessful eases ofabdominal

ItIScertainly anundeniable factthatoneofthecolossal
achievements ofmodern Western Medical Science isits
Anatomy;butthepoint atissue iswhether theprocess of
Dissection.‘“Vne open the structures ofthebody

ISused 80reckless!]? toremove theskin allatonceand
notallowed togodeeper intothemuscles toexpose the
minute branches ofblood vessels andnerves thatmayhappe i
tolieembedded therein ?But,onthecontrary, look atthe
process promulgated bySusruta fordemonstrating practical
Anatomy 1Itsoriginality and perfection beats hollow all
theknown methods, although itwasdiscovered inalmost the
pre-historic age. The process prescribed bytheHindu
system isasfollows•—Cover adeadbody withKusa grass
andplace itattheedge ofthewater ofarivulet. After
three days take itout carefully, and gradually take off
the succsesive layers ofthe epidermis and dermis and
ofthemuscles beneath bygently andlightly rubbing itover
with asoft brush. Thus the smallest and thethinnest
arteries, which Iiave bytinstime swelled andobtained a
distinct existence aremade palpable everywhere even to
theminutest.
The process istermed, aswehavepointed before, Ava-
gharsliaiia bySusruta. TheWestern method might bean
easier andamore off-hand one, butbynomeans precise.
Though themerit ofdiscovering thismode
Avagharshana.^,jsection isduetoSusruta, weateall
blind toItand callHippocrates thefather ofMedicine 1Itis
'generally believed thatwithaview tofurther hisresearches
andperfect hisknowledge, itisHippocrates whoinaugurated
thesystem ofdissection ofdeadhuman bodies andhedid
thework secretly. Credulous people maylendawilling ear
tosuch assertions butthefact is,that itwasnot tillacentury
later that Hirophilus openly resorted todissection of
human bodies and thereby earned anundying fame in
Europe, obliterating Susruta's name forever, though, virtually
speaking, he(Susruta) was thepioneer ofdissection and
figured intheworld more than amillenium before the
advent ofHippocrates andover eleven centuries prior tothe
ageofHerophilus.
INTRODUCTION. xy
Itwoald not,perhaps, beoutofplace here tomention
that Dr.A.F.R.Hoernle, M.A,F.R.S,C.I.E.,Ph.D.,
inhisrecent publication onHindu Osteology, hasproved it
tothehilt,howsystematic, scientific, unerring andexact were
theresearches oftheancient Hindus andwhat amine of
resplendent truths layimbedded inthem !We, inourIntro-
duction ofthe firstvolume ofthiswork, have tried toprove
howverysuperb, salutary andsupremely happy wasthetheory
ofVayu, Pitta, andKapha promulgated bySusruta. There
wehave incidentally mentioned thattheScience ofEmbryo-
logywasnotunknown totheHindu sages. Inthepresent
volume wemean toprove toapoint thatthemain principles
promulgated intheAnatomy, thePhysiology andthePatho-
logyofSusruta yield innoway tothe principles onthose
subjects included bythemodern Western Scientists and
investigators. Ontheother hand,weboldly affirm that inthe
theories propounded bySusruta some twothousand years
back there liesafund oftruths which might wellthrow aflood
oflightonthefield oflabour ofthemodern scientific men of
theWest. For isitnotafactthatthetheories ofVamana
(causing toeject thecontents ofthestomach bymouth),
Virechana (causing theevacuation oftheintestines), Nasya
(causing toinhale through thenose), Anuvdsana andAslhd-
fana which, inancient India, hadearned theappellation of
Pancha-Karma, andhadgained universal prevalence, andwere
extensively practised byoriental physicians from timeim-
memorial, have, oflate,been hailed bythemedical authorities
oftheday asthemostapproved andcommended mode of
treatment.
Sceptics who carenortoexamine andweigh solid facts,
bluntly allege that theAyurvedic system isnotbased
upon experiment and observation— thekeystone of all
true Science, andsuchbeing thecase itsAnatomy, Physio-
logy, Pathology andTherapeutics are allerroneous. The
suggestion, cruel and baseless asitis,originally emanated
from aneminent Indian physician who hasearned anun-
xvi INTRODUCTION.
enviable reputation bywriting aTreatise onHindu Materia
Medica Hesays—“It(theAyurvedic system), isbuiit not
somuch upon experiment and observation asupon an
erroneous system ofPathology andTherapeutics.’Butsuch
auexpression would notstand the light ofday. Indeed
none buttheancient Hindu sages didsetahigh value on
experiment andobservation, andwhere they didnotclaim
some occult knowledge orintuition, itisupon these twothat
theymainly based alltheirknowledge.
The Materia Medica oftheHindus isreally amarvel.
Itsdescription oftheproperties ofdrugs belonging tothe
animal, vegetable andmineral kingdoms, andofthe articles
offood essential tothemaintenance ofhealth andstrength,
itsselection ofthespecific dietaries andelimination ofwhat
areprohibited inparticular ailments areevery daybeing
found correct. TheEuropean preparations ofIndian drugs
and diets arecorroborative evidence thereof. The theory
adopted bytheancient Hindus asthebasis oftheir investiga-
tion ISthat every substance, whether regitable oranimal,
possesses fiveproperties namely,—Rasa, Guna, Viryya, Vipaka
andFrabhdva which lenses alone cannot reveal, northebody's
eye after observation andexperiment made upon ratsand
rabbits. And those whohave opportunities ofstudying and
practising both theEastern andWestern Medical Science
assert thattheancient Medical Science oftheHindus once
reached thehighest standard ofexcellence and perfection in
Materia Medica, Therapeutics andHygiene andwassimply
unrivalled andunapproachable, asitblended Philosophy with
Science—themind’s eyewith thebody’s eye.
Adispassionate examination ofthese facts (andsuch as
canbemultiplied toanyextent), willconvince animpartial
reader thatAyurveda, aswefind itdescribed inCharaka
Samhita andSusrula Samhita, ifapproached inaspirit of
fairness and enquiry, might reveal thegerms ofnotafew
ofthemarvellous achievement ofthepresent ageinthe

student avast scope and varied materials forcompariston
betsreen theEastern andtheWestern systems, andrender
matenal help inimproving upon theone withtheaidof
theother, and thistothebenefit ofthesuffering humanity at

Lastly itisourprayer, that ifWestern Medical Science
wasever anywise, directly orindirectly, benefited bythe
ancient Medical Science oftheHindus, itisbutmeet
and fairthattheformer should come forward torender all
possible aidtoherparent Science, andthatasitisalmost

exuding pusand blood, attended with lossofstiength
(PrAna) and flesh, curvature ofthefingers, and eruptions,
ofnodules, should beregarded asincurable,while a
case ofone year's standing admits only ofpalliative
measures 44.
Theenraged oragitated VAyu, while coursing swiftly
through theDhamanis (nerves) ofthebody, shakes itin
quick succession, and adisease, (exhibiting such

symptoms asshaking orconvulsive jerks), isoriginated
which iscalled Akshepaka" (spasms, convulsions) The
foim ofthedisease, inwhich thepatient falls tothe

without convulsions) Thei^giavatcd oragitated Vdyu,
chaiged withanabnormal quantity ofKaphain, some-
times affects and stuffs theentire nciwous system, and
gives usetoaform ofdisease, which iscalled Dand^-

hasdenominated asDandd-patduakh which, c\hibils such S}niploms as

Themovements oftheeyesbecome impossible, which
become fixed intheir sockets,thejaw-bones become

thesame enraged Vdyu, centicd orlodged inligaments
which traverse theposterior sideofthebodj% attracts
them violently, thebody isnatuially bent backward
The patient expciionccs asoit ofbreaking pain at
the chest, waist and thighs, (which aieultimately
broken). Thedisease iscalled Vahirtiy^ma, andshould

Four types ofAkshepaka aieusually lecognised
inpractice such as,the (l)one incidental tothe

(traumatic).
12 THESHSHRUTA SAMHITA.IChap. I.
Thedisease, inwhich theextremely agitated VAyu
affects thenerve chains (Dhamanis) which spread either
inthe leftorintheright sideofthebody, whether in
theupwaid, downward, oilateral direction, making them
laxand vigourless, andinwhich thejoints oftheother
sideofthebodybecome useless andinoperative, iscalled
Fakshaighsita (Hemiplegia) byeminent physicians.
The patient, thewhole orhalf ofwhose body has
become (almost) inoperative and lost allsensibilitj', but
who retains hisconsciousness solong asthere remains
theleast vestige ofvitality intheaffected part,suddenly
fallsdown andexpires. 53—54.
Prognosis; —Acase ofPakshaghSta (Hemi-
plegia), brought about through thesingle action ofthe
enraged oragitated VAyu ofthebody, canbecured
onlywith thegreatest careand difficulty Acase of
thesame disease, engendered bytheaggravated VAyu
111conjunction with thederanged Pittam orKapham,
proves amenable tomedicine (Sddhya). Itbecomes in-
curable when caused through thewaste oftheroot prin-
ciples (Dhatu) ofthebody 55.
Apatantrapkah (Convulsions) —The VAyu,
aggravated (by its specifically exciting factors and
principles) anddislodged from itsnatural scat orrecep-
tacle inthebody inconsequence thereof, courses upwards
andfindslodgment intheunions ofthehead, heart and
temples Itpiesses upon those partsandgives riseto
convulsive movements ofhands and legs,orattimes
bends themdown.
Symploins :—The patient lieswith hiseyes
closely shut, orstares with asort offixed orvacant
gaze, theeyes remaining fixed orimmovable The
patient loses allperception, andgroans. Respiration
becomes difficult, orsymptoms oftemporary asphyxia

Thedisease admits ofbeing divided intofour scveial
types, such astheVdtaja, thePittaja, theKaphaja and
theSukraja (Seminal) concretions Anexuberance or
preponderance ofthederanged Kapham should beunder-
stood astheunderlying cause ofallinvasions ofthis
disease 2.
General aetiology TheKaphah ofaman,
who neglects tocleanse (Sams'odhana) the internal
channels ofhisoiganism, 01isinthehabit oftaking
unwholesome food, enraged and aggiavatcd byitsown
exciting causes, isearned into theurinary bladdei.
Here itbecomes saturated with theinino, andgives rise
totheformation ofconcretions orgiavcls initscavity. 3,
Premonitory Symptoms;— An aching
pain inthebladder, withanon-relish forfood, difficulty
murination, anexcruciating pain inthescrotum, penis,
andtheneck ofthebladder, febrile symptoms, physical
lassitude, andagoat-like smell intheurine arcthe
symptoms, which indicate theformation ofgravel in
thebladder 4
Metrical Text Thederanged Doshas involv-
edinaparticular case respectively impart their specific
colour totheurine, anddetermine thecharacter ofthe
accompanying pain. The urine becomes thick, tuibid,
andvitiated withtheaction oftheaggravated Doshas,
andmicturition becomes extremely painful 5.

The^leshmElS'niari:— Stone orgravel, ori-
ginated through theaction ofthederanged Kapham,
saturated withanexcessive quantity ofthatDosha by
the constant ingestion ofphlegm-generating (Slcsh-
mala) substances, increases insizeattheloucrorifice of
thebladder andultimately obstructs thepassage ofthe
urine Thepiessuie and iccoil ofthatincarcerated fluid
onthewalls oftheuiinary baddei gives risetoakind of
ciushing, bursting, pricking pain inthat organ, which
•becomes coldand heai'y.AKapha-origined stone or

The V^tsis'ntiarl :—The deianged Kapham
(mucus’) inordinately satuiated with thebodily Vdyu,
acquires hardness andgains indimensions, and these
lying atthemouth ofthebladder obstructs thepassage
oftheurine The incarcerated fluid causes extieme
pain intheoigan. Thepatient constantly under seveie
pam gnashes histeeth orpresses hisumbilical legion,
orrubs hispenis, orfingers hisrectum (Pdyu) and
loudly screams Aburning sensation isexperienced
inthepenis, and uiination, belching anddefecation
become difficult andpainful' Theconcretions inthis
type ofAs'mari aiefound tobeofadusky colour,
rough, uneven inshape, hard, facetted andnodular like

called Sidhma (Maculae atrophica:). Thisform isgenerally
found torestrict itself totheupper part ofthebody.

malady attended with pain, burning and itching, and
restricting itself solely tothelower cxticmitics, iscalled
Vip^diktf Thetype inwhich theeruptions exude (a
kind ofslimy secretion) andwhich arc circular, thick,
excessively itching, glossy andblack-coloured iscalled
Kitima (Keloid tumours). Small pustules orpimples

Theforms knorvn asSthuldrushka, Sidhraa, RakasS,

Kil^Satn:—The disease known asKildsam is
butanother form ofKushtham. Itmaybedivided into
three types according asitisbrought about thiough
theaction ofthederanged Vdyu, Pittara orKapham.
The difference between Kildsam andKushtham isthat
theformer confines itself onlytotheTvaka (theskin)and
ismarked bytheabsence ofany secietion.’’ Acaseof
Kildsam caused bytheaction ofthederanged Vdyu is
circular, vermilion-coloured andrough tothetouch. The
affected partwhen rubbed peals offscales ofmorbid skin.
Acase ofKildsam, duetotheaction ofthederanged
Pittam, ismarked byeiuptions, resembling thepetals
ofalotus flower (inshape andcolour), and areattended
with anextremely burning sensation Inthetype
originated through theaction ofthederanged Kapham,
theaffected part (skin) assumes aglossy, white coloui,
becomes thick and ismaiked byanitching sensation
Theform inwhich theeruptions orpatches extend and
become confluent, imading even the soles ofthe feet,

theoutcome ofabum (cicatrix) should belikewise con-
sidered asincurable. 12.
Apreponderance ofthederanged Vdyu inacaseof
Kushtham (lepiosy) isindicated byacontraction ofthe
skin, local anaesthesia, acopious flow ofperspiration,
swelling, andpieicing orcutting pain intheaffected part,
together withadeformity ofthelimbs andhoarseness
Similarly, anexcess ofthederanged Pittam inacase of
Kushtham, should bepiesumed from thesuppuration of
theaffected pait,from thebreaking ofthe local skin,
from the falling offofthe fingers, from thesinking of
thenoseand ears,from theredness oftheeyesandfrom
thegeimination ofparasites intheincidental ulcer An
excessive action ofthederanged Kapham, inacase of
Kushtham, givesusetoitching, discolouring andswelling
ofthe affected partwhich becomes heavy andexudes
thecharacteristic secretion Thetypes, Pundarika and
KAkanam, which areduetothegerminal defect of
thepatient, areincurable, inasmuch asthey involve
(according toDallana) theconceited action ofthe
three simultaneously deranged Doshas from thevery
outset. 13

Classification :—^This disease maybedivided
intoeight different types, ofwhich four arcproduced
bytheseveral actions ofthethree deranged Doslias of

swing orhammock, indigestion, and useofmedicines
which induce thelabour painorbung about abortions,
andsuch likecauses tend toexpel thefretus fiom its
fixture. These causes tend tosever thechild fiom the
uterine wallwith itsplacental attachment owing toa

Definition- —The faetus, thus severed and
dislodged from itsseat, excites peristalsis notonly in
the uterus, butinduces asort ofconstant, spasmodic
contraction oftheintestinal cavities (Koshthas), pio-
ducing pain intheliver, spleen, etc.TheApdna Vdyu,

ofherabdomen, pioduces any ofthefollowing symp-
toms, vizasort ofspasmodic painmthe sides, or

and destroys the faetus, ifimmatute, attended with
bleeding. Incase the faetus continues todevelop
and isbrought inaninverted posture attheentrance
tothevaginal canal, and isimpacted atthat place,
or iftheApdna Vdyu gets disoidered and conse-
quently cannot help theexpulsion ofthesame, such
anobstructed faetus iscalledHndha garbhah. 3.
Classification andSymptoms:- Cases
ofMudha-garbha may beroughly divided into four
different classes such as,theKtlak, thePratikkm ah,
the Vijakah andthePatighah, The sort offalse
presentation inwhich thechild comes with itshands,
legsandhead turned Upward andwith itsback firmly
obstructed attheentrance tothevagina, likeastakd
orakila, iscalled Kilah. The sortofpresentation, in
which the hands, feetand head ofthechildcome
out,with itsbody impacted attheentrance tothe
vagina, iscalled Frathikhurah Thetype inwhich only
asingle hand and thehead ofthechild come out
(with the rest ofitsbody obstructed atthesame
place), iscalled theVijakah. Thetype inwhich the
child remains obstructing thehead ofthepassagem
ahoiizontal position, likeabolt, iscalled theParighah.
Certain authorities aver that, these aietheonly four
kinds ofMudhagarbha. Butwecannotsubscribe to
theopinion (which recognises only foui kinds offalse
presentations), inasmuch asthederanged Vdyu (ApAna)
canpresent the faetus invarious different postures
atthehead ofthevaginal canal Sometimes, thetwo
thighs ofthechild are firstpiesented, andsometimes it
comes with asingle legflexed up Sometimes the
child comes with itsbody, bent double, andthighs
drawn up,sothatonly breech isobliquely presented.
Sometimes the child ispresented, impacted atthebead

ofthepassage with itschest, orsides, orback. Some-
times thechild ispresented with itsaimaround itshead,
resting onthe side, and thehand coming out first.
Sometimes onlythe tn’ohands aie fiistpresented, the
head leaning ononeside,sometimes thetwohands, legs
andthehead ofthe child, thelest ofthebody being
impacted attheexitinadoubled upposture. Some-
times oneleg ispresented, theother thigh being impacted
atthepassage (Pdyu). Ihave briefly described these
eight sorts ofpresentation ofwhich the lasttwo
areinemediable The rest should begiven upas
hopeless ifthese areattended with thefollowing compli-
cations VIS.,deranged sense-perception ofthemother,
convulsions, displacement orcontraction oftherepro-
ductive organ (yoni) apeculiar pain liketheafter-pain of
child birth, cough, difficult lespiration, orveitigo. 4,

(abscess etc)tohisdisciple, Sus'ruta 3
Definition and classification The
extremely deranged and aggravated Vayu, Pittam
andKapham, resoiting tothebone and vitiating
theTvaka(skin),blood, flesh, and fatofaperson
(with their own specific properties), gradually give
rise toadeep-seated, painful, tound orextended
swelling which iscalled Vidradhi bythewise. The
disease admits ofbeing divided into sixtypes such as
theVataja type, thePittaja type, theKapfiaja type,
theS&nnipahka type, theKshataja type (traumatic),
andtheAsttja tnhich hasitsseat inthevitiated blood).
Nowweshall describe their specific symptoms. 3-4,
TheV^taja Type ;—This abscess assumes a
black Orveimilion colour, isfeltrough tothetouch and
ischaracterised byasortofexcruciating pain. The
growth andsuppuration oftheabscess arebrought
about inavariety offorms (owing tothevariable
andirregular action ofthederanged VAyu inolved in
these cases). 5.
The Pl'ttaja Type :—This abscess assumes a
blackish yellow colour 01onelikethatofaripeAudum-
vara fimt. Itisattended with fevei and aburning
sensation, and isofrapid giowth andsuppuration. 6.
62 NIDANA sthanam. Chap. IX]
TheKaphaja Type This abscess isshaped
likeanIndian saucer (s'aidva) andseems cold tothe
touch Itassumes alightyellow coloui and ischaractei-
isedbynumbness, itching and little pain. Thegiowth
andsuppuiation ofthisabscess isvery slow. The
secietions fromaVdtaja abscess aic thin, those from
aPittaja type aieyellow, while theexudations from a
Kaphaja abscess arcwhite. 7
The Ssinnipsitika Type:— Anabscess of
theSdnnipdtika tj'pe isofvaiicd coloui, and isattended
withavaried sort ofpain (sucking, drawing, turning
etc)andexudes secietions ofvarious colours (white,
yellow, etc.) Itislittle laiscd orelevated atitstop,
large and irregular initsshape anddocsnotuniformly
suppurate inallitsparts S,
Agantuja orKshataja Type The local
orinherent heat ofanulcer, (caused byablow’ ora
dirt) inaperson, addicted tounw’holcsome regimen, is
augmented andconducted bythederanged Vdyu and
vitiates theblood andPittara, thusgiving risetoakind
ofabscess which isknown astheAgantuja Vidradhi
(traumatic abscess] Symptoms ofthePittaja type like-
wisemark thistype ofabscess and fever, thirst anda
burning sensation attend itfrom theverybeginning. 9.
TheRaktaja Type:—This abscess assumes
ablack ortawny colour, covered withalargenumber
ofblack vesicles, and fever andanintolerable burning
andpain attended with allthesymptoms peculiar to
thePittaja type,mark thepresent form ofthe disease.
Itiscalled Raktaja Vidradhi Ofexternal Vidradhis
orabscesses, those oftheS&nnipdtika type should be
regarded asincurable. 10—ii.
Antara-Vidradlhi :—Now W’Cshall describe
thecharacteristic features ofinternal abscesses (Antaia-
[Chap. IX theSUSHRUTA SAMHITA. 63
Vidradhi). TheViyu, Pittam andKaphah ofthebody,
deranged through eating heavy, incompatible and in-
congenial (tothephysical temperament oftheeatei)
articles offood orofdry,puti idanddecomposed sub-
stances, orbyexcessive coition andfatiguing physical
exercise, orbyvoluntary repression ofany natural
urging ofthebody orthrov^h theeating offoodwhich
isfollowed byanacid reaction, eithei severally or
collectively give risetoatumour-hke (Gulma), raised,
orelevated abscess intheinterior oftheorganism, which
isoften felttobeshaped likeanant-hill. 12-13.
Localities :—They aregenerally found tobe
seated atthemouth (neck) ofthebladder, orabout the
umbilicus, orinthe sides, orintheKukshi (inguinal
r^ions), orontheVrikkas, orontheliver, orinthe
heart, orontheKloma, oronthespleen, orinthe
rectum Their general characteiistics areidentical with
those oftheseveral types ofexternal abscess. The
symptoms oftheir suppurated orunsuppurated stages
should bedetermined inthe light ofthechapter on
Amapakvaishanyiam (ChXVII Sutra) 14-15.
Their specific symptoms :-Now hear
medescribe thesymptoms which specifically mark these
internal abscesses according totheir seats inthediffer-
entlegions oftheoiganism. Anabscess appearing
intherectum. (Guda) ismarked bythesuppression
oftheflatus (Vital Seatedmthebladder, itgives rise
todifficulty ofurination and scantiness ofurine
Appearing about theumbilicus itproduces adistressing

tines. Sealed ineither ofthesides(Kukshi) ittends to

ing intheinguinal region itgives rise toanextieme

charactciistic indications arc thiist and difficult
breathing (DR—hic-cough) wheieas asortofunquen-
chable thirst isthesj^mptom mhichmarks itsscaton
theKloma. 16-17
Prog’ll OSiS :—Anabscess appearing onany
vital part(Marma) ofthe organism, whether large
orsmall insize,suppurated orunsuppurated, should be
deemed asextremely hard tocure. Discharge froman
abscess formed inthelegion oftheorganism above the
umbilicus and(spontaneously bursting), will flow'out
through themouth whereas similar secretions fromdown
theumbilical region of[theabdomen), naturally find
anoutlet through thefissure oftheanus The case
inwhich the secretions (pus etc) find adown-
w'ard channel andoutletmay end inrccoscry ofthe
patient whereas theoneinwhich tliesecretions takean
upward course invariably proves fatal.An incision
made bysurgeon from theoutside intoaninternal
abscess, other than theone situated ontheheart, oron
thebladdei orontheumbilicus may occasionally, prove
successful, buttheone,seated onany ofthepicccding
vulnerable visceias (heart, bladder etc.)ofthebodyand
surgically opened invariably ends indeath 1S-19

hyper-pyrexia (Dihajvaia) should beconsidered as
having had itsorigin tothe vitiated blood (Raktaja

which appears intheKukshi (inthe iliac region) of
asafely delivered woman owing tothepresence ofthe
unexpelled blood-clots inthose regions after child-
birth, should bealsodiagnosed asacase ofRaktaja
abscess The unexpclled blood iscalled Makkalla.

Differentiating diagnosis ofGulma
andVidradhi* :—^Now tshall discuss thefeatures
which distinguish aGulma (internal tumour) fioma
Vidradhi (internal abscess). Itmaybeasked, how is
itthatGulma, (internal tumour) though caused by,
andinvoU ingtheco-operation ofthes.imc deranged

thelatter (Vidradhi) doesruntosuppuration ’22— 23.
Theanswer isthataGulma (internal tumour), though
caused bythesame deranged Doshas asaVidradhi
(internal abscess), docs not resort toanyderanged
oiganic matter, such asflesh, blood, etc., while, on'the
contrary, inacase ofVidradhi, thediseased fleshand

Hence, 'itisthataGulma (internal tumour) does not
suppurate atallSuppuration sets ininanabscess only
because itlargely contains flesh andblood unlike a
Gulma (internal tumour) which isnotformed ofany
such organic matter, anddepends onlyontheaggravated
Doshas giving biith to it.Hence, aGulma doesnot
suppurate atall.24
Incurable Types :—Acase ofaninternal
abscess suppurating about the heait, bladder or
umbilicus aswell asoneoftheTridosha type(appearing
inany part oftheorganism) should begiven upasin-
curable. The abscess inwhich themaiiow suppuiates
generally) becomes fatal The suppurating process in
aninternal abscess, which geneially affects theunder-
lying bone, ISsometimes found toaffect themarrow
Thesuppurated marrow, failing tofindanoutlet on
account ofthecompactness ofthelocal fieshandbone,
produces asort ofburning sensation inthe locality
which consumes thebody likeablazing fileThe
disease confined tothebone, like apiercing dirt;
torments thepatient foraconsideiable length oftime.
Anincision (made intotheaffected bone) isfollowed
bythesecretion ofafat-Iike, glossy, white, coldand
thick pus. Men, learned intheknowledge ofthe
Medicinal Sdstras, designate such anabscess asan
Asthighdta-Vidradhi (abscess ofthe bone) which
involves allthethree kinds ofderanged Doshas, and is
attended with various kinds ofpain which maik them
respectively. 25-26

Definition ofVisarpa Thederanged and
aggravated Doshas,'(Vayu, Pittam andKapham) having
recourse to,and affecting theTvaka (Skm), fleshand
blood, speedily give risetoasortofshifting, elevated
swelling (Sotha) marked bythechaiactcristic symptoms
ofanyofthem involved inthecase.This swelling tends
toextend allover thebody. The disease iscalled
Visarpa from thefactofitsextending orswiftly shifting
character (Skr. srip—togo,toextend) 2.
TheVdtaja Type :—Theswelling (^otha) is
softandrough andassumes ablack colour attended with
anaching pain inthelimbs andacutting orpiercing
pain (intheaffected local it}'). Itisfurther marked by
(alltheusual) symptoms oftheVitika feverAcase of

because theimmediately prior cause ofthehuman

TheScience ofmedicine does notlaydown that the
self-conscious Selves (Kshetiajna) areallpeivading, but
onthecontraiy itasserts thatthey arerealand eternal

The existence ofthese self-conscious entities canbe
ascertained dulybyinference inasmuch asthey are
extremely subtle intheir essence The self-conscious

eternally subject totheprocess ofbeing evolved out
intoafinite, oiganic individual through thedynamics

corioborated byadictum oftheSiuti which holds that
Purusha (individual) isnothing butacombination of
aself-conscious selfandthefivekinds ofmatter (Mahi-

individual, which iscalled Individual ofaction tKarma-

ofmedicine.* 16—17
*Here tiesthedifference between SSinkhya andAyurveda. While the
former discourses oninmaterial character ofthesoul, the latter com*

thespiiiiual within thematerial organism iseffected.
Hence Sus'ruta’s Physiology, likethatofChataka, isinthe strictest
sense oftheword molecular and hisscience oflife isanattempt at
explanation ofconsciousness from thematenalisUc standpoint, which
agrees with theviews ofmodern western science. Intellect according to
Sus'ruta ismaterial andbelongs tothesame category which theSdnkbya

wateiy pimciple ofthebody atthetimeofconception,
selves tomake thechild afaitcomplexioned one
(Gauia-vaina),mixed with alaigc quantity ofthe
eaith principle (Kshiti) ofthebody, itmakes thechild a
daik complexioned one (Krishna-vaina). Incombi-
nation with alaige quantity ofearth and ethereal
principles oftheoiganism, itimparts adusky (Krishna-

similai combination ofwatery and ethereal principles
serves tomake the childdusky yellow (Gaura-s'yama).
Otheis onthecontiaiy avei thatthecomplexion ofthe
child isdetermined bythecolours ofthefood taken

Achild isborn blind inthe failure ofthe fierj'
principle (Teja-dh 4tu)oftheoiganism inleaching the
legion ofits stillundeveloped eyes (part—where the
eyeswould be);soalsoapencil ation bythesame

Deveiopment oftheFoetus:— Inthefirst

formed (inthewomb); themolecules oftheprimary

matter) indicates themale-sex (oftheembryo). An
elongated-like shape ofthematter denotes that the
feetus belong totheopposite sex;whcieas itstumour-
likeshape (like a^ilmali-bud) predicts theabsence of
anysex (*e.ahermaphrodite). Inthethird month,

(ofthebody oftheembryo) become more potent and
the feetus isendowed with consciousness owing tothe
formation ofviscus oftheheart. Asheart isthescat
ofconsciousness, soastheheart becomes potent, itis
endowed withconsciousness andhence itexpresses its
desire forthings oftaste, smell etc (through the
longings ofitsmother) Thecncicnte iscalled double-
hearted (Danhrida) atthe time, whose wishes and
desires—notbeing honoured and gratified—leadtothe
birth ofaparalysed, hump-backed, crooked-armed,
lame, dwarfed, defect-eyed, andablind child. Hence
thedesires ofthecncicnte should begratified, which
would ensure thebirth ofastrong, vigorous and long-
lived son. 14.
Memorable Verses :~A physician should
cause thelongings ofapregnant woman (Danlirida)
tobogratified inasmuch assuch gratifications would
alleviate thediscomforts ofgestation;herdesires being
fulfilled ensure the birth ofastrong, long-lived, and
virtuous son.Anon-fulfilment ofherdesires during
pregnancy, proves injurious both toherchild andher
ow'nself. Anon-gratification ofany sensual enjoy-
mentbyitsmother iDauhrida) during gestation tends
topainfully affect theparticular sense-organ ofthe
child.
Longing'S and itseffects during
pregnancy;—Ancncicnte longing foraroyal

Firm unions ofMinsa (muscles), ^ira (veins), Sniyu

(orvital parts ofthebody) which naturally and specifi-
cally form theseats oflife(Prina), andhence ahurtto

TheMarmas belonging totheSadya-Prinahara group

tolife(intheevent ofbeing anyway hurt);while
those belonging totheKAldntara-Prdnahara group arc

asthefiery virtues areenfeebled easily andthecooling
virtues take aconsiderable time inbeing so,the

Buttheforegoing theory isnotasound one, inas-
much asblood ISfound toexude from aninjured joint
which would beanimpossibility intheabsence ofany
vein, ligament (Snayu) andmuscle being intimately
connected with it.Hence everyMarma should be
understood asajunction ormeeting place ofthefive
organic principles ofligaments, veins, muscles, bones
andjoints 24-25
Metrical text;— This isfmthei corroborated
bythefactthatthefour classes of^irdorvessels (which
respectively carry theViyu, Pitta,Kapha andtheblood)
arefound toenter into theMarmas foithepurpose
ofkeeping ormaintaining themoisture ofthe local
ligaments (Snayu), bones, muscles andjoints andthus
sustain theotganism.f The Vdyu, aggravated byan
injury toaMarma, blocks up(those four classes of
vessels) intheir entire course throughout theorganism
andgives risetogreat painwhich extends allover the
body. Alltheinternal mechanism ofaman (ofwhich a
Marma hasbeen pierced intowithashaft orwithany

AMarma oftheSadyah-Pr^nahara type being
perforated atitsedge brings ondeath atalater time
(within seven days), whereas adeformity oftheorgan
follows from thepiercing ofaKdlintara-M 4raka“*
Marma attheside(instead ofinthecentre). Similarly,
anexcruciating painanddistressful after-effects mark a
similar perforation ofaMarma oftheVis'alyaghna'f

duces anexcruciating pain (instead ofasharp one) in
theevent ofitsbeing pierced atthefringe. 30
Aninjured Marma oftheSadyah-Pidnahara type
terminates indeath within seven daysoftheinjury,
whileoneoftheKdldntara type, within afortnight ora

(Dliamani-Vy^karana-^^riram). r.
There arctwenty-four Dhamanics (ducts) inall,and
allofthem have their origins inthenaval region
(which includes thewhole abdominal regioni"). Several
authorities assert thatnoarbitrary distinctions should
bemade among theSiras (veins!, Dhamanis (arteries),
andtheSrotas, (.channels), since Dhamanis and Srotas
arcbutdifferent modifications ofone original kind

Butowing totheir adjacent positions, theexistence

oneness oftheir character, similarity oftheir functions,
and theminute nature oftheir shape, theyappear to

Dhamanis perform theaforc-said functions. Now I
shall describe the specific functions (r.e,nature, office,
andsituations, etc.,) ofthelatcial-coursing Dhamanis7.
Functions ofthelateral-coursing
Dhamanis: —-The four lateral-coursing Dhamanis,
gradually ramifying themselves into hundreds and
thousands ofbranches, simply baffle counting. The
net-work ofthese Dhamanis spreads over thewhole
orgnism andmaintain itsintegrity. Their exterior
orifices areattached totheroots ofhairs (poios ofthe
skin) through which theyconvey theperspiration and
theRasa (serum), thussupplying thebody, both inter-
nally and externally, svith thesoothing nutritions
(moisture ofhealthy lymph-chyle). The effects and
potencies ofthe articles ofanointment, sprinkling,
immersion, and plasters, enter through these orifices
intotheinternal organism through theagency ofthe
heat inthe skin, and sensations ofapleasant or,
painful contact areexperienced through their instru-
mentality Thuswehave finished describing thefour
lateral-coursing Dhamanis with their ramifications
throughout thewhole organism. 8.
Memorable Verses TheDhamanis have
got pores intheii sides through which they carrj'
theRasa (lymph-chyle) throughout theorganism, like
thefilaments and fibres ofwater-lily and lotus. Thc=e
Dhamanis furnish theself-consqious Ego, confined in

elements) atthetime ofdeath 9—10.
Nowweshall describe thesymptoms produced bya
Srota (duct 01channel) pierced atitsroot orstarting
point. The ducts orchannels respectively conveying
the life,thefood, thewater, (the organic principle of)
theRasa (serum), theblood, themuscles, the fat,
the urine, the stool, the semen, and the cata-
menial blood, naturally failwithin thescope of
Surgery (^alya-tantra) Several authorities assert that
theSrotas (vessels) areinnumerable andperform
different functions intheir different aspects.
ThetwoSrotas (channels) ofPrina (bronchi) have
their roots intheheartandtheRasa-carrying Dhama-
nis(pulmonary arteries). Aninjury toanyofthese
Srotas (vessels) produces groaning, bending down of
thebody, loss ofconsciousness (Moha), illusion, and
shivering, ormay ultimately prove fatal The food-
carrying Srotas (vEsophagus) have their roots inthe
Amdsaya (stomach) andinthefood-canying Dhamanis
(intestines). Aninjury toorpiercing ofsuchaduct
(Srota), gives risetotympanites, colic pain, aversion to
food, vomiting, thirst, blindness ordarkness ofvision, or
mayevenendindeath. There aretwowater-carrying

ofthenursing andmanagement, etc, ofpr^nant
women from the da}' ofconception tillparturition
(Garbhini-VygCkarana-^irlram). i
General Rules :—Ancnciente, fiom the first
day ofconception, should always cherish aclear joy-
fulspirit inaclem body. Sheshould wear clean and
white garments, oinamcnts, &c.,engage herself inthe
doing ofpeace-giving andbenedictory ritesand live in
devotion tothegods, theBrahmins and her elders and
superiors. Sheshould nottouch norcome intocontact
with Unclean, deformed ormaimed persons, and should
forego theuseoffetid smelling things, avoid dreadful
sights andpainful oragitating sounds and theuseof
dry, stale and dirty food aswell asthat prepaied
overnight. Long and distant walks fromhome, resorts
tocremation-grounds ortoasolitary retreat, ortoa
Chaitya’", andsitting under theshadow ofatreeshould
beabsolutely forbidden (toherduring theperiod of
gestation) Indulgence inangei, flight orother agita-
tingemotions ofthemind should bedeemed injurious.
Tocarry aheavyload, totalk inaloud voice and
allother things which might occasion injury tothe
foetus, (sexpal intercourse, &c)should Tjerefrained from.
Thepiactice ofconstant anointment and thecleansing
ofthebody, &c.,(with Amalaki, Haridrd, etc.—lit. cos-
metics) should begiven up. Allfatiguing exercises
should bediscontinued andtherules laiddown forthe

guidance ofawoman inhermenses should beslriclly
adheted to.The couch andthebedofapicgnant
woman should helow, softandguarded onallsidesby
anumber ofsoft pillo\^ sorcushions. The food should
beamply sweet, palatable (Hridya),* well-cooked, pre
pared with appetising drugs andabounding influid
substances. These lulcs should befollowed up till
deliverj’. 2.
Special regimen during titeperiod
ofGestation :—During the first three months of
pregnancy ancncientc should partake offoodabound-
ing insMcct, cooland fluid articles. Several medical
authorities recommend afoodmade ofShashtika rice
with milk, tobegi\cn toherspecially inthethhd
month ofgestation, withcuid inthe fourth, with milk
inthe fifthandwith clarified butter inthesixth
month ofpicgnancy. Food largely composed of
milkand buttci, aswell asrelishing (Hridya) food
with thesoup ofthe flesh oi (w'ild) animals
should begiven toher inthe fourth, food withmilk
and clarified butter inthe fifth, adequate quantity
ofclarified butter prepared with (the decoction of)
^vadamsbtrd, orgruel (Ya\-dgu) inthesixth;andclarified
butter prepared w'lth (the decoction of)thePiithak-
pamyddi group inadequate quantities intheseventh
month ofgestation. Those help thefoetal development.
Forthepurpose ofrestoring theVdyu ofherbody
(neivous system) tothenormal course andcondition and
forthecleansing ofthebowels, theenciontc should be
given anAsthdpana (enema), composed of ,idecoc-

made upofemollient substances (fats;andsoup ofthe
flesh ofJAiigala animals (deei, etc.). Iftreated onthese
lines theenciente remains healthy and strong, and
paituiition becomes easyandunattended with eiils.
An enciente should bomade toenter the lying-in

Nowweshall discourse onthemedical treatment
ofthetwokinds ofinflamed ulcers(Dvivranlya

asthey areIdiopathic orTramnatic intheir origin
The firstgroup includes within itsboundary allulcers
thatarecaused through thevitiated condition ofthe
blood ortheseveral deranged conditions oftheVAyu,
Pitta andKapha, oraredue totheir concerted
action (Sannip&ta), while thesecond group embraces
thosewhich arecaused bydie bites ofmen, beasts,
birds, ferocious animals, reptiles orlizards, orbya
fall,pressure and blow, orby fire, alkali, poison, or
irritant drugs, orthrough injuries inflicted bypointed
wood, skeletal bones*, horns, discus, ariows, axes,
tridents, orKuntas (akind ofshovel', orsuch other
weapons. Although both these classes ofulcers possess
many features incommon, they have been grouped
undei twodistinct heads onaccount ofthediversity of
theii origin, thedifference inremedial measures tobe
adopted intheir treatment, and thevariation intheir

Dvivranlya. 2.
Inallcases oftraumatic ulcers, cooling measures

applied onthewounded locality for the adhesion
(Sandhdna) ofthelacciatcd parts, [and forthe pacifica-
tion, ie,restoration tonormal state, ofthe local blood
andVdyu aggravated through anobstruction oftheir
passage]. Hence arises thenecessity ofmaking the
two-fold classification ofulcers After that (aweek)
atiaumatic ulcer should betreated asanidiopathic
one (to allintents and purposes', inasmuch as itis
found tobeassociated w’ith deranged Vdyu, Pitta or
Kapha Hence atthat stage themedical treatment
ofboth theforms ofulcer is(practically) thesame. 3.
Inshort, ulcers arcfurther subdivided (particularly)
into fifteen groups, according tothepresence ofthe
morbific diathesis (deranged Vayu, Pitta Kapha
and blood therein), either severally orincombi-
nations asdescribed (before) intheChapter onVrana-
Pias'na (Sutra Sthdnam. Ch.XXI) Several author-
ities,byadding thesimple uncomplicated ulcers (un-
associated withany ofthemorbific principles ofthe
deranged Vdyu, Pitta, &c.) tothe list,hold thenumber
oftypes tobesixteen. (Practically they aie in-
numerable, according tothecombinations made ofthe

brown orvermilion colour andexudes athin, slimy
and cold secretion, largely attended with tension,
throbbing andasortofpricking and piercing pain (in
itsinside), which seems asifbeing expanded and
extended This type ofulcer does notextend much
and ischaracterised byacomplete destruction ofthe
tissue (flesh). ThePittaja ulcer israpid initsgrowth.
Itassumes abluish yello.v colour, exudes ahotsecretion
resembling thewashings ofKims'uka flowers, and is
attended withburning, suppuration and redness, being
surrounded with eruptions ofsmall yellow-coloured
pustules TheKaphaja ulcer isfound tobeextended

irresistible itching seniatioa. Itisthick andcompact

with the medical treatment ofIVIah£L"V£(ta«<
Vysfdhi. i.
Several authorities group the disease Vata-Rakta
under two different sub-heads, such assuperficial and
deep-seated Butsuchaclassification isarbitrary and
unscientific, inasmuch asthis disease first manifests
itselfonthesurface (layer oftheskin) likeKushtha and
gradually invades thedeeper tissues ofthebody. Hence
there areno(tivo)forms ofthisdisease. 1-2.
Causes ofV^ta-Rakta TheVdyu of
thebody isenraged orj^itated bysuch causes as
wrestling withamanofsuperior anduncommon physical
strength, etc.,while theblood isvitiated bysuch causes
asconstant over-eating ofedibles which are ofdifficult
digestion andheat-making intheir potency oringestion
offood before thedigestion oftheprevious meal. The
Vdyu thusenraged and agitated enters intotheblood-
carrying channels ofthebody andbeing obstructed
initspassage, becomes mixed with thevitiated blood.
Thederanged V4yu andtheblood thuscombine togive
risetoadisease characterised bythespecific symptoms
ofeach,which isknown asV^ta-Rakta The charac-
teristic pain,which atfirstconfines itself totheextre-
mities, gradually extends overthewhole body.
Premonitory symptoms ofV^ta-
Rakta !—The disease isUshered inwith apricking
pain, aburning andanitching sensation (inthe affected
part), aswelling, roughness andnumbness (anresthesia)
ofthediseased locality, throbbing oftheveins, ligaments,

hand themedical treatment ofaVdta-Rakta-patient
whohasasyetnotlostmuch strength andmuscle, nor is
afflicted with thirst, fever, epileptic fits,dyspnoea, cough,
numbness (oftheaffected pait), aversion tofood, indi-
gestion, extension andcontraction ofthelimb, aswell
asofaperson who isstrong andtemperate inhisliving
andcan afford topayforthedietandother necessary
accessories ofthetreatement 5
Preliminary remedial measures In
the firststage ofthedisease theblood, having become
vitiated owing toitsbeing obstructed initscourse (by
theunusually agitatedV4yuinthesystem), should be
gradually andnotprofusely bled, except when thebody
would befound tohavebecome extremely dryortohave
lost itsnatural healthful glow orcomplexion through the
action oftheaggravated morbific principle (Vdyu), for
fearoffurther aggravating theViyu. Emetics, purga-

andwholesome totheheart (Hridya) NewGuggulu is
anaphrodisiac andaconstructive tonic. OldGuggulu

owing toitssharpness and heat-making potency
thatGuggulu tends toreduce theViyu and the
Kapha;itisitslaxativeness that destroys theMalas
(refuge deposits inthe Srotas) and thederanged
Pitta;itsaroma removes thebadodours ofthe
Koshtha;and itisitssubtle essence that impioves
theappetising faculty. Guggulu should betaken

taken withanadequate quantity ofcow’s urine, orwith

boiled ricewith soup, milk, orextract ofmeat after the
Guggulu hasbeen digested. Diseases such asinternal

Nowweshall discouise onthemedical treatment of
Ilasmonhoids (Arsas). i
The remedial measuies inhsemori holds may be
giouped under foursubheads,namely, theemployment of
(active) medicinal remedies, theapplication ofanalkali
(into theseatofthedisease), actual cauteiization (ofthe
polypii) andsurgical opeiation. Acase oflecent origin
involving theaction oftheDoshas toaslight degree and
uncomplicated withanygrave oidangerous symptom
andcomplication may prove amenable tomedicine
alone. Deep-seated polypii, which aicsofttothetouch
andmaikedly elevated andextended (extemal—D R),
should betreated with alkaline applications, while
those which aielough, film, thick andhard should be
cauterized with fire Polypii which areraised, exuding
and .slender attheloots should besuigically treated
Hoemorrhoids which aieheldamenable tomedicine and
aienotvisible (tothenaked eye)should betieated with
the help ofmedicines alone. Now, listen tothe
pioceduie tobeadopted inthetieatment ofAisas
which would require alkaline applications, acauteiiza-
tion, 01asuigical operation 2.
Application ofKsh^ras— Thebody of
thepatient suffering fiom haemoirhoids, intheeVent of

The extciioi oiifico oftheinstrument should beclosed

Then after having cleansed thepolypus, afresh

Polypii, having theii origin inthederanged Vrfyu and

symptoms as,lestoration ofthebodily Vdyu toits
noimal condition, relish forfood, keenness oftheappe-
tite,lightness ofthebodyandimprovement instrength,
complexion and pleasure. An over-cauterized (Ati-
dagdha) polypus gives rise tosuch symptoms as,
cracking oftheregion oftheanus, aburning sensation
(intheaffected locality), fainting, fever, thirst, and
prrfuse hmmoiihage (from therectum), andconsequent
complications,whileaninsufficiently cauteiized (Hina-

Fistuia-in-ano, etc.,(Bhagandara). I.
Thedisease admits ofbeing divided into fivedifferent
gioups, ofwhich thetwo,known asS'ambukdvarta and
S'alyaja (traumatic!, should beregarded asincurable,
andth^lestasextremely difficult tocure. 2.
TheGeneral Treatment; —^The eleven*
kinds ofremedial measures commencing with Apatar-
panauptopurgatives (asdescribed under thetreatment
ofDvi-vrana) should beemployed aslong asany
fistular ulcer would remain inaninsuppurated stage
Thepatient should besoothed bytheapplication of
medicated oil, etc.,andhisbody should befomented by
immersing him inareceptacle ofwarm water, etcas
soon assuppuration would setin(andeven after the
ulcer had burst). Then having laidhimonabed
andbound hishands andthighs with straps asdes-
cribed under thetreatment ofHmmorrhoid, thesurgeon
should examine closely astowhere themouth ofthe
fistula isdirected, outward orinward, and whether
theulcer itself issituated, upward ordownward. Then
thewhole cavity orreceptacle ofpus (sinus) should
beraised upandscraped outwithanEshani (indicator
orprobe). Inacaseofinter-moutbed fistula, thepatient
should besecured with straps (asbefore described)
andasked tostrain drwn Anincision should then
bemadebyfirstdirecting theindicator when itsmouth
would become visible from theoutside.Cauterization

with fireoranalkali isageneral remedial measure which
mayberesorted toinallthetypes ofthisdisease 3-4.
Specific Measures— nn.Texts: -incases
ofthe^ataponaka type ailthesmall Yianas about
theanusshould befirstincisioned andtheprincipal sinus
inthelocality should notbelooked after until these
small oneshadbeen healed upTheconnected abscesses
should berespectively incisioned ontheexternal side,
while theunconnected ones should notbeopened at
thesame time inorder that theymay notrun into
oneanother andbethusconverted intoawide-mouthed
ulcer. Theurineandthefsecal matter arefound ineach
case toflowoutofthecavity ofsuch awide-mouthed
ulcer;andaching pains inthelectum andarumbling
sound intheabdomen, duetotheaction oftheaggrav-
atedViyu, areexperienced. Such acase isenough
toconfound evenawell-read andexperienced physician.
Hence themouth ofafistula ofthe^ataponaka type
should notbeopened withabroad incision.
Forms ofIncision Anexpenenced surgeon
should know that theLdngalaka, Ardha-Lingalaka,
Sarvatobhadraka andtheGotirthaka forms ofincision
should bethedifferent shapes ofincision, inacaseof
amany-mouthed S'ataponaka. Anincision equal inits
twosides iscalled theXitfngalaka (curvilineal), while the
onewith oneatmlonger than theother isnamed the
Ardha-Lsingalaka. Anincision made intheregion of
theanus intheshape ofacross (crucial) andalittle
removed from thelaphe oftheperineum, iscalled the
Sarvatobhadraka bymen conversant with theshapes
ofsurgical incisions. Anincision madebyinserting the
knife inoneside iscalled theGotirthaka (longitudinal).
Allexuding (bleeding) channels intheaffected region
should becauterized with firebythesurgeon

Acase ofthe^ataponaka- type occurring ina
person oftimid disposition orofdelicate constitution, is
extremely difficult tocure Medicinal fomentations en-
dowed with thevirtue ofarresting secretion andalleviat-
ingpain, should bequickly applied (totheseat ofthe
disease). Fomentations with Kris'arA, orPayasa (por-
ridge), made with theaforesaid Svedaniya (diaphoretic)
drugs with adecoction ofthedrugs constituting the

that, the ulcer should bewetted with theMadhuka-o'^
andthelectum should bewashed with medicated oils
which would alleviate pain due totheaction ofthe
deranged and aggravated VAyu. The preceding
medicinal remedies tend tobring about theoutfloiv or

CHAPTERm
Nowweshall discourse onthemedical Ircatmcnl of
theabscesses oreruptions which mark thesequel ofa
caseofFramcha (Pramcha-Pidakef)*
The nine kinds ofabscesses (Fidakis), such as
^ardvikd, etc., have been described before. Ofsuch
abscesses those, appearing inastrong person but
small insiac, affecting (only) theTvak (skin) and the
flesh, soft tothetouch, slightly painful, easily suppura
tivcandafteratime bursting, arecurable 2.
Patients suffering fromPrameha and afflicted with
theabove kinds ofabscesses (Pidak.is) should be
treated (inthefollowing manner) Measures, such as
fastings (Apatarpana), etc., decoctions *(ofVata, etc.)
andtheurine ofashc-goat, should beemployed inthe
incubative stage ofthedisease The urine, pcispira-
tionand the^Icshmd (sputum, etc\soon acquire a
sweetish taste, iftheaforesaid preliminary measures
arcnotresorted toand ifthepatient goesonusing sweet
articles offood inutter disregard ofthe instructions,
thusdeveloping fully the specific indications ofPra-
mcha. Inthisstage thesystem ofthepatient should
becleansed (Sams'odhana) with both emetics and
purgatives Ifthedisease isnotchecked (even at
thisstage) with theaforesaid measures (emetics and
purgatives), theaggravated Doshas ofthebody goon
increasing inintensity andtend toaffect orvitiate the
fleshandtheblood andproduce aninflamatory swelling
ofthebody, orbring onother supervening distresses

Ifthese benotdone (atthis stage), thepus eats into

callyknown asMadbu-Maha (to allintents andpur-
poses Fomentation (ofanykind) isforbidden inthe
case ofapatient suffering fromMadhu-Meha, since it
might lead tothegradual emaciation ofhisfiamc by
drying uptheorganic fat(Idedas), which isusually
found toabound inhisorganism. Theaggravated Doshas
ofthebody failtomake anupward passage inthe

^il^jatu, itsorigfin andproperties
Akind ofgelatinous substance issecreted from thesides
ofthemountains when theyhavebecome heated bythe
raysofthesuninthemonths ofJyaishtha^and Ashddha.
This substance iswhat isknown astheSildjatu and it
cures alldistempers ofthebody.
The presence ofthesixkinds ofmetal, such astin,
lead, coppei, silver, goldandblack-iion, intheir essen-
tialform inthe substance (^ildjatu), may be
detected bytheir lespective smell andhence itis
known tothepeople bythename ofShad-Tom
(lit.—having six different oiigins) The taste of
this shellac-coloured substance has thesame taste
(Rasa) andpotency (Vitya) asthemetal towhose
essence itowes itsorigin. Itshould beunderstood that
astin,leadand iron, etc.,areprogressively more and
more efficacious, sothe-different varieties ofSilijatu, ori-
ginated from theessence oftin,lead, iron, etc.,arepro-
gressively more efficacious intheir application.
Allkinds of^ildjatu have abitter andpungent
taste with anastringent aftei-taste (Anu-rasa), are

making intheirpotency andpossessed ofabsorbing and

CHAPTER XIV.
Nowweshall discourse onthemedical treatment of
diopsy with anabnormal condition oftheabdomen
(Udara). i.
Oftheeight different types ofUdara, described be-
fore,those severally known astheVaddha-guda andthe
Parisrdvi should beunderstood asincutable, therestbeing
equally hard tocure.Hence themedical treatment ofall
cases ofUdara (abdominal dropsy) should beresorted to
without holding outanypositive hope ofrecoveiy. The
firstfoultypes ofthedisease (asmetioned inthe listof
enumeration), mayprove amenable tomedicine;butthe
restwould require Surgical treatment. Allthetypes of
thedisease, however, would, with theprogress oftime,
require asurgical operation, or(attaining anincurable
stage) theymayhave tobeabondned. 2,
Diet ofarticles forbidden Apatient,
afflicted withanattack ofUdara, should forego theuse
ofheavy (indigestible), oremollient fare, ofallkinds
ofmeats andofthose thatproduce astate ofextreme
dryness inthesystem, orproduce aslimy secretion from
thechannels (oftheDoshas andthevital principles) of
thebody, orgive risetoasortofdigestionaiy acid
reaction (acid transformation inthestomach) and re-
frainfrombathing andusing effusions. Meals consisting
ofwellcooked S'dh rice,barley, wheat, orNivAra seeds
should bethedaily dietofsuch apatient. 3
Treatment oftheVdtaja type :-in a
caseofVdtaja Udara, thebody ofthepatient should be
anointed with claiified buttei cooked with thedrugs of
theViddii’gandhddi growp, while theonecooked with

compound made ofacopious quantity ofoilof
Chiird seeds, mixed withadecoction ofthedrugs ofthe
Viddi i-gandhddi group, should beused asAsthdpana
andAnuv&sana measures. The ^idvaua TTpaniCha
(poultice) should beapplied totheabdomen. Milk
cooked with thedrugs oftheViddt i-gandhddi group,
orthesoup oftheflesh ofJAngala animals should be
given tothepatient with hismeal and theaflected
region should befrequently fomented. 4.
Treatment ofthePittaja Type In
acaseofPittaja Udara, thepatient should beanointed
with clarified butter cooked with thedrugs ofthe
Madhura (KdkolyAdi) group. Similarly, clarified butter
cooked withS'ydmd, TfiphaJd and Ttivrit should be
used aspurgatives andthedecoction ofthedrugs ofthe
Nyagrodkddi group, mixed withacopious quantity of
sugar, honey and clarified butter, should beused as
Anuv&sana andA'sthdpana measures Theabdomen
should bepoulticed withPdyasa (porridge prepared with

acaseofKaphaja Udara, thepatient should beanointed
with clarified butter, cooked with thedecoction ofthe
drugs ofthePtppalyddt group. Likewise, claiified
butter, cooked with themilky juice ofSnuhi plants,
should beused aspurgatives,and thedecoction ofthe
drugs oftheMwshkakddi group, withacopious quantily

domen. .The diet should consist of(boiled ricewell-
mixed with) Knlattha soup (Yusha), profusely seasoned
withpowdered Tnkaiu, orofPAyasa;andtheabdomen
should befrequently fomented. 6.
-Treatment ofDushyodara !—Inacase
ofDushyodara, thepatient should betreated without
giving anyhope ofapositive cure. Purgatives with
clarified buttei, cooked with the expressed juice of
theSaptald andS'amkhim, should befirstadministered
(continuously) forafortnight orqyen amonth;orclari-
fied butter, cooked with themilky juice oftheMahi-
wikslia, andwithwineandcow’s urine, should besimi-
larlyused asapurgative. AKalka madeupoftheroots
oftheAs'vamdraka, Gunjd andKdkddani mixed with
wine (Surd), should begiven after thebowels hadbegun
tomove freely. Asanalternative, aKrishna-Sarpa (black
lance-hooded cobra) should beeniaged tobiteasugarcane
and thispiece ofsugarcane should begiven tothepatient
tochew (andsuck),oithefruits ofcreepers (Valli-phala)

enceinte, such aslifting up,drawing down, changing of
postuies (veision), excision, incision, thecutting oflimbs
andsection, pressure, thestraightening andtheperforat-
ingoftheabdomen, could notbedone otherwise thanby
actual contact ofthehand, which may sometimes
prove fatal tothefoetus ortotheenciente Hence the
king should befiistinformed (assuccess inthese cases
isoften uncertain) and allacts should beperformed
withthegieatest caieandcoolness.
Wehave stated before that thefoetus isgenerally
presented incases ofdifficult labour ineight different
postures oifoims. Theobstruction ofthechild inthe
passage ofparturition (Garbha-Sanga) may beeffected
inthree different ways, oiving toitshead, shoulders or

tionofanyextraneous poison intothesystem). 2
Theil* causes :—TheDoshas (morbific prin-
ciples) become aggravated and give rise toswellings
(^opha’l ofthebody, bysuch causes, asbyundertaking
ajourney immediately afteiameal, orbytheuseof
Harita-sdkas (potherbs,cakes and salts ininordinate
quantities, orbytheexcessive useofacids byweak

onelephants, horses, camels, invehicles, etc,oron
persons onthepartofdyspeptic patients. 3.
Specific Symptoms:— Aswelling (S'opha)
oftheYs(t;aj£( type isvermilion orblack-coloured and
isattended with softness andapricking pain inthe
swelling which disappears atintervals Aswelling of
theFittaja typeassumes ablood-ied oryellow colour,
swiftly expands and isattended with aburning and

typeassumes awhite orgreyish colour, becomes hard,
cold tothetouch andglossy, isslow in itsgrowth, and
ISattended with itching, pain, etcAswelling ofthe
Sftnmpcitika type(due totheconcerted action ofallthe
three Doshas ofthebody) exhibits allthesymptoms
which specifically belong toeach ofthethree above-
said types. 4-7.
Symptoms ofVIshaja-Sopha r-'),
swelling (Sopha) which results from thecontact or
introduction ofa(weakened) chemical poison (6ara) with
orinto thebody, orfiom theuseofpolluted water,
orbybathing inafoulandstagnant pool ortank, orby
dusting thebody with thepowders ofsubstances
poisoned byanypoisonous animal, orfrom thecontact
with weeds andplants, which have become poisoned
bythe urine, faecal matter, orsemen ofpoisonous
animals, iscalled aVishaja swelling The swelling
issoft,pendent and persistent, expands rapidly and
moves gradually (from one partofthebody tothe
other) and isattended with aburning sensation and
suppuration. S.
Memorable Verse Theaggravated Doshas
ofthebody confined inthestomach (Amdsaya) give rise
toaswelling intheupper partofthebody Confined
intheintestines (Pakvas'aya;, theygive risetoaswelling
inthemiddle partofthebody. Ifthey areconfined
inthereceptacle ofthefoeces (Malds'aya), thelower part
ofthebody becomes swollen. The swelling 'extends
alloverthebody intheevent oftheir (Doshas) being
diffused throughout theorganism. 9.

occurring inthemiddle part (trunk) ofthebody or
extending allover itmay becured with difficulty as

explicit andspecific injunction tothat effect. 15.
Now we shall discuss thedegrees ofmedically
cooking aSneha (oilorGhrita) Mild (Mridn), middling
orintermediate (Madhyama) andhard(Zhara) arethe
three degrees which theboiling process undeigoes in
medically cooking aSneha Acooking issaid tobe
mild(MridU'Fdka) when the oil isfound todrop off
entirely from itsdrug-paste (Kalka) leaving itdiyand
sapless; whereas inanactofmiddle-cooking (Madhyama-
Pdka) thepaste would befound tohave become
pellucid and non-sticky likewax;acooking done
until thepaste (intheSneha) assumes alittle clear,
glossy, frothless, black colour istermed strong (Khara-
Pdka). ASneha cooked beyond thelast-named degree
iscalled aburnt Sneha.ASneha should, therefore, be
properly cooked Amildly cooked Sneha should be
administered infoodand drinks Amiddling-cooked

Memorable Verses !—The cooking ofa
Ghrita should beconsidered medically complete as
soon asthe froth and thesound would vanish and
thepccuhat smell, colour and taste ofpreparation
would bemanifest. The medically cooking ofanoil
resembles inallrespects that ofaGhrrta with this
exception that anabundance offroth appears onthe
surface oftheorlatthecompletion ofthecooking. 17,
Theprocess oftaking aSneha in-
ternally :—Now weshall describe theprocess of

three-quarter paits ofaday tobedigested, acts as
abodily emollient andshould bepiesciibed incases
ofextreme aggravation ofthebodily Doshas, while
thequantity which canonlybedigested inthecourse
ofanentire day (twelve hours) should beconsidered
efficacious inallaffections ofthebody anddoes not
produce physical lassitude, fainting fitsand delirious
conditions. Themeasuie oiquantity ofaSneha which

inthestomach, proves curative even incases of
ICushtha (cutaneous affections), insanity, poisoning
(effects ofpoison) andApasmdia (hysteric convulsions),
ascribed tothebaneful influences ofthemalignant

The evileffects ofOver-dosage :-A
patient should bemade totake asmuch oftheSneha
ashewould beable toeasily digest inasmuch asan
excessive ovei-dose may piove fatal. The patient
should bemade tovomit withdraughts ofhotwater
inacaseofoverdose 01abuse ofaSneha andinthe
event ofitscontinuing inanundigested orpartially

ful digestion, similar potions ofhotwater should

Metrical Texts :—^Emetic and purgative
lemedies, inspite oftheii possessing incommon the
poweis ofmotion (Saratval, subtlety, keenness, ex-
pansiveness and heat-making properties, tend to
lemove theinjurious andderanged morbific principles

virtue oftheir lespective inherent qualities (Prakriti)*.
Apuigative, inthecouise ofitsdigestion, carries down
with italltheDoshas fiom thesystem (loosened and
dislodged byviitue ofitsown specific properties) An
emetic, ontheothei hand, isnotdigested, owing to(its
lightness due to) itsinheient extiaordinaiy qualitiest,
but itsoon forces itswayupwith theDoshas (tobe)
removed. 21-22.
Astrong puigative given toamanofloose orlax

cannot remove alltheDoshas fullyowing totheir being
suddenly andfoicibly purged off. 23.
Apurgative medicine, which iscapable ofbeing
digested andofexpelling theDoshas from thebody
inthetimewhich amorning meal ordinarily takes to
bedigested, should beregarded aspie-eminently the
best. 24.

remedy under such circumstances consists inanointing

Thebodily Doshas areaggravated through deficient
orscanty vomitings under theaction ofanemetic drug
andexpands thiough theentire organism, giving rise
toitching, swelling, cutaneous affections, pustular erup
tions, fever, aching ofthelimbs, piercing painandsuch-
likesymptoms. Theremaining oruneliminated Doshas
should then beexpelled with (adequate) medicines of
strong potency (Mahaushadhi) Similarly, insufficient
purgings undei theaction ofamild purgative, ad-
ministered without aprevious application ofSneha
andSveda tothepatient, produce anumbed anddrum
likedistension oftheabdomen below theumbilicus,
causing aretention ofthestool and flatus, andproduce

(Mandala). The remedy undei these circumstances
should consist inemploying emulsive measures (Sneha)
and astronger purgative after having employed an

At!-yoga (Over-drugging with puigatives, etc)—
Women, merchants, persons attending aking and
pious BiAhmanas learned intheVedas (S'rotriya) are
often subjected tothenecessity oflepressing their
natuial urgings ofthebody towards micluniion, etc,
outofasense ofdelicacy, fearorgreed. TheVdyu in
their systems remains consequently aggravated and
accoidingly puigatives failtoeasily pioduce any effect
intheir organism. Hence theirsystem should beclean-

Excessive emission ofPitta [bile), lossofstiength
(Bala) andanaggiavation andaugmentation ofthe
deranged Vdyu follow from theoverdosage (Ati-yoga)
ofanemetic medicine. Insuch cases, thebody ofthe
patient should beanointed with clarified butter andhe

Nowwe shall discourse onthemedical treat-

injudicious application ofthepipeand ofthevasti
(Netravasti-Vsiypach-Chikitsitam). i.
IVIetr'ical Text :—Adisplacement orletro-
version ofthepipe duiing theapplication ofaVasti
produces apainful andbleeding ulcer intherectum,
which should betreated asarecent orincidental
ulcer. Anextremely up-turned ordown-turned posture
ofthepipe atthetime gives rise toapainiathe
rectum which should betreated with Pitta-subduing
remedies and sprinkled with Snehas (oil, clarified
butter, etc'Aslanting orone-sided posture ofthe
pipe after itsintroduction intotherectum causes its
mouth tobeclosed and thus pievents acomplete
andsatisfactory injection ofthefluid (into thebowels).
Hence itsmouth should beheld straight (and steady)
byanexperienced physician The useofanexcess-
ively thick oirough pipe orofonewith adown-
turned orbent mouth, pioduces ableeding and painful
ulcei intherectum which should beremedied inthe
manner mentioned above. The injection ofaVasti
proves abortive intheevent oftheKarnikd (attached

itself being broken oitoosmall. These defects should,
therefore, be'carefully avoided Inacase oftheKainikd

useofabladder (Vasti) toolarge ortoo thick are
identical with those which follow from animperfect

smaller efficacy isobtained from theuseofasmall
bladder capable (necessarily) ofinjecting asmaller

effects similar tothose resulting from theuseofa

fluid tobeused inchaiging aVast! should bethickened
intheevent ofitsextremely attenuated consistency and
vice vetsa. The application ofaVasti charged with a
fluid consisting ofanexcessive quantity ofSneha
would produce ageneial inertness oftheorganism,
(dullness oforganic functions), while one entirely

AnAnuvdsna-vasti maybeapplied inallparts of
thedayand night andeven (ifnecessary) without
anyprevious exhibition ofemetics and purgatives,
inthecase ofapatient inwhose system theVdyu has
been incarcerated and extremely aggravated. The
application ofaNirudha-vasti (enema) should, ibowever,
bemade inrespect ofaperson ofanextremely dry
temperament, orinwhose system thederanged and
aggravated V4yu extremely predominates, only after

empty stomach asitmight otherwise send theinjected
fluid higher upintotheintestines owing totheempti-
nessand cleansed “(unencumbered) state ofthesto-

made just after ameal, since theapplication ofaVasti
made during thecontinuance ofapartially digested
orundigested meal inthestomach brings onfever.
AnAnuvisana enema should not,however, beapplied
after thepatient hadtaken hismeal, richly saturated
orcooked withaSneha (oilorclaiifled butter), since the
double introduction oftheSneha into thesystem
through themedium offoodand theVasti brings on
vertigo and epilepsy The strength andcomplexion

theSneha-vasti. Themode ofapplying (theapparatus)
isdescribed under that ofNiruha-vasti. Heshould
bekept silently lying onhisback aslong asit
would take tocount ahundred words (Vak). The
potency (Virja) oftheinjected Sneha spreads through the
entire organism intheevent ofone’s lying with
outstretched limbs intheabove manner after the
application ofaSneha-vasti. The patient should be
gently struck# three times oneach ofthesoles andthe
palms ofhishands andonthebuttocksf. The (patient
with his)bedding should bethrice raised (andshaken
with gentle jerks). After that heshould belaidona

Aquantity ofSatdhvA andSaindhava should be

This istheprocedure ofapplying aSneha-vasti.
Six, seven, eight ornine applications ofSneha-vastis
should inthismanner bemade insuccession alternately
with those ofaNirudha-vasti. 24-A.
The Successive actions ofthe
Vast is:—The first application oftheVasti per-
meates thepelvic and theinguinal regions with the
emulcent essence oftheinjected Sneha. The second
tends torestore theVdyu inthecephalic partofthe
body toitsnormal condition. The third contributes
totheimprovement ofbodily strength andcomplexion.
Thefourth permeates theRasa (lymph chyle) with its
own oily essence Inthisway the fifth application
ofaVasti permeates the blood, the sixth the
flesh, theseventh the fat,theeighth thebones, and
theninth themarrow with the oily essence This
series ofVasti-applications repeated twice tends to
purify thesemen from allitsimpure orunhealthy
constituents. 24.
Aperson treated with eighteen series (three hun-
dredandtwenty-four innumber) ofsuch Sneha-vastis
andNiruha-vastis intheabove mentioned wayand
observing theprescribed rules ofdietandconduct is

aggravation ofthederanged Kapha, while anexcess of
thesecond (Niruha-vasti) tends toaggravate thebcdily
Vayu. Hence anapplication oftheSneha-vasli should
Ibefollowed byoneoftheNiruha-vasti and vicaversa,
inorder toavoid allapprehension ofanaggravation of
Pitta,Kapha andViyu. Daily applications ofaSneha-
vasti arenotforbidden inrespect ofaperson ofparched
ordry(Ruksha) andVdyu-predominating temperament,
while inother instances they should bemade oneach
fourth day, sothat thedigestive capacity might not

topeisons ofparched ordrytemperament Similarly,
anapplication oftheNiruha vast! inasmall quantity
always pioves beneficial tothepersons whohavebeen

Wheieas, ifdigested, itproduces butvery little benefit tothepatient. Theretention ofthewhole orofanypor-
tionoftheSneha injected into thebowels ofapatient
without producing any special physical discomfort
should beascribed toanextremely parched ordry

special medical treatment. 35-36.
IncaseofaSneha notflowing outfrom thebowels
within aperiod oftwenty-four houis ofitsintroduction
(and incase ofitsproducing anysupervening symp-
toms), corrective (S'odhana) leraedies should beemploy-
edand allsubsequent applications ofSneha should be

cious useofSneha (-Vastis) together with thenature of

Uttara-Vastis :—-Now weshall describe the
mode ofapplying anUttara-vaati (injection into the
urethra ofamale orofafemale patient). The pipe
tobeused forthepurpose (inthe case ofamale
patient) should bemade tomeasuie fourteen fingers
inlength, measured bythe patient’s own fingers It
should beshaped likethestem ofaMdlati flower (in
girth) atitstop-end andprovided with anaperture
admitting thepassage ofamustaid seed. Several
authorities hold that thelength ofthepipe should
beequal tothat ofthepenis (ofthe patient) The
largest dose ofaSneha tobeused inconnection with
anurethral injection (Uttara-vasti) isonlyoneKun-
cha(Pala);andthisshould bedetermined with discretion
inrespect ofpatients below twenty-five years ofage.
There should be(two) KamikSs (protrusions) inthe
middle part ofthepipe (Netra) inthecase ofamale.
Chap..KXXVn 3CHIKITSA STHANAM. 623
Inthecaseofafemale patient, however, theKarnikds
should beplaced above aspace offour fingers (from its
end) Thewhole pipeshould beten fingers inlength
andshould bemade tosuittheurethral channel (ofthe
patient) withanaperture sufficient toallow aMudga-
pulse topassthrough it. 38.
Inthecaseofavaginal douche orinjection (Vasti),
thepipeoftheUttara-vasti should beintroduced tothe
extent offour fingers only intothevaginal canal. Two
fingers onlyoftheentire length ofthepipe should be
inserted intothechannel oftheurethra inthecaseof
anadultwoman, whereas, mthecase ofayoung girl
oftender years, thepipe should beintroduced tothe
length ofone finger only. Here itshould benoted
thatthese measures aretobedetermined bythe
standard ofthepatient's own fingers APfasrita mea-
sureoftheSneha bywhich ismeant aquantity thatwould
becontained inthehollow ofthepalms ofthepatient’s
hand extending totheroots ofthephalanx isthe
largest dose tobeused inboth these instances. Inthe
caseofpatients oftender years thedosage should be
determined with discretion ineach case. 39.
TheVasti (bladder oftheenema) should bemade of
thebladder ofahog.Iamb, or,agoat, orinitsabsence,
oftheskin oftheneck ofabird, orofthe1^
ofaDrih (aleathern bag forholding water), orof

aswell asonthetreatment with aNirudha-vasti
(Nirudhopakrama-Chikitsitam). i.
Themode ofpreparing aVasti The
application ofanAnuvisana-vasti (enema) should be
followed bythat ofoneoftheAsthdpana class. The
body ofthepatient should be first anointed (with
aSneha) andfomented Previous totheapplication ofa
vasti, thebowels andbladder should berelieved ofall
(foecal) accumulations (flatus andunne). The clyster
(Vasti) should beapplied atnoon inawell-cleansed cham-
ber,devoid ofany gustofwind, andthepatient should
belaidonhisleftsideonaspacious bednotfurnished
withanypillows, butalittle raised upthere where his
buttocks would rest,and there should beattendants
athis feet. The patient should continue ina
cheerful mood with his leftthigh held inanout-
stretched posture and the right one flexed, and
should refrain fromspeaking toanybody. The diges-
tion oftheingested food taken bythe patient is
necessary (before theapplication ofthe Vasti). The
physician having placed thepipe oftheenema (Vasti)
upon hisleftfootshould firmly press itsKarniki with
the firstand thesecond toesofhisright foot One
halfofthemouth oftheVasti should bekept con-
tracted bypressing itwiththesmall andring finger ofhis
lefthandandthe(other) halfshould bestretched with
theaidofhisthumb, index andmiddle fingers, andthus

medicine). Thebladder filled with theproper quan-
tityofmedicinal solution should then beheld inthe
lefthand, andwashed with the right hand. Itshould
then befirmly tied (attheneck) justoverthe(surface
ofthe)medicinal solution with ligatures oftwo oithree
rounds ofthread. 2-A.
Themode ofapplying aVasti s-The
Vasti should then behelduponthepalm oftheright
hand, itspipe gripped with themiddle andindex fingers
ofthelefthand, andtheorifice closed with thethumb of
thesame hand. Theneck ofthepipeshould beprevious
lylubricated with claiified butter, andgently introduced
into thelectum ofthe patient upto itsKamU
(protuberance) along theline ofspinal column and
with itsmouth upturned. Thepatient should beasked
totakethesame with caie. 2.
IVletrical Text :—The physician should then
hold theenema (Vasti) with his lefthand andpress
itsbladdei with hisright. The injection (ofthemedi-
cinal solution contained intheenema) should bemade
atonce, neither tooslowly nortoohuiiiedly. 3.

Thetherapeutic effects ofDhuma-*
Pefna :—Smoking theSnehana-Dhuma subdues the
deranged andaggravated Viyu ofthebody owing to
theexistence oftheSneha withwhich itischarged,
aswell astoaconsequent sticky coating being
deposited intheorganism. TheVaireohaua-Dhtuna
facilitates theloosening andflowing outofthemucus
(Kapha) owing toitsdryness, non-viscidness (Vais'adya),
keenness and heat-making potency. While the
Prs£yogika-Dhnma tends toloosen theaccumulation of
mucus (Kapha) andhelps itsexpulsion from thesystem
byvirtue ofitsbeing possessed ofcommon therapeutic
properties with both ofthetwopreceding kinds (of
Dhuma). 12,

OnSnufi’s andErrhines The term
"Nasya” (Snuff) issocalled from thefact ofitsbeing
composed ofthepowders ofanydrugs orofany
Sneha (oleaginous substance) cooked with such drug
ordrugs, tobestuffed intothenostrils. Itmaybe
broadly divided intotwokinds, vis.:—^iro-Vireohana
(errhines) and Snehana (contributor ofoleaginous
principles); andmay,however, befurther grouped under
five specific heads, vis.—Nasya, ^iro-Virechana,
Pratimarsha (amedicated Sneha poured into the
nostrils tobedischarged into themouth), Avapida
(theexpressed juice ofanydrugputinto thenostrils
indrops bypressing itwiththepalms thenand there)
andFradhamaua (amedicinal snuff blown into the
nostril-, withthehelp ofablow pipe) Ofthese, the
Nasya (snuff) S'iro-Virechana (errhines) arepre-emi-
nently themost effective. Pratimarsha isaNasya while
Avapida andPradhamana arcSiro-Vircchana (errhines).
Thus itisthatthetermNasya isemployed intheabove
fivesenses. TheIcimNasya, inthe specific sense, is
particularly usedwith reference tothesnuffing ofany

Dhanvantari, theKing ofKds'i, theforemost in
virtue and religion andwhose commands brook no
disobedience orcontradiction, instructed hisdisciples,
Sus'ruta andothers (inthefollowing words). 2
Powerful enemies andeven theservants and rela-
tions ofthesovereign inafitofanger toavenge them-
selves onthesovereign sometimes concoct ipoisonous
compounds andadminister thesame tohim,powerful
though hemay be,bytaking advantage ofanydefect or
weak point inhim. Sometimes the.ladies (oftheroyal

preparations (offoodanddrink), which oftenprove tobe
poisonous fromafoolish motive ofsecuring hisaffection

T.'ie necessary' Qualifications ofa
Superintendent oftheRoyai kitchen:—Aking should appoint aphysician forthe royal
kitcLea (tosuperintend thepreparations oftheroyal
fare). Heshould bewell-paid and possess thefollow-
ing qualifications Heshould come ofarespect-
able family, should bevirtuous inconduct, fondly
attached totheperson ofhissovereign, andalways
watchful ofthehealth oftheking. Heshould be
greedless, straight-forward, god-fearing, grateful, of
handsome features, anddevoid ofirascibility, rough-
ness, vanity, arrogance and laziness. Heshould be
forbearing, self-controlled, cleanly, compassionate, well-
behaved, intelligent, capable ofbearing fatigue, well-
meaning, devoted,' ofgood address, clever, skilful,
smart, artless, energetic andmarked with alltheneces-
sary qualifications (ofaphysician; asdescribed before.
Heshould befully provided with allkinds of
medicine andbehighly esteemed bythemembers of
hisprofession. S-
Thenecessary features ofaRoyal
kitchen:—TheRoyal kitchen should beaspacious
chamber occupying anauspicious (south-east) comer of
theroyal mansion and built onacommendablesite.
The vessels andutensils (tobeused inaroyal kitchen)
should bekept scrupulously clean. Thekitchen shoul

bekept clean, welllighted bymeans ofalargenumber of
windows andguarded withnetsand fretworks (against
theintrusion ofcrows, etc.) None butthetrusted and
proved friends andrelatives should have access tothe
royal kitchen, orholdanyappointment therein. Highly
inflammable articles (such ashay, straw, etc.)should not
bestacked intheroyal kitchen whose ceiling should be
covered withacanopy TheFire-god should be(daily)
worshipped therein. Thehead ormanager oftheroyal
cooks should generally possess thesame qualifications
asthose ofaphysician The bearers andcooks inthe
royal kitchen should have their nails andhairclipped
offandshould bear turbans. They should becleanly,
civil, clever, obedient, good-looking, eachcharged with
separate duties, good-tempered, composed intheir
behaviour, well-bathed, grcedless, determined, and
prompt inexecuting theorders oftheir superiors. A
physician oftheroyal kitehen should bevery cautious
andcircumspect inthedischaige ofhisduties, since
food isthemain stayoflife,andthesolecontributor to
thesafecontinuance ofthebody. Every oneemployed
inaroyal kitchen such as,beaters, servers, cooks, soup-
makers, cake-makers (confectioners), should beplaced
undei thedirect control and supervision ofthephysi
cianofthekitchen 6.
Characteristic features ofapoison-
er :—Anintelligent physician wellqualified toasccitain
thetruestate ofone’s feelings from thespeech, fcon''uct,
demeanour anddistortions oftheface,would bea-(eto
discover thetrue culprit (poisoner) from thefollowing
external indications. Agiver ofpoison doesnotspeak

(indifferently), and willcut(straw orhay)with hisfinger-
nails, andhiscolour changes constantly. Hewillscratch
hishead inanagonised andconfused state, ami will
look thiswayand that, trying toslipawaybyaback or
sidedoor, thus betraying hisguilty conscience byhis
confusion. 7.
Aninnocent man, unjustly arraigned before theroyal
tribunal might from fearorprecipation, become (confused
and) liable tomake untrue statements (and thus be
unjustly convicted). Hence thekingshould first ofalJ
testthesincerity andfidelity ofhisservants ascertaining
thenon-poisonous character oftheboiled rice, drink,
tooth-twigs, unguents, combs, cosmetics, infusions,
washes, anointments (with sandal pastes, etc.), garlands
(offlowers, etc.), clothes, bedding, armour, ornaments,
shoes, foot-cushions, thebacks ofhorses andelephants and
snuffs (Nasya), Dhutna (tobacco smoking), collyriura and
suchother things (reserved fortheuseoftheking). 8-9.
Indications ofpoisoned food and
drink, etc. The indications bywhich the
poisonous character offood, drink, etc. (tobeusedby
aking)may bedetected aredescribed firstandthe
medical treatment isdealt with secondly. Aportion
ofthefood prepared fortheroyal useshould befirst
given tocrows and fliesand itspoisonous character
should bepresumed, ifthey instantaneously dieon
partaking ofthesame. Poisoned food burns making
loud cracks, andwhen castintothe fire itassumes the
colour ofapeacock’s throat, becomes unbearable, bums
insevered and disjointed flames andemits irritating
fumes and itcannot bespeedily extinguished.The

asfortheprotection ofthesovereign master. lo.
Thevapours arising from poisoned foodwhen served
forusegive risetoapain inthecardiac region andpro-
duce headache and restlessness oftheeyes. Asan
antidote, apreparation ofKiishtha, Rdmatha (asafoetida),
Nalada andhoney mixed together should beused asan

thesame drugs should besnuffed intothenostrils. A
plaster composed ofSirisha, turmeric, and sandal
pasted together orsimply asandal paste should beused
overtheregion oftheheart insuch cases ii.
Apoison affecting thepalms ofthehands, produces
aburning sensation inthem andleads tothefalling off
ofthefinger-nails. Theremedy insuch cases consists
inapplying aplaster ofS'yamd*, Indra, Gopasomaand

laiddown inconnection with thetreatment ofcases of
poisonous vapours aswell asthose tobehereinafter
described inconnection with theuseofapoisoried

Food mixed with poison, when itreaches the
Amtsaya. (stomach), gives risetoepileptic fits,vomiting,
dysenteric stools (Atis&ra), distention oftheabdomen, a
burning sensation, shivering andaderangement of
thesense-organs. Under such circumstances anemetic
consisting ofMadana, Aldvu, Vimbi andKoddtaki
pasted together andadministered through themedium
ofmilk, curdandUdasvit (Takra) orwith rice-washings
should beunderstood astheproper remedy. 14.
Food mixed with poison, ifitreaches thePakvi

Ifthetooth-twig beanyway charged with poison its
brush-like end iswithered and shattered and ifused
gives risetoaswelling ofthelipsandthetongue and
about thegums. Insuchacase, theswollen partshould
befirstrubbed (withanyleafofrough fibre) andthen
gently rubbed with aplaster composed ofDh&taki
flowers, Pathyd, stones ofJambuline (black-berry) and
honey pasted together. Asanalternative, thepatt
should begently rubbed anddusted overwith aplaster
ofpowdered Amkotha roots orSapta-chchada bark or

Poisoned articles forAbhyanga (oilsandunguents)
look thick, slimy ordiscoloured andproduce, when
used, eruptions ontheskinwhich suppurate andexude
acharacteristic secretion attended with pain, perspira-
tion, feverandbursting ofthe flesh. Theremedy in
suchacase consists insprinkling coldwater over the
body ofthepatient and inapplying aplaster ofsandal

equally commended inthepresent instance, Symptoms
which mark theuseofpoisoned armour, garments,
bedding, cosmetic, washes, infusions, anointments, etc.
and theremedies forthese are identical with those
consequent upon theuseofpoisoned unguents. 21-22.
Apoisoned plaster (ifapplied tothehead) leads to
thefalling offofthehairandtoviolent headache, bleeding
through themonth andthenostrils, etc,andtheappear-
ance ofglands onthehead. Theremedy insuchacase
consists intheapplication ofaplaster made ofblack
earth treated (Bhdvita) several times with the bile ofa
Rishya (aspecies ofdeer), clarified butter and theex-
pressed juice ofS'ydmd, Pdliudi (Trivrit) and Tandti-
liyaka (insuccession). The expressed juice ofMd!ati
(flower) orofMitsMka-parni, fluid-secretions offresh
cow-dung andhouse-soot asexternal applications are
alsobeneficial insuch cases. 23,
Incases ofpoisoning through head-unguents or
through apoisoned tutban,capgarland offlJowers,
orbathing water, measures andremedies aslaiddotvn

cosmetics applied tothe face,,' the local skin assumes
abluish ortawny brown colour covered with eruptions
likethose incases ofPadmini-kantaka andthesymptoms
peculiar toacaseofusing apoisoned unguent become
manifest. Theremedy insuch acase consists intheap-
plication ofaplaster composed of(white) sandalwood,
clarified butter, Payasyd, Yaskti fnadhu,Phanju(BhSrgi),
Vandhujiva andPattarnavd. Apotion ofhoney an
clarified butter isalso beneficial inthis case. 2425-

Apoisoned elephant usually exhibits suchsymptoms
asrestlessness, copious salivation andredness ofthe
eyes. Thebuttocks, thepenis, theanalregion and the
scrotum ofitsridercoming incontact with thebody of
suchanelephant aremarked byeruptions Under such
conditions both theanimal and itsrider should bemedi-
cally treated with theremedies laiddown inthe
treatment ofpoisoning through anunguent. 26,
Apoisoned snuff (Nas3ra) orpoisoned smoke (Dhuma)
produces bleeding from themouth and nose, etc,pain
inthehead, adischatgc ofmucus andaderangement
ofthefunctions ofthesense-organs. Theremedy in
such cases consists indrinking andsnuffing* apotion of
clarified butter dulycooked with themilk ofacow
orsuchother animal together with Ativishd, Vaeha and
Mallikd flower (asKalka). Apoisoned garland (of
flowers) ischaracterised bythelossofodour andby
thefading anddiscolouring ofitsnatural colour, and
when smelt produces headache andlachrymation. Re-
medies laiddown under theheads ofpoisoning through
vapour (Dhuma) andthrough cosmetics fortheface
(Mukha-lepa) should beusedandapplied. 27-28.

General Treatment The symptoms
which characterise cases ofpoisoning commencing with
"poisoning through poisoned smoke" andending with

caseswhere bleeding would bebeneficial. 33-34.
Thedrugs known asMushtkd andAjarultd should
betiedround thewrists ofaking asprophylactics to
guard against theeffects ofpoisoned food, since either
ofthese twodrugs (invirtue oftheir specific properties)
tends toneutralise theoperativeness ofthepoison. A
king surrounded byhisdevoted friends shall cover his
chest (with drugs ofheart-protecting virtues) and shall
drink those preparations ofclarified butter, which

produce insanity. Some ofthem arecharacterised by
anobstinate constipation ofthebowels (Andba), others,
byaninvoluntary emission ofsemen while afewothers
produce confused speech, Kushtha (leprosy), orsome
other similar disease 22.

Wehave briefly said before that there arcsixteen
situations ofpoison inthebodies ofvenomous animals.
Nowweshall dealwiththem indetail. 2.
Locations —An animal poison isusually
situated inthefollowing parts, vis, the sight, breath,
teeth, nails, urine, stool, semen, saliva, menstrual blood,
stings, belching*, anus, bones, bile, bristles (^uka) and
inthedeadbody ofananimal. 3.
Ofthese, thevenom ofcelestial serpents liesintheir

Properties ofpoisons Allthesharp
and violent qualities arcpicscnt inpoison. Hence
poisons should beconsidered asaggravating andand
deranging alltheDoshas ofthebody. TheDoshas
aggravated andcharged with poison forego theirown
specific functions. Hence poison cannever bedigested
orassimilated inthesystem. Itstops thepower of
inhaling. Expiration (exhalation ofthebreath) becomes
impossible owing totheinternal passages having been
choked bythederanged Kapha. Consequently a
poisoned person diops down inanunconscious state
evenwhen life isstillpicscnt within hisbody 14

gatheied upand secreted through theholes ofits
fangs under theconditions ofanger and agitation. The
fangs being hook-shaped, asnake cannot secrete its
poison without lowering itshood just after abite. 15,
General treatment ofpoisoning:—
Since apoison ofwhatever sort isextremely keen,
sharp andheat-making initspotency, acopious sprink-
ling with cold water should beused inallcases of
poisoning Butsince thepoison ofaninsect ismild
andnottoomuch heat-making initspotency and as
itengenders alaige quantity ofVdyu andKapha inthe
oiganism, measures offomentation tSveda) arenot
forbidden inacase ofinsect-bite Abitebya

The poison ofavenomed dait orofasnake-
bitecourses through thewhole organism ofthevictim
but itisitsnature that itreturns totheplace ofhurt
andbite respectively. Aman eating, from culpable
gluttony, theflesh ofsuchananimal, justdead (from the
effects ofpoison), isafflicted withsymptoms anddiseases
peculiar tothespecific pathr^enetic virtues ofthepoison
withwhich thedeadbody ischarged, and, inthelong
run.meets with hisdoom. Hence the flesh ofan
animal killed byavenomed dartorasnake bite(should
beconsidered asfatal asthepoison itself and) should
notbetaken immediately after itsdeath. Thefl^h

forty eight minutes i^Muhurta) from itsdeath after te

andwhose complexion becomes discoloured, andwhose

Symptoms ofthedifferent stagfes
ofpoisoning' fromthebites ofaDarvi-

them) Thepoison ofasnake oftheDarvi-kara species
affects andvitiates theblood (vascular system) inthefirst
stage ofItscourse oritsphysiological transformation in
thebody. Theblood thereby turns black, imparting iti

swellings andGranthis alloverthebody. Inthethird
stage itinvades thepiinciple ofMedas (adipose tissues?)
inthebody, giving risetoasoit ofmucous discharge
from theseatofbite,heaviness inthehead, perspiration
andnumbness oftheeyes. Inthefourth stage the
poison enters theKoshtba (abdomen?) andaggravates
theDoshas, especially Kapha, producing somnolence,
water biash andabreaking sensation inthejoints. In
the fifth stage, itpenetrates intothepiinciple ofbone,
deranges thePrana (vital principle) and impairs the
Agni (digestive fire),giving lise tohiccough, aburning
sensation inthebodyandabieaking pain inthejoints.
Inthesixth stage, itenters theprinciple ofMajjan
(marrow) andgreatly deranges theGrahani (the large
intestines j)giving rise toasense ofheaviness ofthe
limbs, dysentery, pain intheheart and epileptic fils.
Intheseventh stage itpermeates the principle of
semen, extremely aggravates the vital nerve-governing
Vdyuknown astheVydna, dislodges theKapha even
from theminutest capillaries, pioducing secretions of

CHAPTER V.
Nowweshall discourse ontheChapter which deals
with themedical treatment ofsnake-bites (Sarpel-*
dashta Kaipa~Chikitsitam).
General treatment ofSnake-bites
Inallcases ofsnake bites Hgatuies ofcloth, skin, soft
fibre oranyother softarticle (consecrated with the
proper Mantras), should first ofallbebound four
fingers apart above theseatofthebite intheevent of
itsoccurring inthe extremities, inasmuch assuch a
proceeding would arrest thefurther (uprvard) course of
thepoison inthebody. Asanalternative, theseat of
thebiteshould beincisioncd, bledandcauterized where
suchaligature would befound tobeimpossible. Inci-
sion, cauterization, andsucking (ofthepoisoned blood
from theseatofthebite)should behighly recommend-
edinallcases ofsnake-bites Thecavity ofthemouth
should befilled withalinen* before sucking (theblood
from thewound). Itwould dotheman bitten bya
snake animmense good ifhecould bitetheserpent
thathadbitten himorfailing that, biteaclod ofearth
without anylossoftime 2-3.
Theseatofthe bitebyaMandali snake should not,
however, becauterized inasmuch asthepreponderant
Pittaja character ofthepoison, aggravated bytheappli-
cation oftheheat,might leadtoitsspeedy expansion
orcoursing inthesystem. 4Mantras :—Aphysician well-versed inthe
Mantras ofanti-venomous potency should bind a

ligature ofcord consecrated with appropriate Mantras
which would arrest afurther spread ofthe poison.
TheMantras full ofoccult energy ofperfect truth
and divine communion, disclosed bytheDevarshis
andBrahmaishis ofyore, never failtoeliminate the
poison from thesystem, and hold theirown even
incases ofdeadliest poisons Elimination ofthepoison
with thehelpofMantras, fulloftheenergy ofBrahma,
oftruthand austerities, ismore rapid than under the
effects ofdrugs. 5.A.
Aman, while learning theMantras, should forego
sexual intercourse, animal diet,wine, honey, etc.,should
beself-controlled and clean inbody and spirit and
(before learning theMantras) shall lieonamattress
ofKus'a-grass. Forthesuccessful application ofhis
newly acquired knowledge (Mantras', heshall devo-
tedly worship thegods with offerings ofperfumes,
garlands offlowers, edibles, (animal) oblations, etc.,and
with theappropriate Mantras sacred tothem aswell as
withburnt offerings, since aMantra chanted byaman
inanunclean spirit orbody, oraccented oruttered in-
correctly willnottake effect. Themedicinal compounds
ofanti-venomous drugs should alsobeemployed insuch

Plasters ofanti-poisonous drugs (Agada) should be
applied alllound theseatofthebite after scarifying it,
which should besprilclcd with water mixed with (red)
Sandal wood andUs’ira oiwith their decoction The
appropriate Agada compounds (according tothenature
ofthebite)should beadministeied through themedium
ofmilk, honey and clarified buttei, etc. Intheabsence
ofthese, thepatient should bemade totake (asolution
of)theblack eaith ofananthill(dissolved inwater)
Asanalternative, (apaste of)Koviddia, S'itiska, Atka
andKatabht should beprescribed forhim. Thepatient
should notbeallowed totake oil,thesoup ofKulattJm-
pulse, wine andSauviiaka. The patient should be
made tovomit with thehelp ofanyother suitable
liquid available, sincevomiting inmost cases leads to
theelimination ofthepoison from thesystem 6.

The person inwhom thepoison (ofarabiddogor
jackal, etc.) isspontaneously aggravated hasnochance
ofrecovery. Hence thepoison should beartificially
aggravated (andthenlemedied) before reaching thatstagc
ofaggravation. The patient should bebathed atthe
crossing ofloads oionthebank ofariver with pitcher-
fulsofwater containing gemsandmedicinal drugs and

The poison ofa(rabid) dog, etc., liesintheteeth

Tungi-ndsa, Vichilaka, Tfilaka, V4haka, Koshthdgdri,
Krimikara, Mandala-Puchchhaka, Tunga-ndbha, Sarsha-

symptoms similar tothose ofacaseofasnake-bite and
their poison tends toderange andaggravate thethree
Doshas (StfomipsCtika) ofthebody andproduce the
specific symptoms thereof 6-A.
Symptoms oftheir bite:— The seat of

(ofaspider) gives rise tonon-shrftting superficial
Kotha (urticaria) attended with itching and slight
pain. The poison from ascratch with thetipsofits
plaws, isattended with swelling, itching, horripilation
and asense asiffumes hadbeen escaping from the

these insects andthecurable andincurable natures of
their bites together with thecourse ofmedical treatment
tobefollowed ineach case. 48
mythological account oftheorigin
ofLut£t :—Once upon atime, itissaid, king
Vis'vamitra went tothehermitage oftheholy Vas'ishtha
andbyhisactions aroused thewrath oftheholy sage.
Drops ofperspiration were thereupon produced on
theforehead ofthat holyand celestially brilliant sage
and trickled down onthestacks ofhay culled and
gathered (Luna^ bytheholysages fortheuseofthe
(celestial) cow,andbehold 1they (thedrops ofsweat)
weretransformed intoinnumerable dreadful andvenom-
ousspiders (Lut^) which, uptothisday, arefound to
infest the articles ofroyal use fortheiniquity of
that royal sage (Vis'vimitra) They arecalled Luttis,
fspiders) from the factoftheii being germinated from
thedrops ofperspiration oftheholy sage Vas'ishtha
fallen ontheculled (Luna) stacks ofhayandthey are
sixteen innumber 49.

Wehave described (thesymptoms andthetreatment
ofthebites of)theeight classes ofspiders which can
cured with difficulty. Tnose ofthetwoclasses (ofthe
Chap. VItI.J KAMA STHANAII. 759

alsobeen described abovci asbeing sometimes found
amenable tomedicine (with thegreatest difficulty).
Now hearmedescribe (thesymptoms andthetreat-
ment ofthebites of)theremaining sixspecies which
areincurable, 63.A.
Specific Symptoms oftheincurable
cases ofSpider-bites :—Abitebyaspider of
theSaavarnikai species ismarked byswelling anda
frothy secretion andafishy smell from thescat ofthe

Treatment oftheincurable cases ofspider-bites
should, however, betaken inhandbyawise physician
with adueconsideration oftheaggravated Dosha or
Doshas ineach case with theexception ofmaking
incisions (chheda-karma)
