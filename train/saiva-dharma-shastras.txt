THE WATERCOLOR ON THE COVER IS THE 1994 WORK OF 
NEW YORK ARTIST VERA ROSENBERRY , COMMISSIONED
 by Himâlayan Academy. In it she has depicted the ancient 
and modern Hindu global experience. The entire left half 
of the painting, executed in traditional two-dimensional Rajput style, 
depicts Hinduism in olden days. The right side of the art portrays contempo-
rary Hindu experience, modern life around the world as lived today by nearly 
one billion Hindus. Not only does the artist change the subject, but also the style, 
so the right side is executed in three-dimensional form. In the middle, appropri-

WHAT IS A CHURCH? FIRST AND FOREMOST, A CHURCH IS 
A GROUP OF DEVOUT PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE SAME BE LIEFS. A CHURCH’S PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE TO PRE-
SERVE THE DOCTRINES OF FAITH AND TRADITION AND 
to serve the needs of the congregation. The clergy preserve theological doctrine and teach it to members. Clergy and lay members together min-ister to the needs of the congregation. This they do through sermons and devotional services, through counseling for personal and family problems, assistance offered in times of hardship, religious and secular education for the youth, missionary work and spiritual, social and cultural events. A church seeks to up lift and guide its members in the fulfillment of all 
four aspects of their life: spiritual, cultural, social and economic. Our Íaiva Siddhânta Church has through the grace of my satguru, the vener-able sage of Sri Lanka, Y ogaswâmî, grown stronger and stronger through the years in the fulfillment of the above-stated purposes. It all started in 1949 when, with a powerful slap on the back and instructions for my spiri-tual mission, Y ogaswâmî initiated me into this ancient siddhar lineage. This compendium of Íaiva culture for successful, harmonious living on planet earth is dedicated to that great soul who was spiritual monarch of his nation for half a century and whose four Great Sayings are: 
Thanai Ari—Know your Self by yourself. 
Sarvam Íivamayam—All is Íiva. 
Ellaam Íivan Seyal—Íiva’s Will be done. 
Summa Iru—Be still. Dedication

THEIR FUTURE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. FURTHER, IT 
IS A DOSSIER DESCRIBING FOR CHURCH MEMBERS AND THE 
public our international headquarters, monasteries, missions and extend-
ed families, our Himâlayan Academy, ministry and initiations, our family and monastic paths, articles of faith and conduct. It explains our World 
Outreach Mission: to protect, preserve and promote the Íaivite Hindu reli-
gion, to foster the growth of all sects of Hinduism through Hindu solidar-
ity and to teach monistic Íaiva Siddhânta for the spiritual unfoldment of 
the individual and the family through temple worship and daily sâdhana. 
How members live, conduct themselves, raise their families and perform 
their dharma is all elucidated here . This ßâstra portrays a fellowship 
that is a one body of belief, worship and allegiance. Each member has 
studied and upholds the same scriptures and creed . Each worships God 
Íiva through the traditional ceremonies and sacred observances. Each 
is well versed in the teachings of our sampradâya, a tradition that val-
ues practice above learning.  Each finds authority in our religious hier-
archical lineage, or paramparâ . Each performs the potent sâdhanas of 
the Íaiva Neri, regular disciplines which yield spiritual transformation 
through self-effort. Each looks to the spiritual preceptor, or satguru, as 
the supreme guiding force. This is the seventh edition of Íaiva Dharma 
Íâstras . The first was issued as a manual in 1958. Subsequent editions 
were released in 1971, 1980, 1981 and 1982 to reflect the needs of a growing, worldwide organization. The sixth edition evolved out of my 1986 pasto-
ral world tour. In 1973—with the advent of the Lemurian, Dravidian and 
Íaivite Íâstras, known collectively as the Lord Subramaniam Íâstras —the 
spirit and culture of our international Church was slowly molded into the 
patterns described in those ancient books read from the âkâßic library 
of Lord Subramaniam. One of the remarkable things about the ßâstra

Introductionenergy. As predicted in the Íaivite Íâstras,  by 1995, the year we are in now, 
our pattern is set, and constant preservation and perpetuation is commis-
sioned by me and by the inner worlds for its fulfillment generation after 
generation for over a thousand years into the future of futures, for ever 
and ever. Y ea, much longer than that, much longer than forever, for these 
ßâstras give the explanation of life as it is to be lived and has been lived by 
a healthy, happy, spiritually productive, small inner group and larger outer 
group, both ever growing in strength and numbers. Listen now to the great 
ßâstra that guides my successors and their successors and theirs and theirs 
into the future of futures as a unified, traditional body of servants of Íiva. 
The Lord 
SubramaniamÍâstras¶Within these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras  we quote extensively 
from the Íaivite Íâstras and the Lemurian and Dravidian 
Íâstras, two texts from our Lord Subramaniam Íâstras, 
revealed to me clairvoyantly in 1973. The Lemurian and Dravidian Íâstras 
are being released to dîkshâ ßishyas under the title Lemurian Scrolls,  but 
the Íaivite Íâstras  will continue to be a private text restricted to our 
monastics under vows. In quoting from these three texts in Íaiva Dharma 
Íâstras we have brought forth the principles that will be most helpful to 
students and members of our fellowship who seek to understand the inner 
workings of this glorious inner and outer universe.
A Hymn
From SageYogaswâmî¶I conclude this brief introduction to a prodigious work 
with a profound hymn composed by my preceptor, Satg-
uru Åsân Y ogaswâmî, spiritual master for half a century 
of Sri Lanka’s 2.5 million Íaiva Tamil peoples. In this proclamation, Åsân 
Y ogaswâmî sets the sâdhana s for all sincere Íaivites now and in the future. 
Listen, while I tell you the path to liberation:
Truth, patience, calmness and discipline of self;
Discrimination twixt the eternal and the passing;Devotion to the humble servants of the Lord;
Rising in the early morn and bathing before daybreak;Repeating in the way prescribed the flawless letters five;
Worshiping the guru’s feet, applying holy ash;
Eating but when hungry, with the whole heart giving praise;
Studying the ßâstras, seeing others as oneself;
Severing attachment to all property and wealth;Speaking with fit courtesy, avoiding argument;
Driving from the mind all thought of family and caste;Being ever free of the smallest like or dislike;
guages through The Master Course  and Dancing with Íiva. Hindu solidar-
ity is being forged through H INDUISM  TODAY . Kulapati missionaries and 
ma†havâsi ministers are serving tirelessly. 
The Working
Together of the Three W orlds¶The Íaivite Íâstras , the inner-plane prophecy that has 
guided our Church since it was clairvoyantly read in 1973, 
predicted in verse 471 what we now see has come to pass: 
“By the time 1995 arrived, the inner order and the outer order of Íaivism 
worked in harmony with the band of Mahâdevas in the Third World. Lord 
Skanda and Umâga∫eßa and Lord Íiva Himself were pleased at this band 
of great Lemurian souls working together in the Second World and the 
First World. Constant rays from cosmic galaxies began to penetrate these 
monasteries deep into the earth, some so strong they penetrated through 
the earth. This permanent ßakti that vibrated all the temple land resound-
ed through the countryside, establishing a peace of mind and abundant consciousness for those who lived within the radiance of this darßana 
of the monasteries and temples. Looking into the future, we can see this 
vibration growing in the ground.” 
These Íâstras
Shall GuideOur Future¶The arrival of 1995 is indeed a great event for all of us, 
a fulfillment of the magical Íaivite Sâstras  so generously 
composed by divine ®ishis and master adepts in the Antar-
loka, or astral plane . As this year, 1995, unfolds, the past has met the pres-
ent, and it is truly a glorious time, because I can now add to the great 
inner-plane manuscripts first read from the âkâßa  in 1973 these Íaiva 
Dharma Íâstras, the story of our contemporary Church’s ideals, day-to-day 
customs and procedures. Lemurian Scrolls and these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras 
are the legacy  I leave my âchârya successors , their guidelines and firm 
laws , their commission to follow and fulfill, along with The master Course  
trilogy— Dancing, Living and Merging with Íiva,  and Shum, the language 
of meditation . Our pattern has been completed, the prophecy manifest-
ed better than any of our expectations. We are eternally grateful for the 
untiring help the Gods, devas and ®ishis have provided ever since the Lord 
Subramaniam Íâstras  were revealed, a profoundly needed message from 
the past for the present, now preserved for the future. My âchârya succes-
sors  will have a momentous task, to be sure. They who have striven so 
hard to fulfill their holy orders of sannyâsa will have these Íaiva Dharma 
Íâstras, the Lord Subramaniam Íâstras and the Ma†havâsi Íâstras as their 
discipline, their sâdhana and, yes, sometimes their tapas. As the future is 
based upon the past, this recorded past within these Íâstras  releases new 
He who knows God 
as the Life of life, the Eye of the eye, the Ear of the ear, the Mind of the mind—he indeed compre-hends fully the Cause of all causes.

ma†havâsi ministers are serving tirelessly. 
The Working
Together of the Three W orlds¶The Íaivite Íâstras , the inner-plane prophecy that has 
guided our Church since it was clairvoyantly read in 1973, 
predicted in verse 471 what we now see has come to pass: 
“By the time 1995 arrived, the inner order and the outer order of Íaivism 
worked in harmony with the band of Mahâdevas in the Third World. Lord 
Skanda and Umâga∫eßa and Lord Íiva Himself were pleased at this band 
of great Lemurian souls working together in the Second World and the 
First World. Constant rays from cosmic galaxies began to penetrate these 
monasteries deep into the earth, some so strong they penetrated through 
the earth. This permanent ßakti that vibrated all the temple land resound-
ed through the countryside, establishing a peace of mind and abundant consciousness for those who lived within the radiance of this darßana 
of the monasteries and temples. Looking into the future, we can see this 
vibration growing in the ground.” 
These Íâstras
Shall GuideOur Future¶The arrival of 1995 is indeed a great event for all of us, 
a fulfillment of the magical Íaivite Sâstras  so generously 
composed by divine ®ishis and master adepts in the Antar-
loka, or astral plane . As this year, 1995, unfolds, the past has met the pres-
ent, and it is truly a glorious time, because I can now add to the great 
inner-plane manuscripts first read from the âkâßa  in 1973 these Íaiva 
Dharma Íâstras, the story of our contemporary Church’s ideals, day-to-day 
customs and procedures. Lemurian Scrolls and these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras 
are the legacy  I leave my âchârya successors , their guidelines and firm 
laws , their commission to follow and fulfill, along with The master Course  
trilogy— Dancing, Living and Merging with Íiva,  and Shum, the language 
of meditation . Our pattern has been completed, the prophecy manifest-
ed better than any of our expectations. We are eternally grateful for the 
untiring help the Gods, devas and ®ishis have provided ever since the Lord 
Subramaniam Íâstras  were revealed, a profoundly needed message from 
the past for the present, now preserved for the future. My âchârya succes-
sors  will have a momentous task, to be sure. They who have striven so 
hard to fulfill their holy orders of sannyâsa will have these Íaiva Dharma 
Íâstras, the Lord Subramaniam Íâstras and the Ma†havâsi Íâstras as their 
discipline, their sâdhana and, yes, sometimes their tapas. As the future is 
based upon the past, this recorded past within these Íâstras  releases new 
He who knows God 
as the Life of life, the Eye of the eye, the Ear of the ear, the Mind of the mind—he indeed compre-hends fully the Cause of all causes.

About the 
Name of OurFellowship5 ¶The name of our Hindu church is Íaiva Siddhânta 
Church, meaning “sacred congregation of Supreme God 
Íiva’s revealed Truth.” These two Sansk®it words and one 
English word we consider to be our international trademark. No other 
terms should be substituted for the word church  when writing or convers-
ing in English. The word church may be translated into other languages for 
purposes of conversation. It may also be so translated for legal documents, 
such as for registration of mission groups, as deemed preferable by the par-
ent Church. Such translations shall always use the official terms approved 
by the Church . In such translations, based on the pattern of well-established 
local churches, we choose words that most strongly convey this meaning: a 
one-minded, hierarchical body of devotees, following a single doctrine of 
belief, with strict codes of conduct, an initiated priesthood, ministry and 
missionaries, well-defined sacraments, shared scriptural authority and 
exclusivity of membership free of other alliances. We know that the term 
church will, in some communities, carry great respect and power, and in 
other communities it may be demeaned and belittled. Knowing theirs is 
the world’s first Hindu church on the planet, our members use the name 
Íaiva Siddhânta Church (or its equivalent as traditionally rendered in the 
world’s many languages) boldly in all instances, defending its use when 
needed. Finally, it must be emphasized that while we adhere strongly to 
the institutional structure of church, we do so to most effectively convey the pure, traditional Sanâtana Dharma as expressed in the Veda s. As one 
of the world’s most orthodox congregations, our use of this institutional 
structure should never be misconstrued as carrying or even implying any 
Christian or Western religious content.
Church as a
Legal, SocialStructure6 ¶While the Greek-based word church  is most com-
monly understood as a place of worship, the full meaning 
encompasses the religious congregation and organization 
on many levels of activity. Church takes on special importance in legal 
and governmental discussions, where matters of church and state are fre-quently focused on. In more and more nations, in federal and state gov-ernments, religion is defined as church,  and the separation of church and 
state  is respected and constitutionally enforced. Such protections, ground-
ed in the concept of church,  are crucial to the rights of all religious groups. 
These include protection from government  and from other religions which 
may seek to dominate faiths with less political power. 
By austerity, 
goodness is obtained. From goodness, under-standing is reached. From understanding, the Self is obtained, and he who obtains the Self is freed from the cycle of birth and death.

MAITRU 4.3. UPR, 810quarters  on Kauai, Hawaii on February 5, 1970. From this Garden Island 
in the Pacific Ocean, northernmost of the Hawaiian chain that forms the 
world’s most remote land mass, the Church broadly serves the 850-million-
strong Hindu faith (fully one-sixth of the human family). The Church’s 
ministry  is dedicated to nurturing the membership and local missions in 
four continents and to serving, primarily through publications, the com-
munity of Hindus throughout the world.
A Summary
Of ChurchAttainments3 ¶Over the last nearly half-century, our Church has cre-
ated a swâmî order and a theological seminary to train 
young men from many nations and mold them into reli-
gious leaders to later take holy orders of sannyâsa. We have nurtured an 
extended family membership that upholds and sets new standards of 
personal dedication, inner effort, home culture and public protocol in 
these contemporary times when the diaspora of Hindus has brought them to nearly all countries of the world. Further, in a broader way we—our 
monastic order  and close family members  and I working in one-minded-
ness—have played a crucial role in Hinduism’s transition from the agri-
cultural era into the technological age and on into the age of information and the new age of space. 
An Impact 
Beyond SmallNumbers4 ¶These efforts have indeed been amplified beyond 
our small numbers, furthered in many ways: reporting 
globally to a quarter-million readers through our award-
winning journal, H INDUISM  TODAY , and more through the Internet and 
its World Wide Web;  translating and publishing scripture and religious 
literature; coordinating related graphics and art projects; collaborating 
and sharing resources with hundreds of individuals and institutions who 
share our commitment to effectively spreading Hindu Dharma; conduct-
ing children’s schools, youth retreats and gurukulams; training monastics 
and providing for members temple services, including sacraments such as 
name-giving, first-feeding, marriage and funeral rites. In these efforts, we 
have worked closely with an advisory council of priests, pa∫∂itas, ßâstrîs, 
swâmîs and aadheenakartar s in India, Sri Lanka, the United States, Mau-
ritius, Malaysia, Europe and South Africa and followed their wise advice 
and guidance. Our congregation  has grown as a strict and traditional 
global family of monastics, close initiates, novitiates and students. It is, 
therefore, intentionally not large. It takes a humble place among legions of 
Hindu institutions substantially larger and far older, some founded more 
than two millennia ago. The measure of this body of devotees is not its

Activities
Of our Ma†havâsis10 ¶My ma†havâsis  serve in a number of capacities: teach-
ing ha†ha yoga,  philosophy and meditation, counseling lay 
members through telephone contact, correspondence and 
personal visitations; conducting youth retreats and other seminars; giv-
ing darßana to large and small groups; publishing, translation, cyberspace 
communication and knowledge-resource development for other Hindu organizations worldwide. They oversee and participate in monastery care, cooking, carpentry, planting and harvesting, dairy management and 
groundskeeping. Ma†havâsi âchâryas, swâmîs, yogî s and sâdhakas also 
serve as priests  in our temples. For elaborate ceremonies, however, we call 
upon the venerable Íivâchâryas , the preeminent lineage of Íaiva temple 
priests, the elders of whom have trained and sanctioned our ma†havâsis  
to perform certain rites for Church members in our temples. In this capac-
ity my monks are known as monastic priests or aadheenârchakas. In Hin-
duism, temple priests and ma†havâsis comprise two separate traditions. 
One is married; the other is unmarried and celibate. Tradition demands 
that monks not identify too closely with the priestly vocation, lest they 
become overly involved in the concerns of the public. 
Our Monks
Comprise aSâdhu Ministry11 ¶Instead, my ma†havâsis identify with and 
im merse themselves in the concerns of the over three 
million sâdhus  and swâmîs of India, a number pub-
lished in 1995 in the Washington Post  in an article about the Godmen 
of India. This is a seemingly vast number, but is actually only an aver-age of four renunciates for each of India’s 700,000 villages and count-
less cities comprising a total population of 800 million. Thus, in India, 
roughly three out of every 1,000 persons have taken up the full-time 
spiritual life. These are the holy ones, dharma’s lighthouse, the per-
petuators of the faith. India’s ratio of monks to g®ihasthas, lay per-
sons,  falls in line with the proven demographics  of successful ministry: 
of one pastor serving the spiritual needs of one hundred families, or about 300 people, in order to maintain a healthy, viable congregation. 
Householder
MissionariesAnd Teachers12 ¶For the sake of those who may think of an âßrama as a 
commune accommodating all seekers, regardless of gender, 
we must reaffirm that our âßramas are strictly cloistered 
monasteries  for celibate men. We follow the aadheenam traditions of South 
India. G®ihastha  members of our fellowship live in their own homes in the 
The cosmic soul 
is truly the whole universe, the immortal source of all creation, all action, all medita-tion. Whoever discov-ers Him, hidden deep within, cuts through the bonds of ignorance even during his life on earth.

The ChurchInternationally7 ¶When the Church  is legally founded in other countries, 
the registered name would include the country, with the 
board of trustees  comprised solely of the Guru Mahâsan-
nidhânam and his select group of âchâryas who are the stewards of the 
international Church in the United States. A prime example is our Íaiva 
Siddhânta Church of Mauritius, registered in 1986 through an act of par-
liament, with the Hawaii-based stewards  in absolute control. Only in this 
way can we own property and establish branch monasteries . outside the 
United States. 
Ecclesiastical
HeadquartersIn Hawaii8 ¶The Church’s international headquarters  is Kauai’s 
Hindu Monastery, Kauai Aadheenam , located in the 
Wailua Homesteads district on the Hawaiian island of 
Kauai. This is a traditional, male cloistered Hindu monastery. One of Hawaii’s most tropically lush and sacred spots, the Aadheenam occupies fifty-one acres on Kauai’s eastern side, four and one-half miles from the Pacific Ocean, overlooking and bordered on its south perimeter by 1,500 feet of the Wailua River at the foot of the extinct volcano and Kauai’s 
tallest peak, Mount Waialeale. At the Church’s core is my ecclesiastical 
authority and that of my Íaiva Swâmî Sa˜gam , an order of sannyâsins 
who serve full time at Kauai Aadheenam, our international headquarters, 
âßrama  and theological seminary. This is the site of the Kailâsa Pî†ham , 
the seat of spiritual authority for this ancient guru lineage, formerly 
located in northern Sri Lanka. Here we protect the purity of the faith and 
decide matters of education, publication, innovation, theology and Church 
law . Here young brahmachârîs are prepared to eventually take their holy 
orders of sannyâsa  . From here the teachings radiate out to 250,000 read-
ers in 120 countries through H
INDUISM  TODAY, our World Outreach Mission,  
and through our local missions in over eight countries.

Our OrdainedMinisters9 ¶From Kauai Aadheenam and our other monasteries, 
the âchâryas, swâmîs, yogî s and sâdhakas assist me in 
overseeing the worldwide teaching and publications of 
the Church and in guiding its membership. These ordained monastic min-
isters are entirely supported by the Church and receive no remuneration. 
They arise at 3:45AM for a joyous, disciplined life of worship, meditation 
and selfless service, abiding by the ancient traditions of Íaivite monasti-cism under vows of purity, humility, confidence and obedience, and, for 
the swâmîs, the vow of lifetime renunciation. Of these monastics— sâd-

priests, the elders of whom have trained and sanctioned our ma†havâsis  
to perform certain rites for Church members in our temples. In this capac-
ity my monks are known as monastic priests or aadheenârchakas. In Hin-
duism, temple priests and ma†havâsis comprise two separate traditions. 
One is married; the other is unmarried and celibate. Tradition demands 
that monks not identify too closely with the priestly vocation, lest they 
become overly involved in the concerns of the public. 
Our Monks
Comprise aSâdhu Ministry11 ¶Instead, my ma†havâsis identify with and 
im merse themselves in the concerns of the over three 
million sâdhus  and swâmîs of India, a number pub-
lished in 1995 in the Washington Post  in an article about the Godmen 
of India. This is a seemingly vast number, but is actually only an aver-age of four renunciates for each of India’s 700,000 villages and count-
less cities comprising a total population of 800 million. Thus, in India, 
roughly three out of every 1,000 persons have taken up the full-time 
spiritual life. These are the holy ones, dharma’s lighthouse, the per-
petuators of the faith. India’s ratio of monks to g®ihasthas, lay per-
sons,  falls in line with the proven demographics  of successful ministry: 
of one pastor serving the spiritual needs of one hundred families, or about 300 people, in order to maintain a healthy, viable congregation.

MissionariesAnd Teachers12 ¶For the sake of those who may think of an âßrama as a 
commune accommodating all seekers, regardless of gender, 
we must reaffirm that our âßramas are strictly cloistered 
monasteries  for celibate men. We follow the aadheenam traditions of South 
India. G®ihastha  members of our fellowship live in their own homes in the 
The cosmic soul

the registered name would include the country, with the 
board of trustees  comprised solely of the Guru Mahâsan-
nidhânam and his select group of âchâryas who are the stewards of the 
international Church in the United States. A prime example is our Íaiva 
Siddhânta Church of Mauritius, registered in 1986 through an act of par-

way can we own property and establish branch monasteries . outside the 
United States. 
Ecclesiastical
HeadquartersIn Hawaii8 ¶The Church’s international headquarters  is Kauai’s 
Hindu Monastery, Kauai Aadheenam , located in the 
Wailua Homesteads district on the Hawaiian island of 
Kauai. This is a traditional, male cloistered Hindu monastery. One of Hawaii’s most tropically lush and sacred spots, the Aadheenam occupies fifty-one acres on Kauai’s eastern side, four and one-half miles from the Pacific Ocean, overlooking and bordered on its south perimeter by 1,500 feet of the Wailua River at the foot of the extinct volcano and Kauai’s 
tallest peak, Mount Waialeale. At the Church’s core is my ecclesiastical 
authority and that of my Íaiva Swâmî Sa˜gam , an order of sannyâsins 
who serve full time at Kauai Aadheenam, our international headquarters, 
âßrama  and theological seminary. This is the site of the Kailâsa Pî†ham , 
the seat of spiritual authority for this ancient guru lineage, formerly 
located in northern Sri Lanka. Here we protect the purity of the faith and 
decide matters of education, publication, innovation, theology and Church 
law . Here young brahmachârîs are prepared to eventually take their holy 
orders of sannyâsa  . From here the teachings radiate out to 250,000 read-

They arise at 3:45AM for a joyous, disciplined life of worship, meditation

The Íishya’s 
One Step to the Guru’s Nine14 ¶The covenant between guru and ßishya is based on 
the renewable, once-a-year-during-the-month-of-the- guru 
re dedi cation required of each follower. It is based on the 
ancient precept that if the ßishya takes one step  toward the guru, he in turn 
takes nine steps toward the devotee. But if the ßishya does not take that one 
crucial step in the prescribed way at the ceremonial July Guru Pûr∫imâ 
rededication, the guru withdraws his prâ∫ic energies, knowing that all 
impetus must come from inside the devotee’s heart and soul. Sûtra 246 states: 
“My followers shall seek the satguru’s blessings, act in harmony with his 
will, trust in his supreme wisdom, seek refuge in his grace, and rush for-ward to rededicate themselves yearly during the month of the guru. Aum.”  
The Pitfalls
Of the “Lenient”Approach15 ¶The alternate motivation, which is abhorrent to the 
tradition, is for the individual to draw the guru  out into 
worldliness to satisfy the devotee’s whims and fancies, 
or to seek membership in the fellowship solely for the social comforts it 
provides. Proceeding in this way has been the downfall for many Hindu 
gurus and their institutions. The one-step-nine-steps, ekapâda-navapâda, 
sâdhana must be followed, because if the guru oversteps his nine, he 
enters the worldliness he formally renounced, and the family community 
begins scheduling his appointments and running his life according to 
their outer needs and mundane concerns, rather than his directing their 
life according to inner, unearthly needs. 
Detachment:
Guru Pûr∫imâRededication16 ¶The guru  traditionally does not opt to “save souls,“ 
knowing that they are in a constant state of perfection. 
Nor does he work to “hold the flock together.” He shares 
his wisdom and gives sâdhanas to those who are open and ready to 
receive. The ardent seekers need no reminder to come forward at Guru Pûr∫imâ in July each year. They look forward to the inner or outer pil-
grimage. Others who tarry are given  six months’ grace until Satguru Jay-
antî in January. Those who do not come forward after this are encouraged 
to seek out another preceptor, a swâmî, guru, yogî  or pa∫∂ita, who may be 
more lenient in his expectations.
Beware of 
PerpetualConsumers17 ¶The ma†havâsis,  as well as our family members,  are 
admonished not to stop or tarry on their San Mârga  to 
help those who—while they are being trained to help 
themselves by performing sâdhana, personal transformation through self

Nandinâtha
Lineage ofMasters22 ¶Our known spiritual history dates back 2,000 years 
through the guru lineage  of the Nandinâtha Sampradâya’s 
Kailâsa Paramparâ. But, in truth, the mission of this order 
started at the beginning of time. Over time it has given rise to various 
institutions to embody and disseminate its teachings. Its two most recent 
manifestations are the Íivathondan Society, founded by my satguru, Siva 
Y ogaswami, in 1935; and the Íaiva Siddhânta Church  which I founded in 
1949 with his blessings when I established the Írî Subramuniya Åßrama 
in Sri Lanka. The venerable sage proclaimed that the âßrama “will be a 
three-story building.“ That was shortly after he had initiated me into the 
ancient order of sannyâsa . Our lineage of siddhas, spiritual adepts, is a 
major stream of the Nandinâtha Sampradâya, ardent proponents of the 
ancient philosophy of monistic Íaiva Siddhânta, or Advaita Èßvaravâda. 
The Church’s 
Ten BroadObjectives 23 ¶Our order’s mission is to protect, preserve and pro-
mote the Íaivite Hindu religion as embodied in the Tamil 
culture, traditions and scriptures of South India and 
Sri Lanka. Thus, the Church is unequivocally oriented to serving those 
of Tamil descent, especially those from Sri Lanka. Y et, its membership 
is open to—and we wholeheartedly serve—seekers of all ethnic back-
grounds who wish to follow this most ancient and venerable religious and 
cultural pattern. The overall purpose of Saiva Siddhanta Church  can be 
summarized in the following ten objectives. 
1.   T o protect, preserve and promote Íaivite Hinduism, especially the 
enlightened monistic Íaiva Siddhânta philosophy, Advaita ˆßvaravâda, of 
the Nandinâtha Sampradâya’s Kailâsa Paramparâ. 
2. T o live and share with others the spiritual teachings of our lineage as 
capsulized in Dancing with Íiva, Hinduism’s Contemporary Catechism, to 
share with mankind the path which leads souls through service, worship, 
sâdhana and yoga toward God Realization . 
3. T o nurture among members a rich, rewarding and spiritually fulfilling 
extended family  life based on the traditions and culture of Íaivite Hindu-
ism, strengthening family love, inspiring security within the home and 
encouraging regular religious study and daily sâdhana. 
4. T o foster Íaivite monasticism  among those who qualify, training and 
caring for those who have dedicated their lives in selfless service to oth-

Chapter 1
Overviewers and to God, Gods and guru, encouraging all monastics to follow and 
exemplify the strict ideals and disciplines found in their vows. 
5. T o support and strengthen Íaivism by maintaining Kauai Aadheenam , 
with its San Mârga Iraivan T emple and Kadavul Koyil, as a citadel of pure, 
orthodox Íaivism , and by developing a worldwide membership with 
strong family missions . 
6. T o assemble and translate into modern English and other languages the 
sacred scriptures  of Íaivism  and to produce and publish as needed reli-
gious books, texts, audio and video  recordings, *newspapers and literature. 
7. T o raise the general awareness and commitment of all Hindus toward 
their religion, educating them in the depth and beauty of the planet’s old-
est faith, through the World Outreach Mission  by distributing H INDUISM  
TODAY and other religious literature, promoting the sharing of knowledge 
and resources among Hindus of all sects. 
8. T o generate international interest and support, through the Hindu Heri-
tage Endowment,  for Hinduism’s diverse institutions, such as temples, soci-
eties, schools and the Church’s own missions, so that these institutions and 
the religion they protect will continue to flourish. 
9. T o develop services and leadership among local communities by foster-
ing family ministry, Íaivite monasticism and the Íaivite priesthoods . 
10. T o foster international alliances with organizations of all sects of Hin-
duism based on the doctrine of Hindu solidarity, with the objective of pro-
viding a firm foundation for the Sanâtana Dharma to persist in the future 
with the same potency which has made it the world’s spiritual leader and 
guide for thousands of years. 
Local Family
Societies orMissions24 ¶Family members gather in homes in sacred fellow-
ship to participate in the fulfillment of the  ten Church 
objectives. Each of these family groups is known as a 
Church mission. They foster satsa˜ga, prayer and hymn singing, reading 
of scripture, selfless service and the distribution of religious literature. 
Within these missions , families work together to generate activities for 
youth, men, women and children year after year. They seek in every way 
to make their spiritual life a vital force in the community at large by set-ting new standards in traditional dress, music, philosophy and protocol. 
Inwardly they seek to propel each and every one onward along the path 
toward God as they perform sâdhana,  dance with Íiva, live with Íiva and 
merge with Íiva. The focus of their seva  is the fulfillment of the goals 
established by the Guru Mahâsannidhânam of Kauai Aadheenam.
He is Brahmâ. 
He is Íiva. He is Indra. He is the immutable, the supreme, the self-luminous. He is Vish∫u. He is life. He is time. He is the fire, and He is the moon.

OverviewSansk®it , the universal religious language of Hinduism, is used for our 
sacred liturgy, in pûjâ for both the temple and the home and for a multi-
tude of sacred mantras to bless every important occasion. Sansk®it also 
provides many important terms both in our Church structure and our philosophical teachings, as it is the original language of our Veda s and 
Ågamas . These terms are easily absorbed into other languages—such as 
Hindi, Tamil, Kannâda, Malay, German and French. Íiva’s language, Shum , 
is used in daily guided meditations and as a supplementary tool for com-
munication within our monasteries to aid in maintaining a contempla-

Sansk®it as their language of ritual worship, Shum as their language of 
meditation, and Tyaf  as their script for offering prayers to the Gods and

The Central
Importance Of Temples28 ¶The Íaiva temple  is the center of Íaiva life, possess-
ing a ray of spiritual energy connecting it to the celestial 
worlds. Our members have always been encouraged to take 
full advantage of Íaiva temples. Sûtras 293-295 of Living with Íiva explain: 
“My devotees wisely settle  in areas where Ga∫eßa, Murugan or Íiva temples 
exist for their frequent pilgrimage, worship and spiritual security. None 
should live farther than a day’s journey from such sacred sanctuaries. 
Aum. My devotees hold as most sacred and pilgrimage  to each at least once:

abodes, His five elemental temples and the Madurai Meenakshi citadel. 
Aum. My devotees all revere and pilgrimage to Nallur and Lord Murugan’s 
six South Indian temples, Ga∫eßa’s many temples and shrines, especially 
Kumbalavalai, and the holy samâdhi shrines of our lineage. Aum Nama˙ 
Íivâya.” Sûtra 260 adds: “My devotees worship at their home shrines, dhar-
maßâlas, Kauai Aadheenam and all Íaivite temples . They do not attend 
temples of other denominations except on pilgrimage or when required 
socially. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.” Our Íaivite Íâstras  state in verse 154: “The 
temples of Íaivism in the Satßiva Yuga were profound. Nearly everyone 
had a small image of the Lord Na†arâja in their home and in the appropri-

Monasteries:Dharmaßâlas25 ¶Dharmaßâlas are branch monasteries of Kauai Aa dhee-
nam. The land and buildings  of all dharmaßâlas  are owned, 
leased or rented solely by the parent Church. Wherever 
this is not possible, a dharmaßâla cannot be established. Each monastery 
branch is patterned after Kauai Aadheenam, maintaining the same sched-
ule and following the same protocols. All activities at mon astery branches 
are coordinated by Kauai Aadheenam through close, frequent commu-
nication with the dharmaßâla’s senior group of elders . Local family mis-
sions  are guided not by our branch monasteries, but by Kauai Aadheenam 
directly. Our monastic centers extend out from Kauai Aadheenam as one 
spiritual network . Within each monastery, our monks perform sâdhana 
and pûjâ and promote Íaiva Siddhânta through seminars for members 
and students. The primary forums for teaching are periodic youth retreats  
organized with the assistance of nearby fellowship missions. Family mem-
bers gather regularly at specified areas of branch monasteries for worship, 
satsa˜ga and karma yoga.  When a dharmaßâla  ceases to fulfill its func-
tion, it becomes the duty of the Church stewards to consider selling the 
property and reassigning the monks to other centers. 
Monastery/
FamilyRelationship26 ¶Our Íaivite Íâstras,  verse 44, foretold a unique syn-
ergism between the monasteries and the family missions: 
“There was a great feeling of ’There is nothing happening 
here.‘ The ßakti was strong and fulfilled its purpose. The dalingm [family 
members] began to send their sons  to the monastery well-trained, as well 
as assume their position in training young men of other families. Their daughters were kept virgins until marriage, as were their sons, and a new 
Íaivite culture began to bloom surrounding each monastery as the ßakti 
more and more fulfilled its purpose of stabilizing the intensity of Íaivism 
in the minds of the dalingm and surrounding community. Even other reli-
gions, such as Buddhism, began to flourish in the ßakti radiations from the 
Íaivite monasteries.“

but with the proviso that this liturgy would be passed on 
only to monastics under vows and not to members of the 
lay community. This covenant with the Archaka Sa˜gam, which extended 
themselves beyond the bounds of tradition in honor to our lineage, has to this day been strictly observed, as reflected in sûtra 292: “My initiated 
devotees perform the  Íaiva âtmârtha pûjâ,  but only in home shrines, not 
in temples. Unless formally, traditionally authorized, they are prohibited 
to learn, teach or perform the  parârtha  temple pûjâ. Aum.”  Sûtra 350 adds 
that if a monastic does not renew his vows or is dismissed he is forbidden to perform or teach the Parârtha Pûjâ thenceforth. 
Valued is the
Inner GlowNot Outer Show33 ¶As explained in our Íaivite Íâstras, verses 233-236, 
“The ceremonies in the temples were basic and simple. 
There was no effort made through the years to make the 
ceremony complex or complicated. In fact, the stress was for simplicity. 
Rather than the emphasis being on the outer form of pûjâ , the natyam  
stressed their personal inner attitudes and preparation prior to the time 
of holy worship. The brâhmins [monastery priests] set the pattern for all 
ceremonies, and it was followed throughout all monasteries, temples and 
shrines, right into the dalingm  home. It was the attitude in which the 
ceremony was performed that was the important thing to be observed, for 
this attitude opened the channels to pull through the greater darßana flow 
from deep within the transcendental bodies of the devotee. In performing 
the ceremony, the test was to become as nothing—transparent and with 
head shining in inner light . If there was a semblance of physicalness, the 
senior minority would have the Umâdeva call this to the attention of the 
devotee, for this transparency of the person was the most important thing 
in pûjâ . There were pûjâs  given for various different reasons. Each one was 
predominantly the same. For the more complex and complicated pûjâ, the 
Íaivites traveled to the Holy Land of India and visited the temples there. 
‘Work not for outer show, but the inner glow.’ Sometimes Indian brâhmins 
in their state of brahmacharya visited the temples and conducted pûjâ, but 
always in the same spirit of transparency.” V erse 248 adds, “The natyam and 
sâdhaka were well aware that all pûjâ  and ceremonies conducted within 
the Íaiva Siddhânta Y oga Order were for the purpose of seeking the aid 
and cooperation of transcendental beings, which through their service

how they are being raised, so they do not go astray. This training enriches 
family life by enabling young men to help maintain their home shrine as a 
true extension of the temple, a radiant home of the Gods and a refuge from 
worldly forces. This provides the skills families need to fulfill sûtra 291: 
“ All my devotees must have an absolutely breathtaking home shrine, used 
soely for meditation and worship of  Íivali˜ga, Na†arâja, Murugan, Ga∫eßa 
and the satguru's tiruvadi . This is the home’s most beautiful room. Aum.”

ÍivâchâryaPriesthoods30 ¶As stated in sûtra 258: “My Church honors our 
 ma†havâsis  as its official priesthood. For  samskâras  and 
special  festivals we may engage closely devoted Tamil 
priests, as well as hereditary Íivâ   châr  yas, who preside at all temple conse-
crations. Aum.” Here we are referring specifically to the Ådißaivas, a hered-
itary order of priests, today consisting of several thousand families, dating 
back thousands of years and extolled in the Íaiva Ågama  scriptures as 
the only ones to enter the Íiva sanctum in performance of certain sacred 
rites. As of 1995, we rely more and more on the Íivâchâryas for the perfor-
mance of temple ceremonies, including the essential sacraments , includ-
ing nâma kara∫a (name giving), annaprâßana (first feeding), kar∫avedha 
(ear-boring), vidyârambha (beginning of learning), vivâha (marriage) and 
an tyesh†i (funeral), as well as the vrâtyastoma, the purification rite to wel-
come back into the Hindu community anyone who has previously strayed 
from the fold. The Íivâchâryas are also empowered to administer the vari-
ous vratas of our Church, including brahmacharya (celibacy), ßâkâhâra 
(vegetarian), daßama bhâga (tithing), and paramparâ (spiritual lineage), 
as well as the nâmakara∫a saμskâra  for adoptives or converts to formally 
accept them into the faith.
About the 
ParârthaPûjâ31 ¶Due to the Adißaivas’ gracious sanction and training 
of my monks, Kauai Aadheenam and its dharmaßâlas have 
through the past fifteen years  provided instruction in the 
traditional Ågamic temple pûjâ, called Íaiva Parârtha Pûjâ , to monastics 
who have advanced to the level of the postulant natyam, living under the 
four vows of purity, obedience, humility and confidence. This pûjâ was 
originally taught to our senior swâmîs in the mid-1980s by two expert 
priests —Írî Kumarswâmî Gurukal and Írî Shanmuga Gurukal—sent from 
India to Hawaii for this purpose by Írî Íivasâmbamûrthi Íivâchârya, head

 ma†havâsis  as its official priesthood. For  samskâras  and 
special  festivals we may engage closely devoted Tamil 
priests, as well as hereditary Íivâ   châr  yas, who preside at all temple conse-
crations. Aum.” Here we are referring specifically to the Ådißaivas, a hered-
itary order of priests, today consisting of several thousand families, dating 
back thousands of years and extolled in the Íaiva Ågama  scriptures as 
the only ones to enter the Íiva sanctum in performance of certain sacred 
rites. As of 1995, we rely more and more on the Íivâchâryas for the perfor-
mance of temple ceremonies, including the essential sacraments , includ-
ing nâma kara∫a (name giving), annaprâßana (first feeding), kar∫avedha 
(ear-boring), vidyârambha (beginning of learning), vivâha (marriage) and 
an tyesh†i (funeral), as well as the vrâtyastoma, the purification rite to wel-
come back into the Hindu community anyone who has previously strayed 
from the fold. The Íivâchâryas are also empowered to administer the vari-
ous vratas of our Church, including brahmacharya (celibacy), ßâkâhâra 
(vegetarian), daßama bhâga (tithing), and paramparâ (spiritual lineage), 
as well as the nâmakara∫a saμskâra  for adoptives or converts to formally 
accept them into the faith.
About the 
ParârthaPûjâ31 ¶Due to the Adißaivas’ gracious sanction and training 
of my monks, Kauai Aadheenam and its dharmaßâlas have 
through the past fifteen years  provided instruction in the 
traditional Ågamic temple pûjâ, called Íaiva Parârtha Pûjâ , to monastics 
who have advanced to the level of the postulant natyam, living under the 
four vows of purity, obedience, humility and confidence. This pûjâ was 
originally taught to our senior swâmîs in the mid-1980s by two expert 
priests —Írî Kumarswâmî Gurukal and Írî Shanmuga Gurukal—sent from 
India to Hawaii for this purpose by Írî Íivasâmbamûrthi Íivâchârya, head

descended from those holy mountains. In South India, he initiated Kadait-

OverviewKadaitswâmî
Siddha fromBangalore40 ¶A few years later, farther south, a high court judge sat 
at the end of a trial, faced with the duty to pass a sentence of death on a convicted murderer. The man was guilty, but 
the judge refused to fatally condemn a fellow human being. Instead, he left the bench, quit the law and renounced the world. He became a wandering 
monk. In time he met the ‰ishi and was initiated into the inner teachings. 
Eventually he sett led in Sri Lanka’s port city of Jaffna. It was around 1860. 
He had no home, no âßrama or yoga school. He could be found walking 
in the marketplace, speaking of man’s oneness with God Íiva and taking 
his meals with common folks. The people called him Kadaitswâmî , the 
“Marketplace Swâmî.” One day Kadaitswâmî was invited for lunch at the 
home of a devout but poor family. With little food in the house and not 
wanting to offend a great soul, the wife did the unthinkable—she sold 
her cherished gold wedding necklace to buy provisions. When the meal 
was finished, the swâmî asked her to bring a piece of iron . A rusty old 
rod was found. Kadaitswâmî took it aside, spat on it and handed it back. It had turned to gold! The family became wealthy coconut oil merchants, 
though it is said they never sold the golden rod.

rich. In fact, most thought him a vagrant, and mad in the bargain. He 
wore disheveled clothing and preferred to be alone. At age nineteen, Chel-

of Jaffna’s now famous Nallur T emple—that is when he was not walking

admitting that there was “another.” He would puzzle passersby by asking questions like “Did you know that I am the King of kings?” “Did anyone 
tell you that all the money  in all the banks in the world is mine?” Chel-
lappaswâmî was strict with himself, especially about food. He cooked his 
own meals—simple affairs of boiled rice and dal. His favorite curry was eggplant, for which he would sometimes walk ten miles to the market to 
get fresh and ten miles back. Never would he allow base desire to well 
up. If it did, if his mouth would so much as water at the smell of a hard-
earned curry, he would chide himself, “So, you want this tasty food that 
much, do you?” Laughing aloud he would pick up the clay cooking pots 
and break them on the ground. Then he would meditate on greater things

Mystic ‰ishi 
From theHimâlayas39 ¶One afternoon sometime in the mid-1800s a white-
haired man happened into a tea shop near Bangalore in 
central South India. He was a stranger, probably from the 
Himâlayan crown of India. He sat at a wooden table and took his tea. 
When the time came for the shop to close, the owner found the man had 
entered a state of contemplation so complete that he could not be aroused. 
Besides, it is considered improper to disturb a meditator. So he was left 
alone. Opening the shop early the next day, the shopkeeper discovered the 
yogi seated in perfect stillness, filling the room with a palpable sanctity. 
He did not move from that spot for seven years, nor did he speak. The shop 
closed. Villagers turned it into a shrine frequented by the crowds who 
wanted darßana, or “sight,” of this remarkable being. Many came with 
problems, the kind people everywhere have—a new job, grandmother’s 
health, daughter’s marriage. T o their amazement, answers always came. 
Sometimes in dreams. Sometimes a piece of paper would materialize in 
the air above the saint and float gently to the ground. On it would be 
written exactly what they needed. One day, as suddenly as he had come, 
the ®ishi emerged from his divine state, got up and left the shop, never to 
return. He was the first modern-day satguru  in this lineage and is known 
as the “‰ishi from the Himâlayas .”

him to carry the ancient Nâtha teachings back to the West. The event was

Siddhi: toChange Lives44 ¶Sivaya Subramuniyaswami  is now the living suc-
cessor  of the venerable sage and the satguru of the Tamil 
Íaivite Hindu people of Sri Lanka, who now reside in 
many countries of the world. He lives on a remote Hawaiian island where 
he has built a Íaivite monastery-temple complex. Here, in 1995, his eleven 
swâmîs and numerous other monks work full-time to strengthen all four 
sects of Hinduism. Gurudeva, as he is affectionately known, personally 
guides the spiritual life of each devotee, dedicated souls who have set 
upon the traditional inner path, and seek—as he and his guru and his 
guru’s guru  once did—to know thy Self and see God everywhere. His is the 
greatest magic  of all—transforming people’s lives through changing their 
consciousness. Gurudeva publishes the international news journal H INDU-
ISM TODAY , printed or distributed each month in nearly a dozen nations. 
His discourses have inspired many books and courses, most importantly 
Dancing with Íiva, Hinduism’s Contemporary Catechism— a 1,008-page 
illustrated sourcebook safeguarding India’s timeless ways and wisdom, 
and The Master Course, Part One of which is Íaivite Hindu Religion,  a 
graded course for children age 7 to 15. In 1986, New Delhi’s World Coun-
cil of Religion named him one of five modern-day Jagadâchârya s, world 
teachers, for his international efforts in promoting a Hindu renaissance for 
half a century. The Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders 
for Human Survival chose Subramuniyaswami as a Hindu representative 
at its remarkable conferences. At Oxford in 1988, Moscow in 1990 and Rio de Janiero in 1992, he joined religious, political and scientific leaders from all countries to discuss privately, for the first time in history, the future of human life on this planet. At Chicago’s historic centenary Parliament of the World’s Religions in September of 1993, Subramuniyaswami was elected as one of three presidents to represent Hinduism at the prestigious assembly of 25 men and women voicing the needs of world faiths.

The MasterOf Sri Lanka42 ¶One morning a pilgrim w as walking by the temple 
where Chellappaswâmî lived. Suddenly, the sage laughed, 
calling out, “Just who do you t hink you are?” It was a 
seemingly innocuous query, but somehow it went d eep into the heart, 
then deeper and deeper. Later the 35-year-old man left all worldly life and 
joined Chellappan as his disciple. This was Sage Y ogaswâmî  (1872–1964), 
who wrote many verses recounting that meeting: “I saw my guru at Nal-
lur T emple. ‘Hey! Who are you?’ he challenged me. I saw darkness all-sur-
rounding and could not comprehend his meaning. As I stood perplexed, 
he looked at me with kindness, and the mâyâ that was tormenting me left 
and disappeared. He pointed above my head, and I lost all consciousness of body and stood there in amazement. He then spoke of the essence of 
V edânta, that my fear might vanish. ‘It is as it is. Who knows? Grasp well 
the meaning of these words,’ said he. Everything disappeared and by the 
grace of my guru, who has no one to compare with him, I re mained still, 
with no one to compare with me.” 
A Short Sketch
About Me,By My Monks43 ¶In 1947 a 20-year-old American  sailed from San Fran-
cisco to Bombay in search of his guru. His cabin on the 
ship was directly over the engine room. It was his habit to 
meditate long hours each day alone in his room. One morning his contem-
plation was particularly deep, and as he returned to normal consciousness 
the mechanical roar of the engines became annoying, then grating, then 
unbearable. In his mind he spontaneously commanded the noise to “Stop!” 
The engines immediately halted, and the ship drifted quietly for two days 
before the voyage was resumed. Arriving in India, the youth traveled south by train. Crossing the straits to Sri Lanka, he found himself among Bud-
dhist and Hindu mystics. His urge to realize God fully grew irresistibly 
intense. Entering the dense jungles southeast of Colombo , he settl ed in the 
famed Caves of Jalani, vowing to fast and meditate until he attained the 
ultimate illumination. An Islamic mystic from a nearby mosque observed 
the young man disciplining himself and growing thinner as he meditated

Our Greatest
Siddhi: toChange Lives44 ¶Sivaya Subramuniyaswami  is now the living suc-
cessor  of the venerable sage and the satguru of the Tamil 
Íaivite Hindu people of Sri Lanka, who now reside in 
many countries of the world. He lives on a remote Hawaiian island where 
he has built a Íaivite monastery-temple complex. Here, in 1995, his eleven 
swâmîs and numerous other monks work full-time to strengthen all four 
sects of Hinduism. Gurudeva, as he is affectionately known, personally 
guides the spiritual life of each devotee, dedicated souls who have set 
upon the traditional inner path, and seek—as he and his guru and his 
guru’s guru  once did—to know thy Self and see God everywhere. His is the 
greatest magic  of all—transforming people’s lives through changing their 
consciousness. Gurudeva publishes the international news journal H INDU-
ISM TODAY , printed or distributed each month in nearly a dozen nations. 
His discourses have inspired many books and courses, most importantly 
Dancing with Íiva, Hinduism’s Contemporary Catechism— a 1,008-page 
illustrated sourcebook safeguarding India’s timeless ways and wisdom, 
and The Master Course, Part One of which is Íaivite Hindu Religion,  a 
graded course for children age 7 to 15. In 1986, New Delhi’s World Coun-
cil of Religion named him one of five modern-day Jagadâchârya s, world 
teachers, for his international efforts in promoting a Hindu renaissance for 
half a century. The Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders 
for Human Survival chose Subramuniyaswami as a Hindu representative 
at its remarkable conferences. At Oxford in 1988, Moscow in 1990 and Rio de Janiero in 1992, he joined religious, political and scientific leaders from all countries to discuss privately, for the first time in history, the future of human life on this planet. At Chicago’s historic centenary Parliament of the World’s Religions in September of 1993, Subramuniyaswami was elected as one of three presidents to represent Hinduism at the prestigious assembly of 25 men and women voicing the needs of world faiths.

Yogaswâmî,
The MasterOf Sri Lanka42 ¶One morning a pilgrim w as walking by the temple 
where Chellappaswâmî lived. Suddenly, the sage laughed, 
calling out, “Just who do you t hink you are?” It was a 
seemingly innocuous query, but somehow it went d eep into the heart, 
then deeper and deeper. Later the 35-year-old man left all worldly life and 
joined Chellappan as his disciple. This was Sage Y ogaswâmî  (1872–1964), 
who wrote many verses recounting that meeting: “I saw my guru at Nal-
lur T emple. ‘Hey! Who are you?’ he challenged me. I saw darkness all-sur-
rounding and could not comprehend his meaning. As I stood perplexed, 
he looked at me with kindness, and the mâyâ that was tormenting me left 
and disappeared. He pointed above my head, and I lost all consciousness of body and stood there in amazement. He then spoke of the essence of 
V edânta, that my fear might vanish. ‘It is as it is. Who knows? Grasp well 
the meaning of these words,’ said he. Everything disappeared and by the 
grace of my guru, who has no one to compare with him, I re mained still, 
with no one to compare with me.” 
A Short Sketch
About Me,By My Monks43 ¶In 1947 a 20-year-old American  sailed from San Fran-
cisco to Bombay in search of his guru. His cabin on the 
ship was directly over the engine room. It was his habit to 
meditate long hours each day alone in his room. One morning his contem-
plation was particularly deep, and as he returned to normal consciousness 
the mechanical roar of the engines became annoying, then grating, then 
unbearable. In his mind he spontaneously commanded the noise to “Stop!” 
The engines immediately halted, and the ship drifted quietly for two days 
before the voyage was resumed. Arriving in India, the youth traveled south by train. Crossing the straits to Sri Lanka, he found himself among Bud-
dhist and Hindu mystics. His urge to realize God fully grew irresistibly 
intense. Entering the dense jungles southeast of Colombo , he settl ed in the 
famed Caves of Jalani, vowing to fast and meditate until he attained the 
ultimate illumination. An Islamic mystic from a nearby mosque observed 
the young man disciplining himself and growing thinner as he meditated 
longer and longer. One day the Muslim was amazed to see a giant snake 
slither across the lap of the yogî, who had lost body consciousness. Finally, 
the youth broke through the various wheels of consciousness, or chakras , 
into full enlightenment, beyond time, beyond form, beyond space. Months 
later, the youth was taken to Sage Y ogaswâmî’s humble hut in the North.

I. Our Creed:
Íaiva ÍraddhâDhâra∫â47 ¶A creed  is an authoritative formulation of the beliefs 
of a religion, of religious communities and, by extension, of individuals. Historically, creeds have developed when a 
religion is transmitted from one culture to another. Until then, the reli-
gious beliefs are fully contained within the culture and taught to children 
as a natural part of growing up. Creeds serve to maintain continuity and 
purity of the original, verbally expressed doctrines, and in giving strength 
and guidelines to individuals seeking to understand life and religion. The 
twelve beliefs of our Íaivite Creed  are as follows. 
1. THE FIRST BELIEF, GOD’S UNMANIFEST REALITY 
Íiva’s followers all believe that Lord Íiva is God, whose Absolute Being, 
Paraßiva, transcends time, form and space. The yogî silently exclaims, “It 
is not this. It is not that.” Y ea, such an inscrutable God is God Íiva. Aum. 
2. THE SECOND BELIEF, GOD’S MANIFEST NATURE OF ALL-PERV ADING LOVE  
Íiva’s followers all believe that Lord Íiva is God, whose immanent nature of 
love, Parâßakti, is the substratum, primal substance or pure consciousness 
flowing through all form as energy, existence, knowledge and bliss. Aum. 
3. THE THIRD BELIEF, GOD AS PERSONAL LORD AND CREATOR OF ALL
Íiva’s followers all believe that Lord Íiva is God, whose immanent nature 
is the Primal Soul, Supreme Mahâdeva, Parameßvara, author of Veda s 
and Ågamas, the creator, preserver and destroyer of all that exists. Aum.

Articles of FaithII. Affirmation
Of Faith, Íaiva D®idhavâchana48 ¶Creeds are often distilled into a single simple state-
ment called an affirmation of faith  which summarizes 
the beliefs and doctrines of a religion. Ours is: “God Íiva 
is immanent Love and transcendent Reality.” Intoning the affirmation of 
faith silently or aloud, we confirm, assert and positively state our con-
viction that God is both manifest and unmanifest, both permeating the 
world and transcending it, both personal Divine Love and impersonal 
Reality. In these eight words is contained the essence of “ A Creed for 
Íaivite Hindus.” In Tamil we write it “ Anbe Sivamayam Satyame Parasi-
vam” and pronounce it “an’ bay see’va mai’ yam sat’ya may pa’ra see’ vam.” 
In Sansk®it it is “Íiva˙ sarvagatam prema param satyam para˙ Íiva˙!” 
“ Anbe Sivamayam Satyame Parasivam” is what you have when you take the 
milk from the sacred cow of religion, separate out the cream, churn that 
cream to rich butter and boil that butter into a precious few drops of ghee. 
III. Doctrines:
Íaiva ÍraddhâDvimûlanyâya49 ¶The Church’s dual doctrines of faith  are: the enlight-
ened monistic Íaiva Siddhânta philosophy, Advaita ˆßvara-
vâda, of the Nandinâtha Sampradâya’s Kailâsa Paramparâ; 
and Hindu solidarity, Hindutva sambandha, unity in diversity among all 
denominations of Sanâtana Dharma. These two streams of consciousness are represented by the two points of our flag, Hindutva dhvaja  .
1.  THE FIRST DOCTRINE: MONISTIC THEISM, ADV AITA ˆÍV ARAV ÅDA 
The following concise statement capsulizes the first doctrine of Íaiva 
Siddhânta Church, the monistic theism  of Íaiva Siddhânta : “God Íiva 
is within all things and all things are within Him. He is the Absolute 
Reality, beyond time, space and causation; He is the Primal Soul—creator, 
preserver and destroyer of all that exists. Y et, His majestic body is seen 
and He is talked with by the ®ishis. So great is He, the Incomparable One. 
Mysteriously, He is the Creator and the Creation. He is All and within 
all. Therefore, we preach the monistic theism of Íaiva Siddhânta, ‰ishi 
Tirumular’s V edic-Ågamic theology, which encompasses pre-Ía˜karan 
V edânta and pre-Meykandar Siddhânta.”
2.  THE SECOND DOCTRINE: HINDU SOLIDARITY , HINDUTV A SAMBANDHA

or task. His rule is compassionate. His law is just. Justice is His mind. Aum. 
5.  THE FIFTH BELIEF, THE DEITY KÅRTTIKEY A 
Íiva’s followers all believe in the Mahâdeva Kârttikeya, son of Íiva-Íakti, 
whose vel of grace dissolves the bondages of ignorance. The yogî, locked in 
lotus, venerates Murugan. Thus restrain ed, his mind becomes calm. Aum. 
6.  THE SIXTH BELIEF, THE SOUL’S CREATION AND IDENTITY WITH GOD
Íiva’s followers all believe that each soul is created by Lord Íiva and is 
identical to Him, and that this identity will be fully realized by all souls 
when the bondage of â∫ava, karma  and mâyâ is removed by His grace. Aum. 
7.  THE SEVENTH BELIEF, THE GROSS, SUBTLE AND CAUSAL PLANES OF EXISTENCE
Íiva’s followers all believe in three worlds: the gross plane, where souls take 
on physical bodies; the subtle plane, where souls take on astral bodies; and the causal plane, where souls exist in their self-effulgent form. Aum. 
8.  THE EIGHTH BELIEF, KARMA, SAÂSÅRA AND LIBERATION FROM REBIRTH
Íiva’s followers all believe in the law of karma —that one must reap the 
effects of all actions he has caused—and that each soul continues to reincar-
nate until all karmas are resolved and moksha, liberation, is attained. Aum. 
9.  THE NINTH BELIEF, THE FOUR MÅRGAS, STAGES OF INNER PROGRESS
Íiva’s followers all believe that the performance of charyâ, virtuous living, 
kriyâ, temple worship, and yoga, leading to Paraßiva through the grace of the 
living satguru, is absolutely necessary to bring forth jñâna, wisdom. Aum.
10.  THE TENTH BELIEF, THE GOODNESS OF ALL
Íiva’s followers all believe there is no intrinsic evil. Evil has no source, unless 
the source of evil’s seeming be ignorance itself. They are truly compassion-
ate, knowing that ultimately there is no good or bad. All is Íiva’s will. Aum. 
11.  THE ELEVENTH BELIEF, THE ESOTERIC PURPOSE OF TEMPLE WORSHIP
Íiva’s followers all believe that religion is the harmonious working together 
of the three worlds and that this harmony can be created through temple 
worship, wherein the beings of all three worlds can communicate. Aum. 
12.  THE TWELFTH BELIEF, THE FIVE LETTERS
Íiva’s followers all believe in the Pañchâkshara Mantra, the five sacred sylla-
bles “Nama˙ Íivâya,” as Íaivism’s foremost and essential mantra. The secret 
of Nama˙ Íivâya is to hear it from the right lips at the right time. Aum.

devotees who are lacking in courage, bold assurance that they, too, can 
succeed on the Íaivite path to enlightenment and liberation from rebirth.
The initiation for the attainment of liberation can only be obtained from 
the guru. Without the help of the guru no penance could ever be helpful in 
producing the desired result. The guru teaches the pupil. The guru becomes 
the object of glory for the disciple and enhances the pupil’s dignity. Hence the disciple must have immense regard for the guru. The guru is Íiva Himself, 
and Íiva is called the guru. Whether guru or Íiva, both have been accepted 
as vidyâ. Vidyâ is not different from both of them.

He should be known as one liberated while alive. He is blessed and is of

disembodied liberation, even as the air attains the state of nonmovement.

the true, Imperishable Being is realized.

PañchaÍraddhâ51 ¶The following ßlokas constitute the minimal Hindu 
beliefs. By teaching  these to sons and daughters, parents 
worldwide pass on the Sanâtana Dharma to their chil-
dren. All members vow to strengthen each and every nuclear, joint and extended family of the fellowship by bringing the five essential Hindu 
precepts, Pañcha Íraddhâ, into action in daily life. 
1.   THE FIRST PRECEPT: SARV A BRAHMAN, GOD IS ALL IN ALL
The dear children are taught of one Supreme Being, all-pervasive, tran-
scendent, creator, preserver, destroyer, manifesting in various forms, wor-shiped in all religions by many names, the immortal Self in all. They learn 
to be tolerant, knowing the soul’s divinity and the unity of all mankind. 
2.   THE SECOND PRECEPT: MANDIRA, HOLY TEMPLES
The dear children are taught that God, other divine beings and highly 
evolved souls exist in unseen worlds. They learn to be devoted, know-
ing that temple worship , fire-ceremonies, sacraments and devotionals 
open channels for loving blessings, help and guidance from these beings. 
3.   THE THIRD PRECEPT: THE LAW OF KARMA, COSMIC JUSTICE
The dear children are taught of karma , the divine law of cause and effect 
by which every thought, word and deed justly returns to them in this or 
a future life. They learn to be compassionate, knowing that each experi-ence, good or bad, is the self-created reward of prior expressions of free will. 
4.   THE FOURTH PRECEPT: SAÂSÅRA-MOKSHA, TRANSMIGRATION AND LIBERATION
The dear children are taught that souls experience righteousness, wealth 
and pleasure in many births, while maturing spiritually. They learn 
Page 26
Chapter 3
Articles of Faithto be fearless, knowing that all souls, without exception, will ultimate-
ly attain Self Realization, liberation  from rebirth and union with God. 
5.   THE FIFTH PRECEPT: VEDAS AND THE GURU, SCRIPTURE AND PRECEPTOR
The dear children are taught that God revealed the Veda s and Ågamas, 
which contain the eternal truths. They learn to be obedient, following 
the precepts of these sacred scriptures and awakened satgurus , whose 
guidance is absolutely essential for spiritual progress and enlightenment. 
About the 
FollowingChapter52 ¶ In the following chapter, we see how the essential 
Íaivite beliefs manifest in actions that weave uplifting pat-
terns of daily conduct. Here we find handfuls of hope for 
devotees who are lacking in courage, bold assurance that they, too, can 
succeed on the Íaivite path to enlightenment and liberation from rebirth.
The initiation for the attainment of liberation can only be obtained from 
the guru. Without the help of the guru no penance could ever be helpful in 
producing the desired result. The guru teaches the pupil. The guru becomes 
the object of glory for the disciple and enhances the pupil’s dignity. Hence the disciple must have immense regard for the guru. The guru is Íiva Himself,

not concentrated, whose mind is restless—he cannot realize the âtman, who is 
known by wisdom.
K®ish∫a Yajur Veda, KathaU 2.24. VE, 710
There are five great sacrifices, namely, the great ritual services: 
the sacrifice to all beings, sacrifice to men, sacrifice to the ancestors, sacrifice to the Gods, sacrifice to Brahman.
Íukla Yajur Veda, SataBR 11.5.6.1. VE, 394
The ten abstinences are nonviolence, truth, nonstealing, chastity, kindness, 
rectitude, forgiveness, endurance, temperance in food and purity.
Íukla Yajur Veda, TrishikhiBR U 32–33. YM, 19
They say of a man who speaks the truth, “He speaks the dharma,” 
or of a man who speaks the dharma, “he speaks the truth.” 
V erily, both these are the same thing. 
Íukla Yajur Veda, BrihadU 1.4.14. UpH, 84–85
Rescue the mind from qualities, make it pure and fix it in the heart. 
That consciousness which manifests clearly thereafter must alone be aimed at and striven for.
Devîkâlottara Ågama, JA V 5. RM, 111
O earthen vessel, strengthen me. May all beings regard me with 
friendly eyes! May I look upon all creatures with friendly eyes! With a friend’s eye may we regard each other!
Íukla Yajur Veda 36.18. VE, 342
Let the aspirant for liberation behave in an unselfish and kind way and give 
aid to all, let him undergo penance, and let him study this Ågama .

Tapas , japa, serenity, belief in God, charity, vows in Íaiva way and Siddhânta 
learning, sacrificial offerings, Íiva pûjâ and speech pure—with these ten the one 
in niyama  perfects his way. Tirumantiram 557. TM, 230
More precious than life itself is rectitude. Those who 
practice rectitude possess everything that is worthwhile. Humility, truthfulness, avoidance of killing and stealing, refraining from slandering others, absence of covetousness and so forth—these are the characteristics of a life of rectitude. Natchintanai, “The True Path.” NT, 4Page 28

Aphorisms:Mûla Sûtras56 ¶The mûla sûtras  are nine root aphorisms from the 365

ties of Íaiva Hindu living. They unmistakably distinguish 
the ardent, devout practitioner from those who are yet to make a complete, 
uncompromised twenty-four-hour-a-day commitment to a life of dharma . 
1. THE 1ST ROOT APHORISM: SËTRA 2, FOUR NOBLE GOALS
Íiva’s devotees bask contentedly in Íiva consciousness, seeing the pure 
 life energy in every person, an imal, bird, reptile, fish, insect, plant, tree 
and even mi cro    scopic intelligence as Supreme God  Íiva Himself. Aum.
2.   THE 2ND ROOT APHORISM: SËTRA 73, TRADITIONAL SURROUNDINGS
Íiva’s devotees, in their homes, endeavor to surround themselves with 
 Íaiva  images,  music and  song. In the world they may enjoy the  arts of 
other cultures but strictly avoid lower-world artistic expressions. Aum.
3. THE 3RD ROOT APHORISM: SËTRA 306, SCRIPTURAL STUDY 
My devotees avidly study The Master Course as their lifetime  sâdhana, 
allowing its mystical and practical teachings to light their inner path. In That part of Him 
which is character-ized by tamas is called 
Rudra. That part of Him which belongs to rajas is Brahmâ. 
That part of Him which belongs to sattva is Vish∫u.

9. THE FIVE SACRIFICES:  Families of all Hindu sects recognize five daily 
social and religious duties or sacrifices, yajña,  which acknowledge our 
interconnectedness with the beings of all three worlds. These are known 
as the pañcha mahâyajña, five great sacrifices to God, Gods, ancestors, 
creatures and men. 
I. Five 
Obligations:Pañcha Kriyâs54 The pañcha kriyâs, or pañcha nitya karmas, are tradi-
tional religious obligations to our religion, our extended 
family and ourselves. 
1.  THE FIRST OBLIGATION: VIRTUOUS LIVING, DHARMA
Following the laws of dharma includes observing the teachings of the Tiru-
kural , remaining celibate until marriage, obeying strî dharma  for women and 
purusha dharma  for men. Dharma is goodness in thought, word and deed. 
2.  THE SECOND OBLIGATION: WORSHIP , UPÅSANA 
Personal worship in the home shrine includes performance of pûjâ, sâdha-
na, japa  and religious study. Regular devotions in home and temple bring 
forth love of God and prepare the mind for the practice of meditation. 
3.  THE THIRD OBLIGATION: HOLY DAYS, UTSAV A
The observance of Íaivite festivals in the home and temple, including guru 
pûjâ days, brings deep communion with God during highly spiritual times 
of the year. Utsava  includes fasting and attending the temple on Mondays 
or Fridays, the weekly holy days. 
4.  THE FOURTH OBLIGATION: PILGRIMAGE, TˆRTHAY ÅTRÅ
At least once each year every Íaivite must make a pilgrimage to a holy 
place, whether near or far. This is a time when all worldly matters are set 
aside and God becomes the central and singular focus of life. 
5.  THE FIFTH OBLIGATION: SACRAMENTS, SAÂSKÅRAS
Sacraments are special ceremonies which mark our passages in life and 
sanctify these cycles of experience. They include the rites of birth, first 
feeding, learning, marriage, death, monastic vows for monks and more. 
II. The Five 
ParentingGuidelines55 ¶The pañcha ku†umba sâdhanas are five parenting 
guidelines for raising children  as strong, secure, respon-
sible, tolerant and traditional citizens.

About
LivingWith Íiva61 ¶As stated earlier, the Nandinâtha Sûtras  are from Liv-
ing with Íiva , Hinduism’s Contemporary Culture, which 
was released in 1991 to restate for my followers—many of 
whom were from northern Sri Lanka but had migrated into many coun-
tries—the laws of culture, the protocol and modes of behavior that their 
earlier Íaiva generations knew and lived so well. In the seriousness of 
their search, my devotees were asking for advice and guidance as to how they should apply our ancient traditions in contemporary times. At that trying time, these 365 Nandinâtha Sûtras  came forth as a boon from the 
Gods. Now, four years later, these aphorisms are well established and 
known throughout the world, and I ask that all followers study them  and 
adjust their lives accordingly. Indeed, these terse quatrains embody our 
Articles of Conduct and more. T o adjust one’s life to their wisdom is the 
discipline toward being able to come close to and finally live with Íiva in all dimensions of being.
The Angelic
Guides ofOur Sûtras62 ¶We must remember that each of the Nandinâtha 
Sûtras  is administered by a powerful deva in the Pretaloka , 
and these 365 devas  gather regularly in conclave to admin-
istrate all 365. This inner band of devonic helpers is adamant that a new 
culture should be revived from the old, that wrongs be righted and peace-
ful tranquility prevail in all homes in the new society of all tomorrows. Not only fellowship members, but all who have been drawn to Living with 
Íiva,  come under the gentle jurisdiction of the three hundred plus sixty-
five sûtra devas . Some ßishyas have reported feeling someone watching 
them when they were not sûtra perfect, as through a hidden video camera. 
Our answer is that it may be their own conscience, for the Íaivite Íâstras  Everywhere is the 
Holy Form. Everywhere is Íiva-Íakti. Everywhere is Chidambaram; Everywhere is Divine Dance.

VII: The Niyamas: 
Religious Practices60 ¶The second of râja yoga’s  eight limbs is  niyama, 
literally, “to unleash” or “practice.” These are the basic 
religious practices, again, not only for yogîs, but for all 
devotees seeking to live as spiritual beings on this earth, abiding in the 
wholesome, abiding consciousness of our soul nature, close to our supreme 
God Íiva’s holy feet. The niyamas  encourage the active expression of soul

About the 
Following Chapter65 ¶In the next chapter, we visualize the many levels of 
association of the grand body of Íaiva Siddhânta Church.
In vain the foolish man accumulates food. I tell you, truly, 
it will be his downfall! He gathers to himself neither friend nor comrade. 
Alone he eats; alone he sits in sin. The ploughshare cleaving the soil 
helps satisfy hunger. The traveler, using his legs, achieves his goal. 
The priest who speaks surpasses the one who is silent. The friend who gives is better than the miser.
‰ig Veda 10.117. 6–7. VE, 851
Easy for all to offer in worship a green leaf to the Lord. Easy for all 
to give a mouthful to the cow. Easy for all to give a handful when 
sitting down to eat. Easy for all to speak pleasant words to others.
Tirumantiram 252. TM, 201
Nonviolence is all the offerings. Renunciation is the priestly honorarium. The 
final purification is death. Thus all the Divinities are established in this body
K®ish∫a Yajur Veda, PranaU 46–8. VE, 413–14
If we have injured space, the earth or heaven, 
or if we have offended mother or father, from that 
may Agni, fire of the house, absolve us and 
guide us safely to the world of goodness. 
Atharva Veda 6.120.1. VE, 636From Him, also, 
are born the Gods, in manifold ways, the celestials, men, cattle, birds, the in-breath and the out-breath, rice and barley, austerity, faith, truth, chastity and the law.
ATHARV A VEDA,
MUNDU 2.1.7 . UPR, 681clearly explain that though the devas  have the ability to oversee earthly 
activities through the psychic screen, they do not spy on us, nor watch our every move. They keep a detached overview, relying on us to make our own corrections, coming forward to help only when asked.
VIII: The Sixty-
Four Kalâs, OrCultural Arts63 ¶As stated in Dancing with Íiva, “Both girls and boys 
should be trained in the sacred V edic arts and sciences, 
including the sixty-four crafts and social skills, called 
kalâs . Boys benefit greatly when taught the profession  of their father from 
a very young age. The mother is the role model for her daughters , whom 
she raises as the mothers of future families.” The sixty-four kalâs are listed 
in chapter 24 of these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras. 
IX: Pañcha 
Mahâyajña:Five Sacrifices64 ¶The holy Veda s outline five social and religious 
duties or sacrifices, known as the pañcha mahâyajña , to 
God, Gods, ancestors, creatures and men. The Íatapata 
Brâhma∫a  (xi.5.6.1-3) explains: “There are five great sacrifices, namely, the 
great ritual services: the sacrifices to all beings, sacrifice to men, sacrifice 
to the ancestors, sacrifice to the Gods, sacrifice to Brahman.…Day by day 
a man offers sustenance to creatures; that is the sacrifice to beings. Day by day a man gives hospitality to guests, including a glass of water; that is the 
sacrifice to men. Day by day a man makes funerary offerings, including 
a glass of water; that is the sacrifice to the ancestors. Day by day a man 
makes offerings to the Gods, including wood for burning; that is the sacri-
fice to the Gods. And the sacrifice to Brahman? The sacrifice to Brahman 
consists of sacred study.“ 
1.  THE FIRST SACRIFICE: BRAHMAN Y AJÑA, HOMAGE TO TRANSCENDENTAL ÍIV A, THE SELF
Brahma yajña is accomplished through studying and teaching the Veda s 
and other sacred teachings. This sacrifice is also referred to as Veda yajña  
and ®ishi yajña.  
2.  THE SECOND SACRIFICE: DEV A Y A JÑA, HOMAGE TO GODS
Deva yajña consists in recognizing the debt due to those who guide nature, 
feeding them by pouring ghee into the sacred homa fire and giving daily 
offerings through pûjâ. For our fellowship, Brahma yajña  and deva yajña  
are embodied in sûtra 22: “Worshipers of Íiva, during their daily  sâdhana 
vigil, conduct or attend  pûjâ,  chant the Guru Mantra and 108 repetitions of 
their  mantra,  study  scripture and perform  ha†ha  yoga, concentration  and 
 meditation. Aum.” The homa fire injunction may be fulfilled by lighting 
an oil lamp in the shrine room daily. Page 40

Nonviolence is all the offerings. Renunciation is the priestly honorarium. The 
final purification is death. Thus all the Divinities are established in this body

If we have injured space, the earth or heaven, 
or if we have offended mother or father, from that 
may Agni, fire of the house, absolve us and 
guide us safely to the world of goodness. 
Atharva Veda 6.120.1. VE, 636From Him, also, 
are born the Gods, in manifold ways, the celestials, men, cattle, birds, the in-breath and the out-breath, rice and barley, austerity, faith, truth, chastity and the law.
ATHARV A VEDA,
MUNDU 2.1.7 . UPR, 681clearly explain that though the devas  have the ability to oversee earthly 
activities through the psychic screen, they do not spy on us, nor watch our every move. They keep a detached overview, relying on us to make our own corrections, coming forward to help only when asked.
VIII: The Sixty-
Four Kalâs, OrCultural Arts63 ¶As stated in Dancing with Íiva, “Both girls and boys 
should be trained in the sacred V edic arts and sciences, 
including the sixty-four crafts and social skills, called 
kalâs . Boys benefit greatly when taught the profession  of their father from 
a very young age. The mother is the role model for her daughters , whom 
she raises as the mothers of future families.” The sixty-four kalâs are listed 
in chapter 24 of these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras. 
IX: Pañcha 
Mahâyajña:Five Sacrifices64 ¶The holy Veda s outline five social and religious 
duties or sacrifices, known as the pañcha mahâyajña , to 
God, Gods, ancestors, creatures and men. The Íatapata 
Brâhma∫a  (xi.5.6.1-3) explains: “There are five great sacrifices, namely, the 
great ritual services: the sacrifices to all beings, sacrifice to men, sacrifice 
to the ancestors, sacrifice to the Gods, sacrifice to Brahman.…Day by day 
a man offers sustenance to creatures; that is the sacrifice to beings. Day by day a man gives hospitality to guests, including a glass of water; that is the 
sacrifice to men. Day by day a man makes funerary offerings, including 
a glass of water; that is the sacrifice to the ancestors. Day by day a man 
makes offerings to the Gods, including wood for burning; that is the sacri-
fice to the Gods. And the sacrifice to Brahman? The sacrifice to Brahman 
consists of sacred study.“ 
1.  THE FIRST SACRIFICE: BRAHMAN Y AJÑA, HOMAGE TO TRANSCENDENTAL ÍIV A, THE SELF
Brahma yajña is accomplished through studying and teaching the Veda s 
and other sacred teachings. This sacrifice is also referred to as Veda yajña  
and ®ishi yajña.  
2.  THE SECOND SACRIFICE: DEV A Y A JÑA, HOMAGE TO GODS
Deva yajña consists in recognizing the debt due to those who guide nature, 
feeding them by pouring ghee into the sacred homa fire and giving daily 
offerings through pûjâ. For our fellowship, Brahma yajña  and deva yajña  
are embodied in sûtra 22: “Worshipers of Íiva, during their daily  sâdhana 
vigil, conduct or attend  pûjâ,  chant the Guru Mantra and 108 repetitions of 
their  mantra,  study  scripture and perform  ha†ha  yoga, concentration  and 
 meditation. Aum.” The homa fire injunction may be fulfilled by lighting 
an oil lamp in the shrine room daily. Page 42

Hindus 
Throughoutthe W orld77 ¶The fourteenth and largest circle is the entire family 
of Hindus worldwide, nearly a billion souls of a hundred 
thousand sampradâyas. It is this group, and truth-seekers 
beyond it, that constitute the fullest extent of our global family. 
About the 
Following Chapter78 ¶We have a pilgrimage for you in the chapter to come. 
It is to our center of centers, Kauai  Aadheenam, a spectacu-
lar sanctuary resting on the 30-mile-wide island Kauai, in 
the Hawaiian Island chain, the most remote land mass on earth, far away 
from congested cities, in a real jungle, not a concrete one. Kauai Aadheen-
am is 3,800 miles from T okyo in the West, 2,750 miles from San Francisco 
in the East, 2,200 miles from Alaska in the North, 4,200 miles from Austra-
lia in the South, a mere 102 miles from the international airport in Hono-lulu and only 4.5 miles from the Pacific Ocean. Making a pilgrimage to 
Kauai’s Hindu Monastery is a life-changing experience, that is true. Many 
have testified how and why they were never, ever the same after their first 
visit and how they now see God, soul and world differently from ever 
before. The next chapter will explain our “nine realms” of nature’s forests, lakes, river, waterfalls, streams and ponds: life in an overgrown jungle, life 
fighting for life, the birds, the colorful fish and memory-provoking shrines 
and the Iraivan moksha koyil that dominates all life itself in its pristine 
glory, now alive in dreams of architects and devotees, later to manifest in 
crystalline stone. 
The hands are alike but in their work they differ. So also, 
two cows, offspring of a single mother, may yet give differing yields of milk. 
Even twins are not the same in strength, or kinsmen in bounty. 
‰ig Veda 10.117.9. VE, 851
In how many parts was He transformed when they cut the Purusha in pieces? 
What did His mouth become? What His arms, what His thighs, what His feet? 
His mouth then became the brâhma∫a, from the arms the râjanya was made, 
the vaißya from the thighs, from the feet the ßûdra came forth.These Lords who, 
it is said, on the pure path, attend to the various duties deriving from a higher realm of mâyâ are at the prow 
of the effects of the higher realm of mâyâ.

able through many sources to the non-Íaivite public. These were glorious 
years, and the years ahead are to be glorious too.” There are uncounted 
thousands of these individuals in countries around the world, attending 
satsa˜ga, communicating with missions and members, visiting our cen-
ters, meeting with us when we travel, communicating via correspondence 
and electronic mail, molding their lives around our ancient enlighten-
ment teachings. They may encounter us at a parade in Germany, a festival 
in Switzerland or a temple opening in Fiji. They may see us quickly at a 
school in London, a mandira in Durban or a koyil in Colombo. They may 
visit Kauai Aadheenam to see the Iraivan Spha†ika Íivali˜ga, or meet us at 
a conference. In this tenth circle, we include the families of our ma†havâsis  
who send cookies during the holidays, and the many people who are in 
touch by personal correspondence in dozens of nations. 
Circle 11:
Readers ofOur Books74 ¶The eleventh and next larger circle is composed of 
the dedicated readers of our religious books. They are seri-
ous about their spiritual life, eager to know more about 
dharma, having found an expression of its purest path in Loving Ga∫eßa, 
Dancing with Íiva, Living and Merging with Íiva , and our many other 
books and courses in many languages, pamphlets, posters, videos, World 
Wide Web publications, sacred art and more. There are an estimated 
100,000 in this widening circle. Central among them are lifetime H INDUISM  
TODAY subscribers, called the Renaissance Circle or Râjasa˜ga, an unusu-
ally committed and talented team of men and women in many nations.
Circle 12:
HINDUISM  
TODAY  Readers75 ¶Beyond these lies the twelfth and next largest circle, 
lovers of Sanâtana Dharma who read H INDUISM  TODAY. As of 
March 1994, there were an estimated 250,000 readers in 120 
nations. Gurus, heads of âßramas, institutions and libraries have informed 
us that as many as 25 to 100 or more people read a single issue and wear 
its pages to tatters before the next arrives. This is a community of leaders, 
followers and institutions unparalleled in the world, a diverse, well-edu-
cated, widely dispersed “family” of Hindus, along with seekers of other 
faiths who love and support, admire and follow the Hindu way, the Hindu path, the Hindu vision of One God, One World. 
Circle 13:
Distant BhaktasAnd Devotees 76 ¶ Beyond this lies the thirteenth circle, a group of peo-

Associationhear about H INDUISM  TODAY  on a local radio program, see some of us on 
a television newscast or in a local or national newsmagazine article, or 
watch a video circulating in Asian or European communities. This circle 
includes devout seekers who attend the temples, participate in the festivals 
and pilgrimage to the holy tîrthas we frequent or have helped establish in 
many countries. 
Hindus 
Throughoutthe W orld77 ¶The fourteenth and largest circle is the entire family 
of Hindus worldwide, nearly a billion souls of a hundred 
thousand sampradâyas. It is this group, and truth-seekers 
beyond it, that constitute the fullest extent of our global family. 
About the 
Following Chapter78 ¶We have a pilgrimage for you in the chapter to come. 
It is to our center of centers, Kauai  Aadheenam, a spectacu-
lar sanctuary resting on the 30-mile-wide island Kauai, in 
the Hawaiian Island chain, the most remote land mass on earth, far away 
from congested cities, in a real jungle, not a concrete one. Kauai Aadheen-
am is 3,800 miles from T okyo in the West, 2,750 miles from San Francisco 
in the East, 2,200 miles from Alaska in the North, 4,200 miles from Austra-
lia in the South, a mere 102 miles from the international airport in Hono-lulu and only 4.5 miles from the Pacific Ocean. Making a pilgrimage to 
Kauai’s Hindu Monastery is a life-changing experience, that is true. Many 
have testified how and why they were never, ever the same after their first 
visit and how they now see God, soul and world differently from ever 
before. The next chapter will explain our “nine realms” of nature’s forests, lakes, river, waterfalls, streams and ponds: life in an overgrown jungle, life 
fighting for life, the birds, the colorful fish and memory-provoking shrines 
and the Iraivan moksha koyil that dominates all life itself in its pristine 
glory, now alive in dreams of architects and devotees, later to manifest in 
crystalline stone. 
The hands are alike but in their work they differ. So also, 
two cows, offspring of a single mother, may yet give differing yields of milk. 
Even twins are not the same in strength, or kinsmen in bounty. 
‰ig Veda 10.117.9. VE, 851
In how many parts was He transformed when they cut the Purusha in pieces? 
What did His mouth become? What His arms, what His thighs, what His feet? 
His mouth then became the brâhma∫a, from the arms the râjanya was made, 
the vaißya from the thighs, from the feet the ßûdra came forth.These Lords who, 
it is said, on the pure path, attend to the various duties deriving from a higher realm of mâyâ are at the prow 
of the effects of the higher realm of mâyâ.

able through many sources to the non-Íaivite public. These were glorious 
years, and the years ahead are to be glorious too.” There are uncounted 
thousands of these individuals in countries around the world, attending 
satsa˜ga, communicating with missions and members, visiting our cen-
ters, meeting with us when we travel, communicating via correspondence 
and electronic mail, molding their lives around our ancient enlighten-
ment teachings. They may encounter us at a parade in Germany, a festival 
in Switzerland or a temple opening in Fiji. They may see us quickly at a 
school in London, a mandira in Durban or a koyil in Colombo. They may 
visit Kauai Aadheenam to see the Iraivan Spha†ika Íivali˜ga, or meet us at 
a conference. In this tenth circle, we include the families of our ma†havâsis  
who send cookies during the holidays, and the many people who are in 
touch by personal correspondence in dozens of nations. 
Circle 11:
Readers ofOur Books74 ¶The eleventh and next larger circle is composed of 
the dedicated readers of our religious books. They are seri-
ous about their spiritual life, eager to know more about 
dharma, having found an expression of its purest path in Loving Ga∫eßa, 
Dancing with Íiva, Living and Merging with Íiva , and our many other 
books and courses in many languages, pamphlets, posters, videos, World 
Wide Web publications, sacred art and more. There are an estimated 
100,000 in this widening circle. Central among them are lifetime H INDUISM  
TODAY subscribers, called the Renaissance Circle or Râjasa˜ga, an unusu-
ally committed and talented team of men and women in many nations.
Circle 12:
HINDUISM  
TODAY  Readers75 ¶Beyond these lies the twelfth and next largest circle, 
lovers of Sanâtana Dharma who read H INDUISM  TODAY. As of 
March 1994, there were an estimated 250,000 readers in 120 
nations. Gurus, heads of âßramas, institutions and libraries have informed 
us that as many as 25 to 100 or more people read a single issue and wear 
its pages to tatters before the next arrives. This is a community of leaders, 
followers and institutions unparalleled in the world, a diverse, well-edu-
cated, widely dispersed “family” of Hindus, along with seekers of other 
faiths who love and support, admire and follow the Hindu way, the Hindu path, the Hindu vision of One God, One World.

Instill in us a wholesome, happy mind, with goodwill and understanding. 
Then shall we ever delight in your friendship like cows who gladly rejoice in meadows green. This is my joyful message.
‰ig Veda 10.25.1. VE, 302
He is the never-created creator of all: He knows all. 
He is pure consciousness, the creator of time, all-powerful, all-knowing. He is the Lord of the soul and of nature and of the three conditions of nature. From Him comes the transmigration of life and liberation, bondage in time and freedom in eternity.
K®ish∫a Yajur Veda, SvetU 6.16. UpM, 96
All this universe is in the glory of God, of Íiva, the God of love. 
The heads and faces of men are His own, and He is in the hearts of all.
K®ish∫a Yajur Veda, SvetU 3.11. UpM, 90
God is, in truth, the whole universe: what was, what is and 
what beyond shall ever be. He is the God of life immortal and of all life that lives by food. His hands and feet are everywhere. He has heads and mouths everywhere. He sees all, He hears all. He is in all, and He Is.
K®ish∫a Yajur Veda, SvetU 3.15–16. UpM, 90
He is the God of forms infinite, in whose glory all things are, smaller than 
the smallest atom, and yet the creator of all, ever living in the mystery of His creation. In the vision of this God of love there is everlasting peace.
K®ish∫a Yajur Veda, SvetU 4.14. UpM, 92
Devoid of beginning, duration and ending, by nature immaculate, powerful, 
omniscient, supremely perfect—thus is Íiva spoken of in Íaivite tradition.

The path of Íiva is the proven path. It led them to Hara. 
It is the royal path that renowned souls have walked. By this path divine, the devout pervade the universe. That path do seek, enter and persevere.

Realm II:
WailuaFarm83 ¶Established in 1972 in the tradition of Hindu monas-
teries being endowed through agriculture, Wailua Farm 
is run by the full-time monastic staff with occasional 
volunteer help from family members. It provides an area of contempla-
tive service and training for young monks in carpentry and farming in the natural beauty of groves of plumeria, hibiscus, bilva, neem, curry 
leaf, fragrant vines, surinam cherry, lilikoi, native Hawaiian plant spe-
cies, ferns and more. The farm also has orchards of lime, ba nana, papaya, 
guava, orange, tangerine, jackfruit, mangosteen, fig, breadfruit and avo-
cado trees, and a large variety of vegetables such as manioc, murunkai, 
sweet potatoes, curry leaves, hot peppers, herbs, squash, chayote, beans 
and legumes, coconut trees, the famed Hawaiian taro, flower gardens  and 
one of the world’s largest collection of tropical flowers, including over 500 
species of heliconia and ginger. A small herd of Jersey and Holstein cows 
provide an abundant supply of milk, yogurt, cheese and butter for the 
monastery kitchen and ghee for cooking and temple ceremonies.

is answered is an offering traditionally given to the temple in gratitude, 
along with written appreciation in a subsequent prayer to the Divine 
Beings who performed this selfless service for the devotee. 
Realm IV :
San MârgaSanctuary89 ¶Kauai Aadheenam’s most prominent place of worship 
for members, students and sâdhana yâtrikas is the San 
Mârga Sanctuary , an extraordinary meditation tîrtha at 
the foot of the extinct volcano, Mount Waialeale. San Mârga is the straight 
path to God, through rudrâksha, neem and konrai forests, marshes, bogs 
and wild bird sanctuaries, where pheasants are protected from local 
hunters. This realm includes the Svayambhû Íivali˜ga and Agni Ma∫-
∂apam. San Mârga is entered through the Rudrâksha Meditation Forest at 
the opposite site of the 458-acre monastery land. San Mârga, the straight 
path to God, and the Svay ambhû Li˜ga area is ”the place where the world 
comes to pray,” as predicted in our Íaivite Íâstras. 
The Story
Of San Mârga’sFounding90 ¶San Mârga was established as a result of a three-fold 
vision  that came to me early one morning in 1975. I saw 
Lord Íiva walking in the meadow near the Wailua River. 
Then His face was looking into mine. Then He was seated upon a great 
stone. Astonished, I was seated on His left side. Upon reentering earthly 
consciousness, I felt certain the great stone was somewhere on our land and set about to find it. Guided from within by my satguru, I hired a 
bulldozer and instructed the driver to follow me as I walked to the north 
edge of the property that was then a tangle of buffalo grass and wild 
guava. I hacked my way through the jungle southward as the dozer cut a 
path behind me. After almost half a mile, I sat down to rest near a small 
tree. Though there was no wind, suddenly the tree’s leaves shimmered 
as if in the excitement of communication. I asked the tree, “What is your 
message?” In reply, my attention was directed to a spot just to the right of 
where I was sitting. When I pulled back the tall grass, there was a large 
rock, the self-created Li˜ga on which Lord Íiva had sat. The bulldozer’s 
trail now led exactly to the sacred stone, surrounded by five smaller boul-
ders. San Mârga, the straight or pure path to God, had been created. All

Lord Íiva’sCosmic Dance86 ¶ The ceremonies at Kauai Aadheenam are voiced in 
the Sansk®it  language according to Hindu tradition dat-
ing back six to eight thousand years. The monastic priests, 
trained under the guidance of Írî Sambamûrthi Íivâchârya of the Then 
India Archaka Sa˜gam, are from Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and North America. The one Supreme Being is adored here as Íiva, enshrined 
in the main sanctum as a 200-year-old, six-foot bronze Na†arâja, King of 
Dance. Íiva’s dance is both symbol and reality. It is the movement of cre-
ation, preservation and dissolution, the triad which taken together is the 
principle of mâyâ, God’s endless impulse, taking place within each of us, 
within every atom of the universe. We are all dancing with Íiva this very 
moment and He with us. Ultimately, we are Íiva dancing. Installed at the 
feet of Lord Kadavul Na†arâja, Parameßvara, is a special Tiru Ambala Y an-
tra  made 200 years ago by a renowned siddhar and presented to me in 
1974 by the brâhmin priests of Sri Lanka’s Tiruketeesvaram T emple. Two 
other Gods are also worshiped: Lord Ga∫eßa, the benevolent Lord of dhar-
ma and remover of obstacles, in the left shrine; and Lord Kârttikeya, the 
God of yoga and spiritual striving, in the right shrine. 
Kadavul Koyil’s
Schedule andHoly Se rvices87 ¶The main pûjâ  of the day is conducted to Lord 
Na†arâja and the spha†ika Li˜ga at 9 AM, with other pûjâs 
held every three hours. Archanas (pûjâs done in one’s 
name to invoke special guidance and blessings) are available in per-
son or by mail. Other special pûjâs may be sponsored. Holy ash, vibhûti,  
blessed before the Deity is given or sent to devotees as prasâda. Our tem-
ples perform the major saμskâras , including nâmakara∫a (name giving), 
annaprâßana (first feeding), vidyârambha (beginning of learning) and 
kar∫avedha (ear-boring). Pûjâs and sacraments are available to Hindus 
only. We also celebrate several major Íaivite festivals  each year. Kada-
vul is not a public temple, but a shrine for monastics and members, the 
spiritual nucleus of our fellowship. One day in the distant future, it was 
revealed to me in psychic vision, Kadavul will stand alone as a colorfully-painted Ågamic temple with a tall vimanam and râjagopura entrance. In 
the vision, the Aadheenam  was relocated closer to Iraivan. 
Written Prayers
Sent ThroughThe Sacred Fire88 ¶Lekhaprârtha havana  is the ancient sacrificial 
rite of burning written prayers  in the sacred fire. 
Written prayers can be offered at Kadavul T emple by 
Hindus or non-Hindus to God, Gods and devas of the inner worlds. When 
burned, these are released to their astral form in the Devaloka for the

Circles of 
Associationdevas to read and act upon. All prayers are burned confidentially and 
never read by the priests. It is traditional that no love offering be includ-
ed with prayers, which can also be mailed or  faxed. Only after a prayer 
is answered is an offering traditionally given to the temple in gratitude, 
along with written appreciation in a subsequent prayer to the Divine 
Beings who performed this selfless service for the devotee. 
Realm IV :
San MârgaSanctuary89 ¶Kauai Aadheenam’s most prominent place of worship 
for members, students and sâdhana yâtrikas is the San 
Mârga Sanctuary , an extraordinary meditation tîrtha at 
the foot of the extinct volcano, Mount Waialeale. San Mârga is the straight 
path to God, through rudrâksha, neem and konrai forests, marshes, bogs 
and wild bird sanctuaries, where pheasants are protected from local 
hunters. This realm includes the Svayambhû Íivali˜ga and Agni Ma∫-
∂apam. San Mârga is entered through the Rudrâksha Meditation Forest at 
the opposite site of the 458-acre monastery land. San Mârga, the straight 
path to God, and the Svay ambhû Li˜ga area is ”the place where the world 
comes to pray,” as predicted in our Íaivite Íâstras. 
The Story
Of San Mârga’sFounding90 ¶San Mârga was established as a result of a three-fold 
vision  that came to me early one morning in 1975. I saw 
Lord Íiva walking in the meadow near the Wailua River. 
Then His face was looking into mine. Then He was seated upon a great 
stone. Astonished, I was seated on His left side. Upon reentering earthly 
consciousness, I felt certain the great stone was somewhere on our land and set about to find it. Guided from within by my satguru, I hired a 
bulldozer and instructed the driver to follow me as I walked to the north

motto  etched in a multitude of languages. It is a magnificent shrine for 
fellowship members and devout pilgrims intent on worshiping the imma-
nent and transcendent Lord. Being a moksha temple in the center of a 
cloistered monastery, Iraivan is by no means a tourist attraction. It is a 
pu∫ya tîrtha, a sacred destination for devout pilgrims who come with this 
one goal in mind, having received permission early on and begun pre-

The Healing 
Power of Rudrâksha91¶Pilgrims begin their spiritual excursion in a small 
healing forest of Himâlayan rudrâksha  trees. Many do not 
know the obscure fact that this sacred tree, known in Eng-
lish as the Blue Marble tree , is also famous for its special wood. During 
the First World War, when airplanes became so essential to military strat-
egy, it was the white wood of this tree that was chosen for making propel-
lers, due to its qualities of torque strength. Y es, being under the rudrâksha  
trees in this magical forest has hidden, sought-after healing powers, the 
key to helping aching hearts, the salve to soothe broken hearts, yearn-
ing hearts, sad hearts and ailing hearts. Åyurvedic doctors and medical 
doctors alike agree that the seed, when placed upon the heart, regulates 
its beat. They know that the fruit is good to strengthen the heart and the 
seed when ground and mixed with certain herbs is a remedy for heart 
attacks and healing in their aftermath. Just to hug the trees themselves and to absorb their healing force takes away pain of losing a loved one. 
The tree takes all sadness into its sap, carrying it up to the tops and drop-
ping the astral tears of God Íiva. This practice has the power to balance 
your chakras , purify your aura, close the doors to the darker areas of your 
mind, open the doors to light, happiness, mirth and the ability to make 
others laugh. Hugging  the rudrâksha tree will imprint the realization that 
all the past is and was necessary for the present moment to exist. The 
blessings of Íiva through the rudrâksha seeds, leaves, bark and energies, 
open the doors of protection of the future. Carefully pick one or two, or 
three or four seeds. Take them with you to plant in a pot in your home and 
create your own tree or trees, to bring these gifts into your life and the 
lives of others, the regulation of the heart, the strengthening of the heart.

An Overview
Of KulamResponsibilities100 ¶This is a brief summary of the five kulams , fol-
lowed by a more detailed description. 
1.   LAMBODARA KULAM—TEMPLE: This family group of ma†ha-
vâsis is responsible for temple and religious services, hosting of guests, 
food preparation, health and diet, âyurveda  and jyotisha, animal care and 
general spiritual welfare of all residents, especially young monks.
2. EKADANTA KULAM—TEACHING: This family group of ma†havâsis is respon-
sible for teaching, Church and Academy management, nurture and out-
reach activities. It also coordinates innersearch pilgrimages, ma†havâsi 
travel and counseling of members and students.
3.  PILLAIY AR KULAM—FINANCE: This family group of ma†havâsis is respon-
sible for finance, investments, accounting, legal work and money manage-
ment on all levels. It takes care of our database, mailing lists, advertis-
ing, publications sales, distributions and inventories. This group is also in 
charge of community public relations. 
4. SIDDHIDATTA KULAM—BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS: This ma†havâsi family 
group, and those they hire to assist them, is responsible for the physical 
property, buildings, grounds, maintenance, construction, orchards and flower gardens.
5. GAIAPATI KULAM—PUBLICATIONS: This ma†havâsi family group is respon-
sible for the creation of the Church and its Academy’s written teachings, 
courses, books, magazines, pamphlets, press releases and other publica-
tions. It also handles video, photography, design projects, translations and 
international public relations.
As oil in sesame seeds, 
as butter in cream, as water in river beds, as fire in friction sticks, so is the âtman 
grasped in one’s own self when one searches for Him with truthful-ness and austerity.
K‰ISHIA Y AJUR VEDA,
SVETU 1.15. UPR, 718surgery. It takes away encumbrances and releases the pristine beauty of 
the soul. As pilgrims leave the San Mârga Sanctuary they are escorted 
back the way they came, along San Mârga and through the Rudrâksha Meditation Forest with a new self-image and clear understanding of the 
purpose of life on planet Earth.
The Unique
Nature of Iraivan Temple96 ¶In 1995, as we look into the future, we see Iraivan , 
fully completed, as a center where Íaivites will come 
to find the center of themselves. We will preserve it and 
maintain it so that it is the way ‰ishikesh used to be, a proper, pure, quiet 
place where devotees can go within themselves through the practice of 
râja yoga. There are very few such places left on the Earth now. Kauai’s 
Hindu monastery is one of them. It is not a place for ordinary people, curi-
osity seekers, or tourists. It is a place to which people will be drawn who 
have made themselves pure by self effort through sâdhana. I see Iraivan 
as Mount Kailâsa, or the Amarnâth Cave Ice Li˜gam, a silent citadel hid-den within a rainforest on the furthest land mass from all continents. I 
see Iraivan as a yoga citadel, a place of pilgrimage for the devout, sincere 
and dedicated. I see Iraivan as India’s message to the world on visitors’ day, when Hindus and non-Hindus alike come to admire the great artistry of the ßilpi tradition guided by the Vâstu Íâstras. I see Iraivan as a ful-
fillment of paramparâ, scripture and temple: the three pillars of Íaivism. 
This is a place where you do not have to invoke God, for God is here, for 
this is where heaven meets the earth.
Realm VIII: 
Path of theÍaivite SaintsΔ7097 ¶The Path of Tamil Íaivite Saints is on the east side 
of San Mârga. Walking the 1,300-foot-long path that winds around ponds, banyan trees and tropical plants, pilgrims 
encounter statues of select saints of Íaivism. 
Realm IX: 
Ma†havâsiVîdhu98 ¶The central monastery facility, ma†havâsi vîdhu , is 
itself one of the nine realms of upliftment, care and beau-
tification, with its Chola, Nakshatra and Pa∫∂yan Gardens, 
high-tech publication facilities, kitchen, library, offices, workshops, monks’ 
quarters, Guru T emple, Persian and Himâlayan cats, and bird aviaries 
with cockatiels, macaws and cockatoos. 
Five Divisions
Of Monastic Responsibility99 ¶There are five kulams , or monastic “family” groups, at 
Kauai Aadheenam, each overseeing specific areas of ser-
vice and responsibility. All named after Lord Ga∫eßa, they 
are as follows. Lambodara Kulam: temple sacraments, âyurvedic food prep-
aration, astrology and animals; Ekadanta Kulam: Church mission, mem-

property, buildings, grounds, maintenance, construction, orchards and flower gardens.
5. GAIAPATI KULAM—PUBLICATIONS: This ma†havâsi family group is respon-
sible for the creation of the Church and its Academy’s written teachings,

As oil in sesame seeds,

the soul. As pilgrims leave the San Mârga Sanctuary they are escorted 
back the way they came, along San Mârga and through the Rudrâksha Meditation Forest with a new self-image and clear understanding of the 
purpose of life on planet Earth.
The Unique
Nature of Iraivan Temple96 ¶In 1995, as we look into the future, we see Iraivan , 
fully completed, as a center where Íaivites will come 
to find the center of themselves. We will preserve it and 
maintain it so that it is the way ‰ishikesh used to be, a proper, pure, quiet 
place where devotees can go within themselves through the practice of 
râja yoga. There are very few such places left on the Earth now. Kauai’s 
Hindu monastery is one of them. It is not a place for ordinary people, curi-
osity seekers, or tourists. It is a place to which people will be drawn who 
have made themselves pure by self effort through sâdhana. I see Iraivan 
as Mount Kailâsa, or the Amarnâth Cave Ice Li˜gam, a silent citadel hid-den within a rainforest on the furthest land mass from all continents. I 
see Iraivan as a yoga citadel, a place of pilgrimage for the devout, sincere 
and dedicated. I see Iraivan as India’s message to the world on visitors’ day, when Hindus and non-Hindus alike come to admire the great artistry of the ßilpi tradition guided by the Vâstu Íâstras. I see Iraivan as a ful-
fillment of paramparâ, scripture and temple: the three pillars of Íaivism. 
This is a place where you do not have to invoke God, for God is here, for 
this is where heaven meets the earth.
Realm VIII: 
Path of theÍaivite SaintsΔ7097 ¶The Path of Tamil Íaivite Saints is on the east side 
of San Mârga. Walking the 1,300-foot-long path that winds around ponds, banyan trees and tropical plants, pilgrims 
encounter statues of select saints of Íaivism. 
Realm IX: 
Ma†havâsiVîdhu98 ¶The central monastery facility, ma†havâsi vîdhu , is 
itself one of the nine realms of upliftment, care and beau-
tification, with its Chola, Nakshatra and Pa∫∂yan Gardens, 
high-tech publication facilities, kitchen, library, offices, workshops, monks’ 
quarters, Guru T emple, Persian and Himâlayan cats, and bird aviaries 
with cockatiels, macaws and cockatoos. 
Five Divisions
Of Monastic Responsibility99 ¶There are five kulams , or monastic “family” groups, at 
Kauai Aadheenam, each overseeing specific areas of ser-
vice and responsibility. All named after Lord Ga∫eßa, they 
are as follows. Lambodara Kulam: temple sacraments, âyurvedic food prep-
aration, astrology and animals; Ekadanta Kulam: Church mission, mem-

Tamil and other languages, the use of mudrâs, hand gestures used in cer-
emonial rites, as well as visualization and invocation and other esoteric aspects of Hindu sacerdotalism.
2. P¨JÅ PREPARATION: Preparation for pûjâs, sacraments, homas and utsavas —
gathering  sacred wood for the homa, wrapping sacred water pots (called 
kumbha ), grinding chandana  (sandalpaste), preparing incense, bathing 
and dressing the Deity image, preparing oil lamps, etc. 
3. TEMPLE ADMINISTRATION: T emple office and management duties includ-
ing correspondence, monthly mailings, keeping a computerized database 
of devotees’ contributions and answering the telephone. T emple planning and construction and oversight. This area includes the production of some of the Church’s video presentations.
4. FESTIV ALS: Responsible for local festivals, coordinating with the local 
council on missions and other monastery kulams . 
5. HOSTING : Greeting and attending to devotees in and around the temple. 
6. HINDU ASTROLOGY: The basics of Hindu astrology , an essential area of 
knowledge for all Hindu temple priests, including horoscopy and deter-
mining auspiciousness for various occasions through the use of the Hindu 
astrological calendar, known as pañchâ˜ga. Trainees become familiar 
with and assist in the creation of astrological charts for Church members 
through the use of the Macintosh computer.
7. NURTURE OF YOUTH: Overseeing the teaching of children  of surrounding 
missions through age 25.
Lambodara
NutritionalResponsibilities103 ¶Food preparation and animal care are part of the 
ongoing nurturing of the monastics themselves, under 
the purview of the Lambodara Kulam, which is the first 
kulam established when opening a new monastery. Food preparation is 
viewed as an extension of their duties in the temple. The reason for this 
traditional understanding is that: 1) The food we eat, and the thoughts and 
feelings that go into its preparation, influences all that we do. Therefore, 
the preparation of food is a sacred duty; 2) nutrition is life, and Hinduism 
offers a wealth of knowledge, in the ancient science called âyurveda, to 
guide the culinary arts to create meals that are not only pleasing to the 
appetite but healthful to the body and mind; 3) ghee and fresh, raw milk 
are requirements for the pûjâ. In this area of the Lambodara Kulam, train-
ing and exposure is given in the following activities.
1. ÅYURVEDA : The basics of âyurveda, the Hindu “science of life,” including 
The one controller, 
the inner Self of all things, who makes His one form manifold, to the wise who perceive Him as abiding in the soul, to them is eternal bliss—to no others.

KATHAU 2.2.12. UPR, 640The Kulams
Are IntegratedAnd Interactive101 ¶Each kulam is a school and a family in itself. Train-
ing and guidance is ongoing. Each newcomer is assigned 
to a kulam. He amalgamates with the members of that 
group, young and old, and serves alongside them under the artisan’s direc-
tion. In early years a  young monk may serve in more than one kulam  
before being given a permanent kulam assignment. Each kulam  has dis-
tinct offices and shops, tools and responsibilities in playing its part in the mission of the Church. Thus, these five family groups together cre-
ate a full and complete environment for fulfilling our monastic dharma. 
Kauai’s Hindu Monastery, ideally situated on 51 acres of secluded land, is 
well endowed with modern equipment and communication devices. Each 
day at Kauai Aadheenam, before the morning meditation, the ma†havâsis 
can be heard reciting together the following affirmation : “The five kulams 
of Kauai Aadheenam pledge our existence to serve Lord Íiva selflessly and harmoniously to provide a firm foundation to meet the massive Íaiva 
karma through fulfilling our monastic dharma. We each pledge loyalty to 
the fulfillment of the kulam goals. We unanimously beseech the blessings 
of Lord Ga∫eßa for wisdom in our inner worship and foresight, so that each of our projects will be smoothly, concisel y and efficiently fulfilled. 
We dedicate our energies to dispatch our duties quickly, with the speed of 
the holy V el of Lord Muruga. We are filled and thrilled with the Cosmic 
Energy of God Siva, creatively alive, in tune with the universe and now ready to begin this day.”

priestly skills, being sacred knowledge, are conveyed only to those train-
ees who qualify, by age, background, aptitude and nature. Members of this 
kulam oversee and conduct daily liturgical ceremonies, called pûjâs, sac-
raments for individuals (such as name-giving), called saμskâras, and spe-

Ministry 
Is PerformedIn Pairs109 ¶Kauai’s Hindu Monastery, like all the Church’s mon-
asteries, is strictly cloistered and supervised. Only men 
live at the monastery. Monks do not leave the property 
except for activities approved by the head of their family group, their 
talaivar. They never  go out alone, always in two’s or larger groups. Howev-
er, if necessary a monastic may travel alone, incognito , for no longer than 
nine days, generally for the purpose of traveling from one of our monas-
teries to another or to rendezvous with a group of our monks on pilgrim-
age. Similarly, all ministry is performed in two’s, as is all social, cultural and business activity. 
These two rules are expressed in sûtra 350: “ My 
Íaiva monastics, whether in or outside the monas tery, perform ministry 
only in pairs. They never travel alone. Exceptions are made in dire emer-
gencies and for those on the nirvâ∫a sâdhaka  path. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya .” 
Sûtra 353 further defines the point at which a second monk must be pres-
ent during conversations: “ My Íaiva monastics follow the tradition of not 
hold  ing serious or lengthy private  conversations in person or by telephone 
without another monk present. Gracious, im  personal small talk in pub-
lic is, of course, allowed. Aum. ” All of the above is consistent with other 
traditional Hindu orders, who have long followed this protocol. All of the 
above also applies to guru mahâsannidhânams  now and in the future. 
Therefore, it would be an equal breach of protocol for any non-monastic 
to hold a long discussion with any monastic alone without his second 
monk, called sahayatin in Sansk®it and salingba  in Shum . This sûtra 
Here they say that 
a person consists of desires. And as is his desire, so is his will. As is his will, so is his deed. Whatever deed he does, that he will reap.

in South India, Kauai Aadheenam follows a lunar calendar. Roughly two 
days out of seven are reserved for religious disciplines, personal care, 
âßrama upkeep and beautification, study and rest. On these days, early 
rising is not required. The monastery “workday” begins at 8:00am and 
ends at 6:30pm, with a 2-hour break from 1:00 to 3:00 pm for lunch and 
nap and swimming or alternate exercise. Kulam activities resume at 3:00

Sacred CalendarThe Second
Season:Jîvana ‰itau117 ¶During Jîvana ‰itau, the rainy season, from mid-
August to mid-December, Living with Íiva: Hinduism’s 
Contemporary Culture is the primary text. The key word 
of this season is work. The colors  are rust, copper-maroon and all shades 
of red—rust for earthy preservation, copper-maroon for fulfillment and 
red for physical energy. The Aadheenam’s 60-foot flag pole flies the rust-
colored dhvaja,  symbolizing environmental care. Copper-maroon and 
all shades of red adorn our smaller flags. This is the season of honoring and showing appreciation for those in the vâ∫aprastha âßrama, life’s elder 
advisor stage. The focus is on preserving what has been created, manifest-
ing goals and fulfilling plans made in the past. Inwardly the emphasis is on direct cognition and caring for the practical details of the external 
world. Practicality is a word much used this season. In the monasteries 
and the missions, there is a big push on studying the sûtras of Living with 
Íiva and these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras . The format of the mission satsa˜ga 
changes into one that in fact helps everyone live and breathe with Lord 
Íiva through personal adjustment to the aphorisms of Living with Íiva,  
which define tradition, culture and protocol. Gurukulams  are established 
or renewed to teach the 64  kalâs  for boys and girls. All work hard to per-
fect and strengthen Íaivite culture  in the life of each member. Kulamâtâs, 
g®ihi∫îs and their daughters  should think ahead and make plans to send 
talented children to dancing, singing and art schools for special courses, 
and ponder ways to make this possible through scholarships and special 
funds. It is a time of building and repairing and caring for what has been 
built, planted or created in any realm of life. It is a physical time, of exer-
cise and exertion in the Bhûloka, a magnetic time for action and willpow-er, of finishing all jobs started since the first ®itau. On the farm, there is 
harvesting of the land’s fruits as we celebrate abundance. In the missions 
during Jîvana ‰itau, the ßishyas can form tirukuttams , and thereby visit 
students’ homes, see how they live and meet their families.
Special 
Sâdhanas of theSecond Season118 ¶The family sâdhana is meditating upon a chapter 
each day of Living with Íiva  and learn  ing and singing 
Natchintanai , the holy songs of our paramparâ, in all lan-
guages, both outwardly and inwardly each day without fail . This is the 
time when vî∫â, tambûrâ  and the drums are most in vogue. In Sansk®it, 
the central chants are perfected . This season of preservation is also a time 
to bring up to date vratas  and sâdhanas  that have been neglected or total-
ly ignored. All seek to preserve the integrity of their commitments to the 
According as one acts, 
so does he become. One becomes virtuous by virtuous action, bad by bad action.
ÍUKLA Y AJUR VEDA,
BRIHADU 4.4.5. UPH, 140Íaiva Dharma Íâstras  are studied; and any needed additions in supple-
mentary manuals, representing new growth, are made. The practical focus 
is completion of unfinished projects. Secular holidays to observe among 
the families include Mother’s Day in May, Father’s Day in June and Grand-
parent’s Day in August. In the monastery the monks begin their annual 31-
day âyurvedic herbal cleansing. Intensive cleaning of monastery buildings 
and grounds takes place. The special dietary adjustments for the season come into effect and new menus are established. New clothing is issued and old garments mended. This season of harvest and new growth is also 
the time to review and reestablish picking and planting routines for the 
gardens. It is a time for ordering seeds and plants for the year, of planting 
trees, fragrant vines and the annual crop. Review is made for scheduling the care of all nine realms of the Aadheenam’s 51 acres. Kadavul temple

the adjacent grounds receive special, abundant attention. Karma yogîs  are 
invited to help in this and other areas with planting and weeding, digging, 
fertilizing, fence repair and more.
The Sâdhanas 
of the First Season115 ¶The daily sâdhana is the Íivachaitanya Pañcha-
tantra : experiencing nâda, jyoti, prâ∫a, ßakti and darßana. 
In Sansk®it, it is a time of learning new ßlokas and man-
tras. In the family community, praßnottara satsa˜ga  is held for one and 
all to attend. Families plan for their annual pilgrimage. Shrine rooms are 
renewed and redecorated for the year, and the clothing of all is renewed 
in the Hindu style of the current fashion. It is a time of doing things for 
others, religious outreach. In the missions, Nartana ‰itau is the time of 
bringing in new students  and Church members. It is a time of ha†ha yoga 
and philosophical teaching.
Festivals and
Realms of theFirst Season116 ¶The main festival of Nartana ‰itau, and of the entire 
year, is Guru Pûr∫imâ . The ma†havâsis hold special con-
clave on V aikâsi Vißâkham, the full moon day of May. 
The three Aadheenam realms of the season are: 1) ‰ishi V alley—with its 
secluded Guru Hut and paramparâ shrines on the banks of ‰ishi V alley’s 
Sarava∫abhava Lake; 2) Wailua Farm, with its pastures, orchards and 
gardens; and 3) Kadavul Koyil, with its Guru T emple, entry gardens, Ban-
yan Pavilion, Tiruneri path, sacred tank and its Puakenikeni and Mango 
Ma∫∂apams.

Sacred CalendarThe Second
Season:Jîvana ‰itau117 ¶During Jîvana ‰itau, the rainy season, from mid-
August to mid-December, Living with Íiva: Hinduism’s 
Contemporary Culture is the primary text. The key word 
of this season is work. The colors  are rust, copper-maroon and all shades 
of red—rust for earthy preservation, copper-maroon for fulfillment and 
red for physical energy. The Aadheenam’s 60-foot flag pole flies the rust-
colored dhvaja,  symbolizing environmental care. Copper-maroon and 
all shades of red adorn our smaller flags. This is the season of honoring and showing appreciation for those in the vâ∫aprastha âßrama, life’s elder 
advisor stage. The focus is on preserving what has been created, manifest-
ing goals and fulfilling plans made in the past. Inwardly the emphasis is on direct cognition and caring for the practical details of the external 
world. Practicality is a word much used this season. In the monasteries 
and the missions, there is a big push on studying the sûtras of Living with 
Íiva and these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras . The format of the mission satsa˜ga 
changes into one that in fact helps everyone live and breathe with Lord 
Íiva through personal adjustment to the aphorisms of Living with Íiva,  
which define tradition, culture and protocol. Gurukulams  are established 
or renewed to teach the 64  kalâs  for boys and girls. All work hard to per-
fect and strengthen Íaivite culture  in the life of each member. Kulamâtâs, 
g®ihi∫îs and their daughters  should think ahead and make plans to send 
talented children to dancing, singing and art schools for special courses, 
and ponder ways to make this possible through scholarships and special 
funds. It is a time of building and repairing and caring for what has been 
built, planted or created in any realm of life. It is a physical time, of exer-
cise and exertion in the Bhûloka, a magnetic time for action and willpow-er, of finishing all jobs started since the first ®itau. On the farm, there is 
harvesting of the land’s fruits as we celebrate abundance. In the missions 
during Jîvana ‰itau, the ßishyas can form tirukuttams , and thereby visit 
students’ homes, see how they live and meet their families.
Special 
Sâdhanas of theSecond Season118 ¶The family sâdhana is meditating upon a chapter 
each day of Living with Íiva  and learn  ing and singing 
Natchintanai , the holy songs of our paramparâ, in all lan-
guages, both outwardly and inwardly each day without fail . This is the 
time when vî∫â, tambûrâ  and the drums are most in vogue. In Sansk®it, 
the central chants are perfected . This season of preservation is also a time 
to bring up to date vratas  and sâdhanas  that have been neglected or total-
ly ignored. All seek to preserve the integrity of their commitments to the 
According as one acts, 
so does he become. One becomes virtuous by virtuous action, bad by bad action.
ÍUKLA Y AJUR VEDA,
BRIHADU 4.4.5. UPH, 140Íaiva Dharma Íâstras  are studied; and any needed additions in supple-
mentary manuals, representing new growth, are made. The practical focus 
is completion of unfinished projects. Secular holidays to observe among 
the families include Mother’s Day in May, Father’s Day in June and Grand-
parent’s Day in August. In the monastery the monks begin their annual 31-
day âyurvedic herbal cleansing. Intensive cleaning of monastery buildings 
and grounds takes place. The special dietary adjustments for the season come into effect and new menus are established. New clothing is issued and old garments mended. This season of harvest and new growth is also 
the time to review and reestablish picking and planting routines for the 
gardens. It is a time for ordering seeds and plants for the year, of planting 
trees, fragrant vines and the annual crop. Review is made for scheduling the care of all nine realms of the Aadheenam’s 51 acres. Kadavul temple 
and the Guru T emple are cleaned and renewed during this season, and 
the adjacent grounds receive special, abundant attention. Karma yogîs  are 
invited to help in this and other areas with planting and weeding, digging, 
fertilizing, fence repair and more.

Festivals and
Realms of theThird Season122 ¶The major festival of Moksha ‰itau is Mahâßivarâtri . 
It is at Kauai Aadheenam, as are all other gatherings, not 
a public event but a private one, due to the special sacred-
ness of this sanctuary and its Iraivan moksha koyil. Church members, 
Academy students and special guests by invitation are all who attend. 
This and all other gatherings at the Aadheenam are restricted in size in 
keeping with a covenant  with the county of Kauai in respect to the sur-
rounding residential area. From December 21-25, the Pañcha Ga∫apati fes-
tival is enjoyed in Church family homes worldwide, and the resulting joy 
and peace is felt even by strangers. During this holiday season, in years 
when the need is felt, an open house  is held at Kauai’s Hindu Monastery 
to which friends and neighbors are invited. We do this to express good-
will and appreciation for their kindnesses throughout the year. Satguru 
Jayantî  is always celebrated at Kauai Aadheenam and wherever the guru  
chooses to be on that day. All ßishyas gather to participate. Often, if he is 
outside the US, it will be conducted in his presence as a grand public event. 
The Aadheenam realms of this season are: 1) San Mârga Iraivan T emple, 
a hand-carved, white-granite edifice seated upon a lava-rock plinth, gold-en tower shining in a rainbowed sky; 2) the Path of the Saiva Saints, the 
1,300-foot-long path that winds around ponds, banyan trees, tropical plants 
in seven distinct botanical habitats, with seven
 shrines to the great Íaiva 
saints of South India, and 3) Kauai Aadheenam central, with its offices, pub-
lications facilities, kitchen, library, workshops, monks’ quarters, aviaries and 
cloistered gardens.

Phasely Retreat Days 123 ¶In our monasteries, daily life is scheduled accord-
ing to the traditional Hindu calendar, pañchâ˜ga, which 
is structured around lunar days, called tithis, and certain 
asterisms, called nakshatras, rather than days of the week. In this calendar, 
weeks are roughly equivalent to the phases of the moon. However, while weeks are always seven days, phases sometimes have nine days, sometimes 
eight, usually seven and, occasionally, as few as six. Most phases consist of two retreat days  (which are like the secular weekend), and four, five, six 
or even seven other days, which are like weekdays. Once in a great while 
there are three retreat days in on e phase. Our “weekends” are four per 
After death, the soul 
goes to the next world bearing in mind the subtle impressions of its deeds, and after reaping their harvest returns again to this world of action. Thus, he who has desires continues subject to rebirth.

by invitation, including honored dignitaries of the island, neighbors and 
friends of the Church. Ga∫eßa Chaturthî and Skanda Shash†hî are also 
conducted by ßishyas on the Island. The Aadheenam Realms of this period 
are: 1) San Mârga, the straight path to God, with its rudrâksha, neem,  kon-

Nani Kaua Waterfall and Pond, Bali Hai Falls and Ga˜gâ Sâdhana Ghats.

beginning at the Aadheenam and continuing past the Orchid Pavilion to 
the T eak Tree Turnaround at the edge of Rainbow Amphitheater. 
The Third
Season:Moksha ‰itau120 ¶The third period of the year, Moksha ‰itau, the cool 
season, is from mid-December to mid-April. It is the sea-son of dissolution. The key word is resolution. Merging 
with Íiva : Hinduism’s Contemporary Metaphysics  is the focus of study and 
intense investigation. The colors  of this season are coral-pink, silver and 
all shades of blue and purple—coral for the Self within, silver and blue 
for illumination, and purple for enlightened wisdom. High above flies the 
coral flag, signaling Paraßiva, Absolute Reality, beyond time, form and 
space. Moksha ‰itau is a time of appreciation, of gratitude for all that life 
has given, and a time of honoring elders, those in the sannyâsa stage of 
life. Moksha ‰itau is excellent for philosophical discussions, voicing one’s 
understanding of the path through an enlightened intellect. In finance, it 
is the time for yearly accounting and reconciliation. On a mundane level it is a time of clearing attics, basements, garages, sheds, warehouses, work-
shops and desks, getting rid of unneeded things, of pruning trees, of stream-
lining life on the physical plane—of reengineering.

AM to 1 PM in caring for the build-

the early-morning temple pûjâ. Many perform early-morning  sâdhana  
in their  guha or elsewhere in isolated spots on the property. Opportunity 
may also be taken to sleep later if extra rest is needed.  Maintaining these 
retreat disciplines  keeps the monks physically healthy, emotionally strong 
and mentally alert. It enables them to maintain their mountaintop con-
sciousness, to regenerate their spiritual power from which they constantly 
draw in performance of their duties during the days when service to Íiva 
in His many forms, visitors—special guests, pilgrims, students and mem-
bers—begs attention. V edic tradition explains that when the ma†havâsis

Sâdhu Paksha:
Total RetreatFor 2 Phases125 ¶Twice each year, during a two-week (one fortnight) 
period called sâdhu paksha , “period of striving,” our mon-
asteries are on a total retreat. This is a time of complete 
withdrawal. There are no visitors’ days. There is no access to members. 
There are no special guests or pilgrims. Kulam activities go on as usual, 
phones and faxes and other mode s of communication are in f ull oper ation, 
but the property of the Aadheenam and its dharmaßâlas becomes a closed, 
totally cloistered sanctum sanctorum. Sâdhu paksha falls twice a year 
shortly after the summer and winter solstices, as the sun begins its north-
ern course (uttar âya∫a)  and its southern course (dakshi∫âya∫a) respective-
ly. The dates when the facilities are closed are and should be publicized by the monks for many years ahead for their own physical, emotional and 
mental well-being, to protect their spiritual life, strengthen the uplifting, 
happy darßana of all the monks and regenerate the divine prâ∫as of the 
entire institution. Church members may also observe sâdhu paksha in a 
similar way in their own homes according to their wishes.

meditate in their guhas,  wander the grounds, bathe in the river, perform 
Ga˜gâ sâdhana  by its banks and sit in deep meditation under sacred trees.

the ancient sacred lunar calendar followed for thousands of years by many 
cultures. Its special value is that it always puts the days off, the times of quiet reflection and nonworldly activities, in conjunction with the larger 
forces of the universe that call for retreat, when interactions with others 
will tend to be more inharmonious, when study and discussion will tend 
to be more unproductive and starting new projects may be inauspicious. 
Ash†ami, for example, the eighth lunar day (tithi) of each fortnight, con-
sidered by Íaivites to be a day of conflict and disorder, is always a day 
of retreat. Any new idea or activity initiated or participated in on that day will often require back-tracking and rethinking at a more auspicious 
time because of the conflict that the magnetic forces of the ash†ami moon-
earth relationship provide. We look at it as a day of introspection, peaceful 
in ward ness and simple work in nature, wisely preserved by avoiding intel-
lectual activities. Our days of retreat are ash†ami (eighth  tithi), amavasya 
(new moon), pûr∫imâ (full moon) and the day after each of these. Monks 
are encouraged to make one day of each phasely retreat  a completely rest-
ful day. All through the year, special permission is occasionally given to 
those who are overly tired to sleep late when needed. Also, those monks 
who have “shift sâdhana” schedules, where they perform late-night vigils 
in the temple, ending at midnight or 3
AM, do not attend the 4:30 AM worship 
and meditation gathering. Nonmonastic members—who take their exam-
ple from the way the monasteries are conducted—also implement these flows in fulfilling sûtra 21. One small caveat of following our pañcha˜gam 
rather than a Western calendar is that “days off” or weekends are more dif-ficult to keep track of because of their irregularity. In effect, it keeps our 
monasteries slightly out of phase with the business world, indeed, with 
the world at large. This we find, however,  is an advantage, for it stands as 
a constant reminder to the public that the monastery is a sacred place, so 
sacred that it functions according to a sacred calendar every day of the 
year. We encourage other âßramas and ma†has  to govern their activities 
according to the traditional system of auspicious timing, with the prin-ciple that it is difficult to live a sacred life without following a sacred calendar and closing the doors periodically to all who do not hold the four or five traditional vows of the sâdhaka, yogî and sannyâsin.

according to the traditional system of auspicious timing, with the prin-ciple that it is difficult to live a sacred life without following a sacred calendar and closing the doors periodically to all who do not hold the four or five traditional vows of the sâdhaka, yogî and sannyâsin.

had to make astute clarifications, as you will see in the next chapter, when 
we discovered that so many people coming would make our monaster-

not in line with our goals in bringing more monks into a stable, secluded 
order, which we know is the strength and core of our Church. For years 
we catered to the modern Hindu, newly arrived from India, and to the 
ardha -Hindu who had a Hindu first name but had not yet accepted a last 
name and make the total commitment to his expressed faith. This effort 
ultimately became a psychic burden to me and to my monks, because it 
interrupted the serious mission of the monastery: our personal sâdhana,

forms. But, as their guru, it was necessary for me to curtail the charade. 
This influx of the irreverent also became a burden to my family ßishyas 
living on the island, who were striving to live a more traditional life, as it 
provided a bad example for them and their children. Fortunately, by now 
there were enough âßramas, temples and satsa˜gas to satisfy the spiritual

served this purpose and distanced ourselves from Indian Hindu groups,

Special 
Guests to ourCenters134 ¶Another type of visitors to our monasteries is 
known as special guests  . They are sincere Hindus seeking 
to visit the guru and his temple for the first time. They 
also include individuals whom the talaivar of a monastic kulam knows or 
elects to host for one reason or another. For the most part they are those 
who are collaborating with the monks in a kulam to serve the guru’s mis-
sion in promoting Sanâtana Dharma in the many ways this can be done. 
Examples are journalists for H INDUISM  TODAY , representatives of Hindu 
Heritage Endowment and jyotisha ßâstrîs  who are working closely with 
the ma†havâsi jyotishâchârya. All special guest visits  are arranged and 
scheduled in advance, and the guests are well informed of the mon astery 
flows. Special guests, of course, do not enter when the mon astery is closed: 
after noon, on phasely retreats, sâdhu paksha  and sâdhu mâsa. When the 
talai var has blessings from the guru to admit a special guest for multiple 
visits, an access card is issued for the devotee for the specified period. The 
access card  is displayed on the visitor’s garment near the left shoulder, 
and a slender orange shawl is worn around the neck. These signs prevent embarrassing moments when a monk, member or security person might question why the visitor is on the property. 
Access to
DeliverymenAnd Workers135 ¶Another category with distinct policies includes 
local delivery persons, repairmen and other services. Deliv-
eries may happen anytime during the day without restric-
tion, even when the monastery is closed. In general, we try to schedule the 
presence of repairmen and other workers between 7 AM and noon on days 
when the monastery is open. However, they may also come between 3 PM

what sâdhanas to perform after returning home to solidify personal 
achievements and strengthen the home shrine for the coming year. All 
this and more has to be imparted in a very short time to seekers who visit 
us. Anyone who requests to come on pilgrimage a second time should be 
sponsored by a Church member  or another trusted person (on Kauai or 
in their local community) that is connected with them and makes sure 
that they understand and are willing to fulfill the guidelines of pilgrim-
age throughout their stay. It is the duty of this person or family to gently question them as to their progress on the studies previously given to them, 
so that a fresh, new program can be outlined for their pilgrimage. Their 
response also helps us to know if they are sincere and worthy, with the potential to become Church members. In summary, pilgrims coming other 
than for a brief visit on guest’s day cannot simply arrive unannounced. If 
a problem arises with second-time pilgrims, it is the duty of local council on missions to solve it.

teachings very clear during their stay, for this is the rea-

and if they have obeyed the guru’s instructions given during their previ-

no more than nine days in unbroken continuity, not counting days when

Schedule of
MonasteryVisitors’ Days138 ¶For several years at Kauai’s Hindu monastery, the 
designated visitors’ day was Saturday. However, this proved 
unacceptable, for not uncommonly Saturdays were found 
to fall on our retreat days. Attending to the various needs of visitors bur-
dened the monks on days, when they rightfully should have been free to 
be alone, to go within themselves, to strengthen their attainments, unen-
cumbered by outside forces. It was on May 15, 1995, that we firmly, perma-
nently and irrevocably shifted visitors’ day  to the last day of each phase so 
that our periods of retreat would not be interrupted. We demand that this 
be continued on into the future of futures. Thus, from that day onward we began publishing an ongoing schedule of these visitors’ days.” The sched-
ule also includes the days that the ma†ha is closed and there are no visi-
tors. These are days when the monks interrelate with each other and with their guru, perform chores and catch up on their religious studies. Our 
mon as teries could in modern terms be described as theological seminar-
ies. They are similar to the ancient Himâlayan abodes where mendicants 
come to prepare themselves for their life’s work and mission. 
The Nature
Of OurVisitors’ Day139 ¶On the strictly-observed visitors’ day s, which 
begin at nine o’clock, guests are given a presentation of 
the property and of our noble philosophy. Afterwards, a 
love-offering basket or tray is passed among the guests and books are 
offered for sale and all are given free literature as gifts. Visitor-day guests , 
be they Hindus or non-Hindus, are expected to visit no more than once 
a year. Hindu guests who show a deep interest in the teachings of our 
sampradâya are encouraged to return on serious, prearranged pilgrim-
age to perform deep, daily sâdhana and seek for personal transformation 
through self effort. These special pilgrimages  are also limited to one a 
year, as ex plained previously. Those who want to come more often for 
classes and seminars, should begin serious study as Academy students 
preparing for Church membership. 
Karma Yoga
At theMonasteries140 ¶It is a great blessing to perform humble service, 
karma yoga , at a temple or monastery. All our family 
ßishyas and their progeny  are given this opportunity at 
our centers within the gentle guidelines of our culture. The seva per-
formed is under the guidance of the monastery Siddhidatta Kulam in 
coordination with the local kulapatis . One day a week, every Saturday 
(when the monastery is open), is set aside at our Aadheenam and its dhar-

landscaping or building or involved in other major projects to stay on the 
job all day long in designated areas, except on days when the monastery is 
closed for retreat. Special situations, such as equipment breakdowns, may 
require the presence of repairmen even on retreats or other times when 
the monastery is closed. Most importantly, any personal crisis or emergen-
cy among our Church spiritual family, or the broader community, is attend-ed to without regard to whether it is night or day, phase day or retreat. 
Access to
CasualVisitors136 ¶There are also many casual visitors who hear about 
the facility and seek to visit for a variety of reasons. T o 
accommodate these onlookers, seekers and devotees from 
every walk of life, we have a visitors’ day on the last day of each phase 
from nine to noon. We ask all who seek to visit to call for a schedule of 
our weekly visitors’ days for the next few months. For guru darßana  at 
10:30 AM, guests are invited to call in advance to make appointments.  
Our Truest
Service toVisitors 137 ¶I explain to my monastics that everyone who visits 
Kauai Aadheenam comes to hear our teachings, whether 
they realize it or not. It is up to the hosts to bring the 
guests’ minds into the highest advaitic philosophy, to remind them of 
the goal of life on earth—Self Realization leading to moksha— to make 
their first visit to Kauai one that changes them completely, after which their life improves in wonderful ways. Many think they are coming to 
see the large crystal, others to walk the San Mârga path, others to visit 
the editorial offices of H
INDUISM  TODAY, but we must assume that all are 
coming to be uplifted by the teachings of the Self. Therefore, we do not engage in conversation about their philosophy or other interests. Nor do 
we become involved in their problems or give advice. They should depart 
filled and thrilled with a new perspective on life and a new self-image from hearing about our teachings. All the ma†havâsis should freely pros-
elytize to seekers, speaking boldly of our lofty philosophy on our own 
lands. We want each one who comes to carry away the teachings of the 
untarnished perfection of the soul on its path toward moksha.  T o accom-
plish this, the majority of talking and informing should be on our part, rather than theirs. Senior swâmîs and âchâryas prepare presentations  that 
are memorized by younger monks and Church families who host visitors. 
The monastery Ekadanta Kulam  cares for and oversees all visitors  and 
guests, in coordination with the Church families in the area. All visitors 
are regarded as Gurudeva’s guests , and every effort should be made to

ßishyas and their progeny  are given this opportunity at 
our centers within the gentle guidelines of our culture. The seva per-
formed is under the guidance of the monastery Siddhidatta Kulam in 
coordination with the local kulapatis . One day a week, every Saturday 
(when the monastery is open), is set aside at our Aadheenam and its dhar-

landscaping or building or involved in other major projects to stay on the 
job all day long in designated areas, except on days when the monastery is 
closed for retreat. Special situations, such as equipment breakdowns, may 
require the presence of repairmen even on retreats or other times when 
the monastery is closed. Most importantly, any personal crisis or emergen-
cy among our Church spiritual family, or the broader community, is attend-ed to without regard to whether it is night or day, phase day or retreat. 
Access to
CasualVisitors136 ¶There are also many casual visitors who hear about 
the facility and seek to visit for a variety of reasons. T o 
accommodate these onlookers, seekers and devotees from 
every walk of life, we have a visitors’ day on the last day of each phase 
from nine to noon. We ask all who seek to visit to call for a schedule of 
our weekly visitors’ days for the next few months. For guru darßana  at 
10:30 AM, guests are invited to call in advance to make appointments.  
Our Truest
Service toVisitors 137 ¶I explain to my monastics that everyone who visits 
Kauai Aadheenam comes to hear our teachings, whether 
they realize it or not. It is up to the hosts to bring the 
guests’ minds into the highest advaitic philosophy, to remind them of 
the goal of life on earth—Self Realization leading to moksha— to make 
their first visit to Kauai one that changes them completely, after which their life improves in wonderful ways. Many think they are coming to 
see the large crystal, others to walk the San Mârga path, others to visit 
the editorial offices of H
INDUISM  TODAY, but we must assume that all are 
coming to be uplifted by the teachings of the Self. Therefore, we do not engage in conversation about their philosophy or other interests. Nor do 
we become involved in their problems or give advice. They should depart 
filled and thrilled with a new perspective on life and a new self-image from hearing about our teachings. All the ma†havâsis should freely pros-
elytize to seekers, speaking boldly of our lofty philosophy on our own 
lands. We want each one who comes to carry away the teachings of the 
untarnished perfection of the soul on its path toward moksha.  T o accom-
plish this, the majority of talking and informing should be on our part, rather than theirs. Senior swâmîs and âchâryas prepare presentations  that 
are memorized by younger monks and Church families who host visitors. 
The monastery Ekadanta Kulam  cares for and oversees all visitors  and 
guests, in coordination with the Church families in the area. All visitors 
are regarded as Gurudeva’s guests , and every effort should be made to

A Welcome
To OurSwâmibais143 ¶Our swâmibais —gurus and swâmîs of other orders—
as well as qualified priests , are always welcome at Kauai 
Aadheenam for stays of up to nine days. They enhance the 
education and determination of our young monks and play an important 
part in the Hindu renaissance of H INDUISM  TODAY. Through their meeting 
in sa˜gam with the Íaiva swâmîs, a step forward is always taken for the 
benefit of modern-day Hinduism. Some will qualify to stay at the mon-
astery’s devasthânam facilities, and others may enjoy living at the fam-
ily homes, or even at public facilities, while coming to the monastery as 
special guests. 
Guidelines 
For Resident Guests144 ¶Resident guests are defined as those individuals 
from the three groups named above—1) premonastics, 
2) those on task force  and 3) other special guests such as 
swâmîs   of other orders, Hindu priests and other devout Íaiva men admit-
ted at the discretion of the Guru Mahâsannidhânam—who are permitted to reside in the monastery devasthânam  facility, living the monk’s life dur-
ing their stay. Our Íaivite Íâstras  delineate exacting guidelines for resident 
guests in our monasteries. Brahmacharya is the first rule, as designated in 
our Íaivite Íâstras.  V erses 268-269 state: “Only brahmachârîs should live as 
guests  in the monasteries, and they should be at least one month into the 
brahmacharya  period before entering the mon astery, even as a [resident] 
guest. Family men may come as guests if they are in the process of build-
ing their family. Otherwise they have to live as brahmachârî in order to 
enter the monastery.” Building a family means actively trying to bring a 
soul into physical birth. V erse 270 gives the rationale behind these and 
other rules for monastic residency: “This is how we would prefer the mon-astery to be handled to give us the maximum leverage in always being at 
hand to help and serve, as you in your world are always there to help and 
serve. It is our working together that sustains the consciousness of religion

temple duties, lighting the lamps, picking flowers, lovingly polishing the floors, sweeping, singing the Lord’s praise, ringing the bell and fetching ceremonial water—these constitute the dâsa mârga.

Church family members, men, women and children, in small groups here 
and there in certain areas of the property quietly working in a worshipful 
mood while enjoying the sannidhya , the holy presence, of the monastery. 
Academy students  are as a general rule not permitted to perform karma 
yoga at the monasteries, for when on the Church properties their  sole focus 
is performing sâ dhana and study. There are, however, two exceptions: 
1) Arulßishyas  are eligible to participate in karma yoga when accompanied 
by a kulapati  or, for women, a kulamâtâ; 2) male Academy students may 
be permitted to participate in the Íivaseva Task Force pro gram described 
in the next paragraph. 
Íivaseva
Task ForceProgram141 ¶The Íivaseva Task Force program provides a won-
derful opportunity to perform karma yoga  at Kauai Aad-
heenam or a dharmaßâla and intensify one’s personal sâd-
hana for up to six months . We call this a “task force” program because 
individuals come not only to learn and do sâdhana, but also to help their 
guru in his mission, in the spirit of “work is worship.” Task Force  partici-
pants delight in using their skills and talents in many varied karma yoga  
tasks. Participation is open to male Church ßishyas and to Academy arul-
ßishyas  who have been accepted into a Church family. In addition, from 
time to time special programs may be provided for other male Academy 
students to study, worship and perform sâdhana for nine days or less. All 
those over age twelve are welcome, family men and single men interested 
in performing karma yoga, learning more about the sannyâsin path and 
enjoying a spiritual retreat.  The service performed is under the guidance 
of the mon astery’s Siddhidatta Kulam talaivar and in coordination with 
the local kulapatis . Íivaseva helpers reside in a monastery extension, dev-
asthânam, as resident guests if it is convenient, or outside the monastery 
in family homes or in rental units of their own choosing and pilgrimage 
to the monastery daily to serve. 
Premonastic
Aspirants andSupplicants142 ¶Upakurvâ∫a ßishyas,  aspirant premonastics,   are 
young, male Church members of well-established Church 
families, either their own progeny or foster members of 
their family, serving for six months in preparation for adult life, prior to 
path-choosing, in a monastery or on a mis sionary program  outlined by

Holy Pilg rimsthermore, now and into the future of futures until the end of time we do 
not intend to provide such facilities, which would be to go into the hotel 
business, in the name of karma yoga, which would mean our monastics 
becoming servants of family people and singles. Furthermore, for the last 
several hundred years our traditional gurus have never provided family 
guest facilities. We conclude by stressing that we are not in the temple 
business, the hotel business, the festival business, the cultural entertain-
ment business. We follow our paramparâ which has always spoken out 
spontaneously from the inner sky vidyâ, jñâna, making life-changing 
experiences for all who have come in contact with its satgurus, swâmîs, 
yogîs  and sâdhakas. 
Protecting the
Sanctity:How and Why149 ¶And we say again, as we said in chapter six, what 
makes the San Mârga Iraivan T emple, the moksha spha-
†ika Íivali˜ga, our small and large shrines and publica-
tion facilities so special is that they are part of a monastery or aadheen-
am, the home of a spiritual master, a satguru, and his tirelessly devoted  
sâdhakas, yogîs,  swâmîs and âchâryas. Moreover, the Aadheenam is a 
theological seminary  for training monks from all over the world to take 
holy orders of sannyâsa and join the great team of our Íaiva Siddhânta 
Y oga Order. The cloistered sanctity  of our monastery grounds must never 
be taken for granted. It must be closely maintained by the monks now 
and far into the future more carefully and attentively than they tend the 
gardens. The vibration of unworldliness must be defended by my Íaiva 
yogîs and sâdhakas at all times, day and night.  It must be protected by 
my dîkshâ ßishyas and vrata ßishyas.  It must be respected by my students. 
And thus it will come to be honored with awe by the public at large. None 
should be allowed to violate this sanctity. None shall erode on the fragile sublimity that quietly sustains the culture throughout the land. 
How We
Preserve OurPsychic Bubble150 ¶On the inner planes, each monastery and temple 
has a brilliant aura. The shell of this aura  is seen as a 
great psychic bubble extending around the property and 
far up into the atmosphere as well as deep into the earth. The monks and 
the members who worship on the property are constantly replenishing 
and adding to the aura’s power through consistent daily sâdhana, through 
pûjâ which invokes the cooperation and blessings of the devas and Gods, 
by keeping the monastery scrupulously clean, by prudent management 
and scheduling of all activities, by restricting activities on retreat days, days that the cloister is closed to friends, members and the public, and 
Pûjâ, reading the 
scriptures, singing hymns, performing japa and unsullied 
austerity, truthfulness, restraint of envy, and offering of food—these and other self-purifying acts constitute the flawless satputra mârga.
TIRUMANTIRAM 1496. TMin our world as well as your world.”
Review of
ResidentGuest Stays145 ¶ Each resident guest’s stay  is reviewed by the mon-
astery’s senior minority group at three intervals—after 
nine days, after 39 days and after three months and nine 
days. The individual is invited to sit with the senior minority group and 
is interviewed to determine if he would like to stay on and if his conduct 
during his stay thus far, and his ability to blend his energies with the existing group, has been satisfactory. Resident guests may not return to a 
monastery on Task Force  until at least three months have elapsed since 
their last stay. This pattern of review also applies to upakurvâ∫îs. 
About Our
Resident GuestHousing146 ¶From 1995 onward, resident guest facilities will not 
be provided on central monastery land, but only in deva-
sthâ nams  on land belonging to the Church but not adjoin-
ing monastery properties. This is in keeping with the statement in verse 
512 of our  Íaivite Íâstras,  “If a monastery has a guest house  which is not 
connected to the property of the monastery and outside the force field 
that is supervised, any number of guests can be there without disturb-
ing the balance within the monastery of three to one who has received 
the rehm tyanale  moo kamba , as previously described. Y ou will have to 
study closely these new directions for your order, as they ensure positive 
growth through the years.” Therefore, only monks of our order under four 
vows are allowed on the main monastery property overnight  at Kauai 
Aadheenam and its branch monasteries. There is no exception to this rule, 
not even for short stays of senior swâmîs of other orders or of very special 
priests, even during times of high ceremony. 
About 
Other GuestFacilities147 ¶Because our monasteries are strictly cloistered, we 
do not have live-in guest facilities other than our devasthâ-
nams, which are governed by the strict sâstric re quire-
ments described above . Thus, those pilgrims who do not qualify to stay in 
the devasthânams must seek out other lodging and meals, either in hotels 
or family homes. We foresee that guest facilities  will in future years arise 
around our monasteries to accommodate pilgrims. These may be owned and managed by individual families of our fellowship.

cially our paramparâ is strict in adhering to its ancient

Kauai 
Aadheenam:Not for Tourists151 ¶We firmly affirm that Kauai Aadheenam and its 
Iraivan T emple are not a tourist attraction. Åßramas 
of our kind are destinations for traditional pilgrimage 
where the devotedly serious come by prior arrangement, after having 
prepared themselves at home by fasting and praying. All for whom this 
seems too strict are encouraged to pilgrimage to âßramas that are less tra-
ditional, more liberal and welcoming to one and all, regardless of qualifi-cations or religious persuasion. In 1995 there are many such places.
The Future 
Beckons, thePast Impels152 ¶Thus ends our summary of rules for access to seven 
groups who may enter the monastery properties. These 
are: 1) vrata and dîkshâ ßishyas living up to the sûtras 
they are vowed to uphold, 2) Master Course students coming for serious 
study, 3) sâdhana yâtrikas, special guests on prearranged sacred pilgrim-
age, 4) casual visitors, 5) those on task force, 6) premonastics, including 
upa kurvâ∫a brahmachârîs, and 7) swâmîs,  pa∫∂itas, priests and digni-
taries who come for advice and solace. We emphasize that we give our time to those who appreciate the teachings of Satguru Y ogaswâmî and 
our param parâ: to the Sri Lankan Hindu community  which has turned 
toward us after years of suffering, love and devotion, to ßishya  who are 
students and members, especially those who have received dîkshâ, and 
to our cherished swâmîs, yogîs and sâdhakas, supplicants and aspirants, 
to our kulapatis and kulamâtâs and, most importantly, to the children, 
before they have entered the g®ihastha âßrama. Our future decides the 
way these policies are to be administrated by those who follow.

Kauai 
Aadheenam:Not for Tourists151 ¶We firmly affirm that Kauai Aadheenam and its 
Iraivan T emple are not a tourist attraction. Åßramas 
of our kind are destinations for traditional pilgrimage 
where the devotedly serious come by prior arrangement, after having 
prepared themselves at home by fasting and praying. All for whom this 
seems too strict are encouraged to pilgrimage to âßramas that are less tra-
ditional, more liberal and welcoming to one and all, regardless of qualifi-cations or religious persuasion. In 1995 there are many such places.
The Future 
Beckons, thePast Impels152 ¶Thus ends our summary of rules for access to seven 
groups who may enter the monastery properties. These 
are: 1) vrata and dîkshâ ßishyas living up to the sûtras 
they are vowed to uphold, 2) Master Course students coming for serious 
study, 3) sâdhana yâtrikas, special guests on prearranged sacred pilgrim-
age, 4) casual visitors, 5) those on task force, 6) premonastics, including 
upa kurvâ∫a brahmachârîs, and 7) swâmîs,  pa∫∂itas, priests and digni-
taries who come for advice and solace. We emphasize that we give our time to those who appreciate the teachings of Satguru Y ogaswâmî and 
our param parâ: to the Sri Lankan Hindu community  which has turned 
toward us after years of suffering, love and devotion, to ßishya  who are 
students and members, especially those who have received dîkshâ, and 
to our cherished swâmîs, yogîs and sâdhakas, supplicants and aspirants, 
to our kulapatis and kulamâtâs and, most importantly, to the children, 
before they have entered the g®ihastha âßrama. Our future decides the 
way these policies are to be administrated by those who follow.

154 ¶Himâlayan Academy, which I founded in 1957 , is the educational 
and publishing arm of Íaiva Siddhânta Church. Its mission is to share the 
teachings of Sanâtana Dharma, as a public service to Hindus worldwide, through Innersearch travel-study programs, the Saivite Hindu Religion  
couse and other publications, particularly the quarterly magazine H
INDU-
ISM TODAY and The Master Course trilogy, the Academy’s primary out-front 
set of books, now being translated into many languages. V erse 297 of the 
Íaivite Íâstras offers a simple summary of the Academy’s purpose , “The 
Academy advanced itself through the years in preparing more and more to 
meet the challenges of the changing times in being of service to unfolding 
individual souls deep in the study of the teachings of Master Subramu-
niya. V arious kinds of courses for post-graduate students were offered to 
strengthen their decisions toward the next step: entrance into the Society 
or deeper into their own religion, or into another Íaivite group.”
The Services 
Of HimâlayanAcademy 155 ¶Through personalized home-study lessons, classes, 
lectures and seminars, the Academy  trains and prepares 
devotees for Church membership as well as trains g®i-
hastha teachers  and missionaries. It also assists seekers with severance 
from former faiths and full entrance into any denomination of Hindu-
ism. The Academy is overseen by our monastics. Its primary texts are: The 
Íaivite Hindu Religion course, Dancing with Íiva,  Living with Íiva, Merg-
ing with Íiva, Loving Ga˜eßa, Natchintanai, The Vedic Experience and our 
international quarterly magazine H INDUISM  TODAY. The Academy provides

non-Íaivite by how he responded to the sacred flame, the wearing of the

occurred within him as he absorbed the darßana. It was also easy to see 
if someone was not a Íaivite soul in this life that the Deity withheld this 
darßana, and when he came to worship, his awkwardness in prostration 
and inability to perform the ritual in the true spirit and understanding of it set him apart as an onlooker. Souls came and went from the Íaivite 
temples through the years. The Íaivites stayed as if glued. Others passed 
by as do thoughts.” V erse 295 reiterates, “Thus the Society wielded heavy blows to those who could not qualify, and encouraged them to return to 
their former religion , or on into another Íaivite group more lenient. The 
blows were taken sweetly, of course, as the individuals who received them knew their own frailties and the rightness of the direction given.”

EthicalConversion159 ¶Severance as discussed below applies to three groups: 
1) individuals with prior loyalties to other Hindu sects or 
sampradâyas; 2) individuals with prior loyalties to non-
Hindu religions; 3) individuals with prior loyalties or deep involvement 
in nonreligious streams of thought, such as existentialism, drug culture, 
Marxism or secular humanism. Guidance is offered under the strictest 
ethical principles. This begins by receiving assurance that the candidate 
seeks to sever prior religious affiliations entirely of his or her own free 
will with a full understanding of the previous religion or faith. Severance 
from a previous religion or philosophical affiliation means formally end-
ing one’s membership or affiliation in such a manner so as to no longer 
have special privileges that a total stranger would also not have. Once sev-
erance has been accomplished and other qualifications have been met, the 
Hindu entrance sacrament, nâmakara∫a saμskâra , announces to one and 
all that the deed is done, a promise given, an inner contract made to live up 
to the lofty Sanâtana Dharma to the best of one’s ability. In cases where an 
ardha- Hindu  who seeks to become a member of Íaiva Siddhânta Church 
has already received a nâmakara∫a saμskâra, confirmation is made that 
full severance has been completed as described above. If not, counseling is 
made available to accomplish full conversion.

be they in Eastern bodies or Western bodies, to bring them 
into the fullness of their faith. Such seekers who prove 
their sincerity are assisted with entrance into Íaivism through the tradi-tional name-giving sacrament, called nâmakara∫a saμskâra . Until recently, 
my ma†havâsis were performing this rite for those who sought to enter 
Íaivism. This formally changed in 1995, when qualified priests throughout 
the world took up this sacred duty and began beautifully fulfilling it to 
bring Western seekers into the faith with the love and support of the sur-
rounding community. With this positive pattern firmly established, my 
ma†havâsis no longer perform this saμskâra  for non-Hindus .

ConversionCounseling157 ¶Himâlayan Academy, the gateway to our Church, 
assists seekers with severance from prior religions, faiths, 
lineages or philosophies. Among its purposes is to seek out 
Íaivite souls and avail them their ancient religion in these contemporary 
times. Sûtra 273 explains: “My ardent devotees of other religions or lin-
eages who seek to enter my  Íaiva Church must, with authorized guidance, 
formally  sever all loyalties by talking with former preceptors and gain-
ing a written release. Aum.” This assistance is given primarily to devotees 
seeking to join our fellowship but it is also available to followers of other 
gurus who seek guidance from the Academy, with their guru’s blessings, 
for full conversion to Hinduism. 
Conversion
Screening Is Rigorous158 ¶Not all who seek to convert to Íaivism are accepted. 
Only those who are “Íaivite souls” in this life are encour-
aged to undergo the solemn, consciousness-changing pro-
cess of conversion. Our Íaivite Íâstras  give, in verse 221, important keys to 
distinguish Íaivite souls from those who have yet another path to follow. 
“T o become a Íaivite was fairly easy. It began by reading the scriptures,

distinguish those who simply studied but did not practice inwardly, but 
practiced externally, from those who practiced inwardly. Therefore, the 
small signs were always watched as to how the sacred beads were held, 
how the directions of the guru  were followed, how the Íâstras  were read, 
vibhûti  applied and the general turning of the ebb and flow of their sim-

and goes on in his religion being more of what he is as he gives deeper 
study and more attention to his religion, living its laws, fulfilling its prin-
ciples and attending on the inner planes of consciousness, in the great 
halls of learning, lectures and teachings from Íaivite  saints, blessings of 
Deities and devas  and help in the daily life from the Gods themselves. If 
one is truly not a Íaivite, he receives none of these inner benefits. Being

A Summary
Of EthicalConversion161 ¶T o gain a clear subconscious for his future religious 
life, the individual must examine and reject those beliefs of his previous religion or philosophy which differ from those 
of the sect of Hinduism he wishes to join. Then he must examine and accept the Hindu beliefs which are new to him. If he was confirmed or otherwise initiated in another religion or ideology, he must effect formal 
severance from his previous religion or faith before formally entering the 
Hin du religion through the nâmakara∫a saμskâra, the name-giving sacra-
ment. Full religious conversion means that one’s former religious or phil-
osophical leader is made aware, preferably through a personal meeting 
with the convert, that the individual has entered a new religion. Further, 
ethical conversion means that the parents and relatives, too, understand 
the momentous change that has taken place. This societal recognition, 
along with initiation and taking of vows, legal change of name on pass-
port and all documents, signifies true conversion on all levels of being. Nothing less will suffice.

of the Vedas, to promote the Veda s as the number-one scripture of Hindu-

of their heritage with well-defined metaphysics applicable to modern life,

Membership
In HimâlayanAcademy167 ¶There are two types of membership in the Academy . 
The first is associate membership, made up of all enrolled 
Master Course students, plus nonenrolled students who 
are in contact with us. Second is honorary membership, which includes 
regular readers of H INDUISM  TODAY, registered book owners and friends in 
dharma, most especially my Sri Lankan Tamil devotees whose families 
are connected to our Y ogaswâmî Paramparâ. Enrolled students who seek 
to enter our fellowship  as novitiates prepare themselves through perform-
ing the sâdhanas of The Master Course. They attend mission activities by 
invitation. Gradually each student comes to know the Advaita Èßvaravâda 
philosophy and the traditional Íaiva lifestyle. When ready to make a full

lication. It has been acclaimed a veritable Mahâbhârata for 
modern-day Hinduism. It is a public service of our monas-
tic community to strengthen all Hindu traditions and to uplift and inform 
followers of dharma everywhere. Every Hindu order has its public service, 
be it pâ†haßâlas, hospitals, eye clinics, orphanages, schools or feeding 
centers. H INDUISM  TODAY is the primary form of public service designated 
by me for our ma†havâsis. It was during a world tour through Singapore, 
Malaysia, Mauritius, Reunion, Africa, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Europe and 
other countries that I realized Hinduism had no global voice and no net-
work of communication. The Hindus in Durban had no idea what was 
happening with Hindus in Colombo. Those in London had no connection 
with Hindus in Canada. Thus, I was divinely directed by inner orders from 
our Y ogaswâmî Kailâsa Paramparâ, by my satguru in this life, to fulfill the 
crying need to create an international network that would interconnect all Hindus into one invincible front.

Membership
In HimâlayanAcademy167 ¶There are two types of membership in the Academy . 
The first is associate membership, made up of all enrolled 
Master Course students, plus nonenrolled students who 
are in contact with us. Second is honorary membership, which includes 
regular readers of H INDUISM  TODAY, registered book owners and friends in 
dharma, most especially my Sri Lankan Tamil devotees whose families 
are connected to our Y ogaswâmî Paramparâ. Enrolled students who seek 
to enter our fellowship  as novitiates prepare themselves through perform-
ing the sâdhanas of The Master Course. They attend mission activities by 
invitation. Gradually each student comes to know the Advaita Èßvaravâda 
philosophy and the traditional Íaiva lifestyle. When ready to make a full 
commitment  to this path of dharma, he or she does so with firm mind and

practices as backbiting and gossip. T o this end, the following ahiμsâ  mahâ

Gods, guru , family and fellow devotees. ¶Here is the ahiμsâ mahâ vrata:  
”I believe in Y ou, the one Supreme God, Lord Íiva, and the Gods of our 
Íaivite faith, and in the Íaiva Dharma. In love and trust I recognize Y our

not pose a threat to life, health or safety, not physically or verbally abus-

day to continue the regular practice of interacting with my family, friends and associates according to the wise principles of Positive Discipline.”
Lineage Vow,
ParamparâVrata 171 ¶ “What is the necessity of the spiritual lineage vow  ?” 
one might ask. Traditionally, giving all loyalties to a lin-eage precludes all extraneous training and requires clos-
ing off intellectual inroads to all other lineages, not reading their books, 
not taking their courses. This commitment, voiced in the Paramparâ Vrata, 
is a total focus demanded of the ßishya by the ßishya  himself so that learn-
ing of one unique path may mature past intellectual stages into complete-
ly experiential knowing. Sûtra 236 directs: “Íiva’s devotees, one-pointed in 
striving on their chosen path, do not join or study with any esoteric,  reli-
gious, secular humanist,  atheist,  existentialist or self-improvement  group 
that might undermine their beliefs. Aum.” Here is the Kailâsa Paramparâ 
Vrata: “I believe in Y ou, the one Supreme God, Lord Íiva, and the Gods of

Y our goodness in providing for my every material and spiritual need. I

The Three
FundamentalVows, or Vratas169 ¶Wholeheartedly accepting four vows—Ahimsâ, 
Paramparâ, Íâkâhâra and Daßama Bhâga—is essential to 
any aspiring student. The devonic adepts take these vows 
very seriously, knowing that once a vow is taken at an auspicious moment 
in life, the karmas yet to come change slightly to the positive side so long 
as the vow is upheld. But when vows are neglected, the full force of the held-
back karmas  not previously dissolved , mostly the bad ones, comes as a blow 
to individual, family and friends. So, it is imperative that those who have taken these four  first vows—Ahimsâ, Íâkâhâra, Paramparâ  and Daßama 
Bhâga—receive help when needed from our ma†havâsis in fulfilling them. * 
Ahiμsâ,
The MahâVrata170 ¶Noninjury in thought, word and deed, known in 
Sanskrit as ahiμsâ , is the cardinal virtue and is essential 
to living the Sanâtana Dharma and progressing on the 
path of sâdhana . All those who wish to become members of Saiva Sid-
dhanta Church take the ahiμsâ  mahâ vrata , vowing to strictly uphold the 
three-fold principle of noninjury, physically, mentally and emotionally, as 
fully delineated in Nandinâtha Sûtras 56-65 . This means not killing Íiva’s 
divine creatures, including bugs and rodents, when they do not threaten 
life, health or safety. Additionally, devotees are admonished to not harm living beings in all ways, including not beating them physically, abusing 
them mentally or emotionally, including verbally, should they misbehave 
or disobey, but guiding all through the gentle, thoughtful principles of Pos-
itive Discipline. This extends most importantly to the members of the dev-
otee’s family, including his or her spouse and children. Finally, Bodhinatha emphasizes the importance of not verbally criticizing others behind their 
backs, but maintaining one’s own dignity as well as that of other’s by 
praising them abundantly at every opportunity and avoiding or politely

AcademyUsing it otherwise is forbidden —a karma  reaping loss exceeding all antici-
pated gain. Aum.” Giving Íiva’s money to Íiva first is the spirit of tithing. 
Tithing is regarded not as a bill or a burden, but as a joy. All tithing from 
Academy students goes to the Hindu Heritage Endowment. Here is the tith-
ing vow: “I believe in Y ou, the one Supreme God, Lord Íiva, and the Gods 
of our Íaivite faith, and in the Íaiv a Dharma. In love and trust I recog-
nize Y our goodness in providing for my every material and spiritual need. 
I accept the principle of daßamâμßa (giving one tenth of my gross income) 
as the method by which I may acknowledge my gratitude to you, Lord Íiva, and share in helping Y ou fulfill and perpetuate Y our work on earth. As an act of dedication, I am resolved this day to begin (continue) the regular 
practice of tithing.”
The Value
Of the Three Vows175 ¶Upholding these four vows, chaturvrata,  builds disci-
pline and character. The nonviolence vow builds character 
through the control of the tendency to harm others, which 
is the control of the instinctive mind. The vegetarian vow builds character 
through the control of appetite, which is also the control of the instinctive 
mind. The lineage vow builds character through control of mental and 
philosophical ramification, which is control of the intellect. The tithing 
vow builds character through the control of money, which is the control of 
desire. All of this mastery of the forces of mind, body and emotion gives 
strength to face the future and perhaps, though there are no guarantees, to 
attain moksha in this life. 
The Evolution
Of theMaster Course176 ¶The Master Course , Prâbhu Sanmârga,  first began in 
1957 when the doors of the Academy opened in San Fran-
cisco. It has always been a home-study course of applied 
yogic tantras,  and the communication with students has been mostly 
through correspondence, except for the many travel-study programs the 
Academy has held in various countries through the years. The Master 
Course  necessarily has taken many forms in the last four decades in serv-
ing community needs as they arose. It has given birth to all of our books, 
pamphlets and posters as the wealth of Íaivism and mainstream Hindu-
ism unfolded in all its glory and complexity in the West. Past editions of 
The Master Course are available on the World Wide Web. 
The Nature
Of the MasterCourse Today 177 ¶Now The Master Course, published in several lan-
guages, serves the needs of Hindus in many countries. It 
provides a philosophical study and practical application 
of Íaivite culture and mysticism through systematic sâdhana . Sûtra 176 
Now, there are, of a 
truth, three worlds: the world of men, the world of the fathers, and the world of the Gods. The world of the Gods is verily the best of worlds.

BRIHADU 1.5.16. UPH, 89Y ogaswâmî and Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.” 
Vegetarian 
Vow , Íakâhâra 
Vrata 172 ¶The second vow, Íâkâhâra Vrata  , is likewise funda-
mental, as Saivam in Tamil means vegetarianism, and all 
higher consciousness depends on a pure and healthy body, 
as outlined in sûtra 116, “All my followers shall eat a strictly vegetarian 
diet. They understand that higher consciousness depends on the chemis-
try of foods consumed and thus forbid themselves to eat meat, fish, shell-
fish, fowl or eggs. Aum.” This vrata embraces the science of âyurveda, as 
ex plained in sûtra 186, “Íiva’s devotees cook and eat in the balanced,  var-
ied, vegetarian, Indian  âyurvedic manner, enjoying healthy, unprocessed, 
freshly cooked foods. Occasionally, they may partake of cuisine from other 
world cultures. Aum.” The vegetarian vow also means eating a healthy, 
balanced diet, thus avoiding chemically adulterated foods and minimiz-
ing junk foods and frozen foods, as indicated in sûtras 187-190. 
Vegetarianism’s
Many Virtures173 ¶Most importantly, ahiμsâ,  the great imperative of 
Hindu dharma, demands that ßishyas adhere to vegetari-
anism, as stated in sûtra 56: “Íiva’s devotees do not inten-
tionally kill or harm any person or  creature.  Nonviolence, physically, men-
tally and emotionally, is their highest code. Full of  compassion, they are 
never a source of  fear or hurtfulness. Aum.” This cardinal ideal is likewise 
embodied in the virtues of mitâhâra  and saucha, moderate ap petite and 
purity, as reflected in sûtra 50: “  All devotees of Íiva observe mitahâra,  mod-
eration  in appetite, not eating too much or consuming  meat,  fish,  shellfish, 
 fowl or  eggs.  They uphold ßaucha,  avoiding  im purity in body, mind and 
speech. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.” Here is the vegetarian vow: “I believe in Y ou, 
the one Supreme God, Lord Íiva, and the Gods of our Íaivite faith, and 
in the Íaiva Dharma. In love and trust I recognize Y our goodness in pro-
viding for my every material and spiritual need. I accept the principle of 
ßâkâhâra as the method by which I may acknowledge my compassion, my 
karu∫â, for all living beings. As an act of dedication, I am resolved this 
day to begin (continue) the regular practice of eating a strict vegetarian diet and not eating meat, fish, shellfish, fowl or eggs.”
Tithing Vow ,
DaßamaBhâga Vrata 174 ¶The third vow, Daßama Bhâga Vrata  , brings the stu-
dent into the arena of responsible money management in 
which one-tenth of all funds received is recognized as a 
sacred trust to be given freely before the other nine-tenths is used. Sûtra 
161 summarizes: “Íiva’s close devotees take a  vow and joyously  tithe ten 
percent of their gross  income to their lineage monthly. This is God’s money.

of Íaivite culture and mysticism through systematic sâdhana . Sûtra 176 
Now, there are, of a 
truth, three worlds: the world of men, the world of the fathers, and the world of the Gods. The world of the Gods is verily the best of worlds.

Vegetarian 
Vow , Íakâhâra 
Vrata 172 ¶The second vow, Íâkâhâra Vrata  , is likewise funda-
mental, as Saivam in Tamil means vegetarianism, and all 
higher consciousness depends on a pure and healthy body, 
as outlined in sûtra 116, “All my followers shall eat a strictly vegetarian 
diet. They understand that higher consciousness depends on the chemis-
try of foods consumed and thus forbid themselves to eat meat, fish, shell-
fish, fowl or eggs. Aum.” This vrata embraces the science of âyurveda, as 
ex plained in sûtra 186, “Íiva’s devotees cook and eat in the balanced,  var-
ied, vegetarian, Indian  âyurvedic manner, enjoying healthy, unprocessed, 
freshly cooked foods. Occasionally, they may partake of cuisine from other 
world cultures. Aum.” The vegetarian vow also means eating a healthy, 
balanced diet, thus avoiding chemically adulterated foods and minimiz-
ing junk foods and frozen foods, as indicated in sûtras 187-190. 
Vegetarianism’s
Many Virtures173 ¶Most importantly, ahiμsâ,  the great imperative of 
Hindu dharma, demands that ßishyas adhere to vegetari-
anism, as stated in sûtra 56: “Íiva’s devotees do not inten-
tionally kill or harm any person or  creature.  Nonviolence, physically, men-
tally and emotionally, is their highest code. Full of  compassion, they are 
never a source of  fear or hurtfulness. Aum.” This cardinal ideal is likewise 
embodied in the virtues of mitâhâra  and saucha, moderate ap petite and 
purity, as reflected in sûtra 50: “  All devotees of Íiva observe mitahâra,  mod-
eration  in appetite, not eating too much or consuming  meat,  fish,  shellfish, 
 fowl or  eggs.  They uphold ßaucha,  avoiding  im purity in body, mind and 
speech. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.” Here is the vegetarian vow: “I believe in Y ou, 
the one Supreme God, Lord Íiva, and the Gods of our Íaivite faith, and 
in the Íaiva Dharma. In love and trust I recognize Y our goodness in pro-
viding for my every material and spiritual need. I accept the principle of 
ßâkâhâra as the method by which I may acknowledge my compassion, my 
karu∫â, for all living beings. As an act of dedication, I am resolved this 
day to begin (continue) the regular practice of eating a strict vegetarian diet and not eating meat, fish, shellfish, fowl or eggs.”
Tithing Vow ,
DaßamaBhâga Vrata 174 ¶The third vow, Daßama Bhâga Vrata  , brings the stu-
dent into the arena of responsible money management in 
which one-tenth of all funds received is recognized as a 
sacred trust to be given freely before the other nine-tenths is used. Sûtra 
161 summarizes: “Íiva’s close devotees take a  vow and joyously  tithe ten 
percent of their gross  income to their lineage monthly. This is God’s money.

light their inner path. In these profound lessons they discover the meaning 
of  life’s many lessons. Aum.” In the study of this mysterious Nâtha course, 
each student is guided by my special instructions for personal sâdhana, 
along with challenges and assignments for additional study or service. 
Fulfilling these challenges enhances the student’s abilities to go within, 
as an inner connection with the paramparâ is slowly formed as he or she 
moves along the path of charyâ, kriyâ, yoga and jñâna. 
How Seekers 
Get Started inTheir Study178 ¶All who express an interest in our teachings are 
encouraged to obtain the books of the Master Course tril-ogy, and subscribe to H
INDUISM  TODAY. Children are encour-
aged to study the Saivite Hindu Religion course, which is compiled in 
many books. Most books of this course are available in English and several 
other languages , such as Malay, Hindi, French and Tamil. Those who speak 
two or more languages are encouraged to study it  in each of those tongues 
for a complete understanding. Thousands of children in many nations 
study in their local school Level One (books 1-7) Íaivite Hindu Religion.

Pilgrimages toHoly Lands 179 ¶The sacred pilgrimages  we make to India and other 
countries from time to time are called Innersearch travel-
study  programs. During pilgrimage to Íaivism’s holy sanc-
tuaries, members and students receive personal help and encouragement 
on the path and enjoy the adventure of experiencing new lands, peoples, 
languages, cultures and ways of worship. It is a rare time in their lives, 
apart from all distractions and responsibilities, to be with me and go in and in and in and discover! It is a time to look forward to, plan for and ardently prepare for all year long. These travel-study pilgrimages, with 
their wonderful flourish and inner intensity, have always left never-to-be-
forgotten impressions and established life-long friendships.

are strengthened by the penance of making up for all days on which sâd-
hana was neglected. This is compassionately supervised by the elders 
of our community. Ours is not an ordinary Íaiva organization. It is an extraordinary Íaiva organization. Each one is on the path to mukti in this

goodness, fulfilling every vow and sâdhana they undertake. It, therefore, 
is the duty of the family heads, the kulapatis, to see to it that the three 
vratas and the two inititations are upheld and that necessary correction 
be made when they are not.

The Academy has two memberships: associate and honorary. In the Church 
we have three memberships: novitiate (vrataßishya),  initiate (dîkshâßishya) 
and monastic (ma†havâsi ßishya).  
1.  HONORARY ACADEMY MEMBERS
Honorary Academy members include regular readers of H INDUISM  TODAY, 
registered book readers and our many friends in dharma , supporters who 
give of their time, talents and finances for Academy and Church activities, 
temples and publications. Many, regarding me as their guru, seek counsel. 
2.  ASSOCIATE ACADEMY MEMBERS 
Associate Academy members are devotees who are formally enrolled in 
the study of The Master Course .
3.  NOVITIATE CHURCH MEMBERS, VRATAÍISHY AS
Novitiate Church members, vrataßishyas, are those who have completed 
the requirements in the Íishya’s Vows and Initiations  booklet, including 
any necessary reconciliation of religious loyalties, having been whole-
heartedly accepted into a kulapati family. They take two additional vows: 
the Íaiva Íraddhâdhâra∫â Vrata (the pledge to uphold and preach the 
Íaivite Creed) and the Nandinâtha Sûtra Vrata  
4.  INITIATE CHURCH MEMBERS, DˆKSHÅÍISHY AS 
Initiate Church members, dîkshâßishyas, are devotees who have received 
mantra dîkshâ  or vishesha dîkshâ . T o receive mantra dîkshâ,  devotees 
demonstrate a consistently orthodox life style. Vishesha dîkshâ ßishyas, 
affectionately known as chelas, are members who have demonstrated 
consistency in upholding all 365 sûtras,  are exemplary members of their extended family and have received vishesha dîksha —initiation and obli-
gation to perform daily Íiva pûja. 
5.   MONASTICS AND PREMONASTICS, MAÊHAV ÅSI ÍISHY AS
All monastics and premonastics under vows are known as ma†havâsi 
ßishyas. Their protocol and procedures are explained in the Ma†havâsi 
Íâstras and summarized in sûtras 316 to 365 of Living with Íiva.

explained their view of evaluating potential members in 
verse 371: “We know who served with us in the ’in-betw een,‘ 
and the birth that they took, as well as whether they are candidates for 
the Society . We then must be consulted as to whether they are impostors 
or well fit. Ask us in the perpendicular Tyaf script, ’Are they impostors or 
well fit to enter the “Society?‘ We do not need many; but if many, it must 
be few, and increased from within itself by large families, supported by 
endowments from the Church if they dedicate to raise their sons for our 
seminary.” V erse 371 continues, “When impostors are inadvertently admit-

which was and is today renewable each year. Oddly enough, you must 
believe that they will not be surprised, for they know who they are. Pre-

their more unenlightened subjects did not. Royalty knows royalty. The 
peasant knows the peasant. Each in his own lot reigns supreme and is 
only bothersome when he assumes the other’s place. Therefore, those who are bothersome to the Society are not of the Society, not working for the 
good of the whole, but working, obviously, for increased benefits to them-
selves. This will be obvious, and we’ll make it so.”

Annual 
ReligiousDedication193 ¶Each novitiate and initiate member keeps his mem-
bership active by fulfilling the varshâtma nivedana sâdha-
na at Guru Pûr∫imâ during the month of July. Varshâtma 
nivedana,  “yearly self-dedication,” is the traditional practice of coming for-
ward to one’s guru with love, gifts and thankfulness, vowing full commit-
ment for the coming year. “For each step the ßishya takes, the guru takes 
nine.” Coming  forward at this auspicious time gives the guru per mission to 
inwardly guide the ßishya for yet another year. All such renewals of dedica-
tion are presented before the tiruvadi at the pâdapûjâ. As stated in sûtra  246, 
“Íiva’s devotees seek their satguru’s blessings, act in harmony with his will, 
trust in his supreme wisdom, seek refuge in his  grace and rush forward 
to  re dedicate themselves each year during the month of the  guru.  Aum. ”
Cancellation
Of ChurchMembership194 ¶Those who do not perform this yearly sâdhana— the 
sincere gesture of taking one step forward, allowing their 
guru  to take  his nine steps toward them—thereby excuse 
themselves silently and are no longer considered members or students. 
Íishyas may also disqualify themselves by consistent failure to follow the 
central Nandinâtha Sûtras, such as those regarding vegetarianism, tithing, 
loyalty to the lineage, not smoking and wives not working.  Our Íaivite 
Íâstras  explain: ”If a family did not live according to the Íâstras , which 
were not extremely strict, but wise, it was simply considered that they had 
entered another world and were no longer invited into a Íaivite  home, tem-
ple or monastery. However, no ill feelings toward them existed, and when 
they began adjusting their life pattern and obeying the Íaivite  law, invita-
tions were then extended. This was generally decided by a senior minority 
of each family group surrounding a temple in cooperation with a swâmî  
and generally felt on an inner vibration by all as to the rightness or wrong-
ness of the situation, for no Íaivite  ever hurt anyone, they just avoided.” 
Detachment
From FormerMembers195 ¶My ßishyas are enjoined to discontinue their asso-
ciation with former members, especially those who are 
hostile or disgruntled, as explained in sûtras 276 and 277:

or attack their  lineage. By not interacting with detractors, they forestall 
 conflict and thus protect their lineage as well as themselves. Aum. My dev-

Being Part
Of a KulapatiFamily190 ¶All family devotees who are Church members,  
arulßishyas and children of members are a part of one 
of our fellowship’s  many extended families , called b®ihat 
ku †um ba, under the guidance of the preceptor and that of the family patri-
arch, kulapati, and his wife, kulamâtâ. Joining with others as cherished kin-
dred within an extended family enhances the spiritual unfoldment of one and all. Character building for the individual is one of the many benefits. 
Access Cards,
AbhayaPâtra191 ¶Each Church member receives an access card, abha-
ya pâtra, with the validity period prominently displayed, 
for ongoing participation in activities on any of our proper-
ties. Our Íaivite Íâstras foretold of the access card  in verse 339: “The card 
became a symbol of Íaivism in the West. Renewable once a year, it admit-
ted the Íaivite into the College, onto the Path of the Nayanars and through the temple doors.” Church members are issued one-year access cards at the 
beginning of the third season, in mid-December. In our monastic commu-
nity, postulants receive two-year admittance with their renewal of vows 
in January; aspirants and supplicants receive six-month admittance with 
their vow renewal each January and July. Other seekers and pilgrims are 
received as guests and may be given temporary cards for shorter periods 
of time.  Each month during Ardhra Abhisheka at Kauai Aadheenam, the 
name of each Church member is chanted before the Deity. 
Qualifying
New Novitiates192 ¶Sponsorship of a novitiate member is the duty of the 
devotee’s kulapati ku†umba,  patriarch family. After satisfy-
ing themselves that the ßishya has met the requirements , 
the kulapati and kulamâtâ sign their names on the Vows and Initiations  
booklet as joint sponsors. They submit this document to Kauai Aadheen-
am for final signing by the Guru Mahâsannidhânam and the âcharya s.  
Current members are enjoined to bring new members into the fellowship 
and to assist in their adjustment as indicated in sûtra 269: “All within 
my Íaiva Church who sponsor new members are responsible for their 
strengths and failures during the probationary year, their study for initia-
tion and their merger with others as milk poured into milk. Aum.” Those

Church accept newcomers as part of their own family. They care for, teach, 
gent ly guide and prepare these souls for their first  in itiation. Y ea, they too 
were once new members. Aum ( sûtra 268).” 
Annual 
ReligiousDedication193 ¶Each novitiate and initiate member keeps his mem-
bership active by fulfilling the varshâtma nivedana sâdha-
na at Guru Pûr∫imâ during the month of July. Varshâtma 
nivedana,  “yearly self-dedication,” is the traditional practice of coming for-
ward to one’s guru with love, gifts and thankfulness, vowing full commit-
ment for the coming year. “For each step the ßishya takes, the guru takes 
nine.” Coming  forward at this auspicious time gives the guru per mission to 
inwardly guide the ßishya for yet another year. All such renewals of dedica-
tion are presented before the tiruvadi at the pâdapûjâ. As stated in sûtra  246, 
“Íiva’s devotees seek their satguru’s blessings, act in harmony with his will, 
trust in his supreme wisdom, seek refuge in his  grace and rush forward 
to  re dedicate themselves each year during the month of the  guru.  Aum. ”
Cancellation
Of ChurchMembership194 ¶Those who do not perform this yearly sâdhana— the 
sincere gesture of taking one step forward, allowing their 
guru  to take  his nine steps toward them—thereby excuse 
themselves silently and are no longer considered members or students. 
Íishyas may also disqualify themselves by consistent failure to follow the 
central Nandinâtha Sûtras, such as those regarding vegetarianism, tithing, 
loyalty to the lineage, not smoking and wives not working.  Our Íaivite 
Íâstras  explain: ”If a family did not live according to the Íâstras , which

3. At any time after age 17 , the youth  may qualify for adult Church member-
ship as a vrataßishya. T o do so, he or she must complete the three levels of 
The Master Course Correspondence Study and qualify as an arulßishya. 
4. Once a youth has been accepted as a vrataßishya,  a welcoming cer-
emony is held by the families. At this time, the youth’s astrological karmic 
pattern is reviewed at the Aadheenam and by the kulapati families, and a 
plan is developed for the coming years, including further education .
5. All youth must qualify as vrataßishyas  by age 20. As explained in sûtra 
150: “My devotees require children to decide before age twen ty whether 
to enter  Saiva Siddhanta Church of their own volition or to choose anoth-
er path. If they go away, they are always welcome back. Aum Nama˙ 
Íivâya.”
The Discipline 
Of Tithing,Daßamâμßa198 ¶All members of the Church and all arulßishya stu-
dents of the Academy take the Daßama Bhâga Vrata  (one-
tenth vow) and perform the discipline of tithing, giving 
ten percent of their income each month without fail and reconciling their tithing  once a year. All tithing  is sent to Kauai Aadheenam. This is regard-
ed as God’s money, and in a deeper sense, all of one’s income is God’s. Nine-
ty percent is dedicated to the family and is governed by a strict household 
budget. There is a great power in daßamâμßa, paying religious dues . As 
stated in sûtra 163, “Íiva’s close devotees delight in the unfailing law that 
by tithing freely and wholeheartedly, with a consciousness of plenty, they become receptive to  God’s  blessings and draw to them abundance and 
happy experiences. Aum.” Living in the consciousness of giving, tithers 
naturally attract more abundance. In giving, they actually receive. T o con-
tinually fulfill the discipline of tithing once the vow is taken requires self-
control and wise money management through following a monthly budget, curbing desires and controlling emotions. This builds inner strength and character. Novitiates and initiates tithe to Íaiva Siddhânta Church. The 
tithing of Academy students goes to Hindu Heritage Endowment. 
As the sun, the eye of 
the whole world, is not sullied by the external faults of the eyes, so the one inner soul of all things is not sullied by the sorrow in the world, being external to it.

and ostracizing. Thus a firm, protective wall of  silence is built between 
our lineage and its detractors, whether individuals or groups. Aum.” Since 
it is important for every seeker to have the guidance of a preceptor, those 
who have made a firm decision to leave the guru  are encouraged to seek 
out a guru or a swâmî who is more lenient. I advise this so that they can, 
under his gentle guidance and encouragement, continue to progress and 
fulfill their prârabdha karmas . They are also enjoined to make new asso-
ciations among the new guru’s followers and to discontinue associating 
with our fellowship. One who leaves a guru must also make a clean break 
from his followers. 
Reconciliation;
WelcomingBack 196 ¶Those who discontinue as members and students 
and later return may seek to requalify themselves through 
personally reconciling with the preceptor and undertak-
ing his assigned Master Course study and sâdhanas through Himâlayan 
Academy. As they begin their fresh new start they do so without their for-
mer seniority, which they surrendered when they left the Church. They 
are welcomed back into the Academy as new students just beginning. If 
they pursue their studies, they may qualify as vrataßishyas again, having 
retaken the six vratas. Once a devotee is accepted back into the congrega-
tion by the guru , it is up to all ßishya to extend full welcome as stressed 
in sûtras 278 and 279: “My devotees who refuse to shun those who should 
be shunned should themselves be shunned. But none shall shun those who have  reconciled with the preceptor and been publicly welcomed back into 
association. Aum. My devotees extend every effort to welcome and bring 
back into the lineage those seeking to  reenter its fold, having formerly left, 
provided they show grief, remorse and repentance, and reconcile with the 
 satguru . Aum.”
About Children 
Of ChurchFamilies 197 ¶ 1. Children whose mother or father or both are 
members automatically have access to Church activities 
by virtue of their family’s commitment. While growing up  
they are taught Íaivism through the study of Íaivite Hindu Religion, books 
one through six, in school and-or under the guidance of their parents. 
2. Between the 13th and 15th birthdays, children should begin the Master 
Course Correspondence Study. By doing so the child becomes an enrolled 
Íaivite student . He or she may continue participating in fellowship activi-
ties as a student until age 20.  The Íaivite Íâstras, in verse 331, offer addi-

About
SamayaDîkshâ202 ¶Samaya dîkshâ , also called  mantra dîkshâ , is the 
fundamental Íaiva initiation, for through it the devotee is formally connected to a particular lineage by virtue of the 
preceptor’s spiritual power and authority. The sûtras of Living with Íiva 
carefully prepare the novitiate for samaya dîkshâ.  All initiates instruct 
newcomers  not just intellectually but more by example. Novitiates  are 
instructed in how to transform themselves by themselves through daily 
pûjâ, temple worship, attending festivals, tithing, vegetarianism, pilgrim-
age, scriptural reading, Ga˜gâ sâdhana and more. Samaya dîkshâ is the 
blessing and empowering to enter the kriyâ pâda and perform certain 
daily sâdhanas, including chanting the Pañchâkshara Mantra, Aum Nama˙ 
Íivâya, each day at least 108 times on a mâlâ of rudrâksha japa beads. 
The Meaning
Of Nama˙Íivâya 203 ¶This mantra quiets the mind, harmonizes the nerve 
system, bringing forth knowledge from within, reminding 
the ßishya of his purpose in life and relationship with Lord 
Íiva. Nama˙ Íivâya literally means “adoration to God Íiva.” The symbol-
ism of each of the five letters is: Si is Íiva; Va is His revealing grace, Ya is 
the soul, Na is His concealing grace and Ma is the world. Nama˙ Íivâya is 
the gateway to yoga. The secret of Nama˙ Íivâya is to hear it from the right 
lips at the right time. Then, and only then, is it the most powerful man-

AlienInfluences 199 ¶It is traditional that, after a ßishya gives his loyalties 
to a sampradâya and/or a paramparâ, he is restricted from 
studying with or seeking personal guidance from other 
gurus, swâmîs, astrologers or other kinds of religious or philosophical teach-
ers without the preceptor’s permission. In our fellowship, this covenant is established at the student arulßishya level when the devotee takes the Param-
parâ Vrata. Membership in Íaiva Siddhânta Church means discipleship, fol-
lowing the sampradâya’s teachings faithfully, patiently and one-pointedly in 
the tradition of Íaivism. This injunction also means not inviting teachers or 
lecturers to speak at gatherings of members unless approved by the Kailâsa 
Pî†ham. Guidelines for avoiding alien influences are given in sûtras 236–240 
of Living with Íiva, as well as sûtras 233–234 . My âchâryas, swâmîs, yogîs 
and sâdhakas  perform the service of guiding membership activities from day 
to day. Members are encouraged to communicate with them as needs arise. 
About the 
FollowingChapter200 ¶ Initiation, explained in the next chapter, is the goal 
of all Hindus, and an absolute must for all Íaiva souls. This 
is why they seek out a guru. This is why they manifest in 
their lives all the good that he would approve. This is why they strive and 
strive and strive to fulfill, even better than he would expect, all of his 
expectations. Dîkshâ from a satguru is nothing that can be erased, noth-
ing that can be altered, nothing that can be described, as we have tried to 
describe in the pages ahead. This is why initiation is given—at an auspi-cious time, in a spiritual mood, at the right moment in the karma of the 
soul’s long journey from conception in Íiva’s all-pervasive ßakti to manifes-
tation in the current incarnation. Dîkshâ is a pathway to moksha in this life 
or a future life. There is no alternative way. There is none. There is none.Page 106

AlienInfluences 199 ¶It is traditional that, after a ßishya gives his loyalties 
to a sampradâya and/or a paramparâ, he is restricted from 
studying with or seeking personal guidance from other 
gurus, swâmîs, astrologers or other kinds of religious or philosophical teach-
ers without the preceptor’s permission. In our fellowship, this covenant is established at the student arulßishya level when the devotee takes the Param-
parâ Vrata. Membership in Íaiva Siddhânta Church means discipleship, fol-
lowing the sampradâya’s teachings faithfully, patiently and one-pointedly in 
the tradition of Íaivism. This injunction also means not inviting teachers or 
lecturers to speak at gatherings of members unless approved by the Kailâsa 
Pî†ham. Guidelines for avoiding alien influences are given in sûtras 236–240 
of Living with Íiva, as well as sûtras 233–234 . My âchâryas, swâmîs, yogîs 
and sâdhakas  perform the service of guiding membership activities from day 
to day. Members are encouraged to communicate with them as needs arise. 
About the 
FollowingChapter200 ¶ Initiation, explained in the next chapter, is the goal 
of all Hindus, and an absolute must for all Íaiva souls. This 
is why they seek out a guru. This is why they manifest in 
their lives all the good that he would approve. This is why they strive and 
strive and strive to fulfill, even better than he would expect, all of his 
expectations. Dîkshâ from a satguru is nothing that can be erased, noth-
ing that can be altered, nothing that can be described, as we have tried to 
describe in the pages ahead. This is why initiation is given—at an auspi-cious time, in a spiritual mood, at the right moment in the karma of the 
soul’s long journey from conception in Íiva’s all-pervasive ßakti to manifes-
tation in the current incarnation. Dîkshâ is a pathway to moksha in this life 
or a future life. There is no alternative way. There is none. There is none.Page 108

About 
Nirvâ∫aDîkshâ206 ¶Nirvâ∫a dîkshâ  marks the beginning of tapas 
and the serious practice of yoga for monastics. This dîk-
shâ intensifies the activity of the ku∫∂alinî, and changes 
are expected as the external ego melts and the mellowness of the soul is exposed. One who receives this dîkshâ is a practitioner of yoga, preparing 
for sannyâsa dîkshâ. Nirvâ∫a dîkshâ is given to monastics when they don 
the yellow robes of the yogî tapasvin . It is also given to sâdhakas who have 
served faithfully for twelve years or more and qualify to serve as catalysts 
of Himâlayan Academy. They are then known as nirvâ∫a sâdhaka  and 
wear a single strand of rudrâksha beads. 
About
Sannyâsa Dîkshâ207 ¶Sannyâsa dîkshâ  marks the complete abdication of 
the world and of personal life. It is the death of the ego 
for the Hindu ma†havâsi and his irrevocable entrance 
onto the path of the renunciate monastic. In our order this dîkshâ is 
given after a minimum of twelve brahmacharya years according to the 
ßâstric calculations. 
About 
ÅchâryaDîkshâ208 ¶Åchârya dîkshâ  is given to swâmîs who have proved 
their dedication and spiritual maturity and earned twen-ty-four years of brahmacharya age, as explained in the 
Íaivite Íâstras.  Ordination as a Íaiva âchârya  brings the sannyâsin into 
more responsibilities for training and counseling young monastics. Íaiva 
âchâryas are the senior teachers of our theology.

makes us sad to think of life being different than it is now, with all of us 
working together so closely and with such great love. Please rest assured, 
as you read this section, that I plan to live a long time. My longevity  is

affectionately known as chelas . After this initiation, the devotee is obligat-

new power. This worship is performed during the early morning, followed 
by scriptural study and 108 repetitions of the Pañchâkshara Mantra. The 
pûjâ obligation of vishesha dîkshâ is not fulfilled by attending the pûjâ 
performed by the head of the house in the shrine room. Each member who 
has received this initiation performs the pûjâ privately (the long, medium

heretofore not accessible. As part of the dîkshâ, the ßishya voices and signs 
the following solemn vow binding himself and his family line to the Írî

Acceptance
Of NewSuccessors  212 ¶Now I speak to my devotees who come forward to

as will his successor and the successor that follows him. After my mahâ-

Írî Râmak®ish∫a is the center of his institutions. I will always be satguru

the carrying forward and dissemination of the Kailâsa Paramparâ teach-

rather than future gurus neglecting these treasures or replacing them

has been dear to our congregation for 20 to 30 years. All know them to be extremely competent, holy men of the highest calibre. At the time 
of my grand departure, the senior most among the circle of my present 
three âchâryas still living, those being Åchârya V eylanswâmî, Åchârya 
Palani swâmî and Åchârya Ceyonswâmî, will automatically become the 
guru mahâsannidhânam, to sit upon the Kailâsa Pî†ham, in full charge 
of Kauai Aadheenam, its branches and memberships, and thus carry for-
ward the spiritual lineage of our paramparâ, fully empowered to give the 
dîkshâs of our lineage— samaya, vishesha, sannyâsa  and abhisheka. The 
announcement is now, and the appointment will take place automatical-
ly upon my mahâsamâdhi, with the coronation of the rudrâksha mâlâ 
upon his head happening shortly after I experience transition. It is my 
edict that each of the above three âchâryas, who are the stewards of Íaiva 
Siddhânta Church, Himâlayan Academy and Hindu Heritage Endowment, 
will take his place upon the Pî†ham upon the grand departure of the other. 
This means that the next successor after Åchârya V eylanswâmî would be 
Åchârya Palaniswâmî, followed by Åchârya Ceyonswâmî, in that order. 
Thereafter, seniority will not be a factor in the appointment of successors. This, therefore, is my succession plan as of 1995. This plan is solely my 
decision, and I reserve the right to modify or totally change it at anytime. 
Like these Íâstras, the  succession decree remains malleable and may be 
altered anytime before my passing.

216 ¶The tenor  of our Íaivite monastic order is clearly proclaimed in 
verse 176 of the Íaivite Íâstras:  “Saivism flourished through these years 
up until now, 1995. We look back and see a bursting forth from within 
many souls, like tulips burst forth from the soil in a fertile spring and 
then open in their beauty in their own good time. These Íaivite monas-tics  fulfilled their mission simply by existing. And so the natyam and 
sâ dhakas were not compelled to do a lot in the external world, other than 
fulfill the Íâstras and the Upanishads   of each of the four winds . Modera-
tion  was a keynote among these dedicated beings. They worked diligently 
to move their awareness with that of their guru’s, as was the tradition. 
They did not seek guidance from Deity, deva or saint. This came to them 
as a natural boon in unseen ways. They asked for help and assistance in 
their projects during pûjâ time from Deity and devas   alike, but, as is the 
tradition, no direct communication was given to them from Deity or devas  
or saints. This, of course, is traditional, as the  purpose is divine realization 
of the Self , being one with the guru, and not the development of personal 
psychic developments unless instructed by the guru. The devas and Deity 
were very careful not to develop this order into an order  of individual psy-
chics , which would lead each off the path into the dead-end and morass of 
ramifications. Therefore, they worked behind the veil, listening intently to 
the needs and fulfilling in unseen ways.”
About
DevonicGuidance 217 ¶A legacy of devas from the entire paramparâ accom-
panies our monastic order, providing silent, unseen inner 
guidance and protection for old and young alike.  As long 
as at least one person within the entire group of ma†havâsis  is going into 
and coming out of Paraßiva once a day, the doorway to the Third World 
remains open to the hereditary entourage of devonic forces that has been 
building up for over two thousand years. This is because the brahmaran-
dhra  remains open when Paraßiva is daily experienced within a ma†havâsi 
community. It could be within the oldest monk or within the youngest.

Chapter 12are full-time servants of the Divine, supported by part-time servants of

hold themselves at the center, hovering at the precipice of the Infinite Self, 
while others struggle to control the mind. They are truly the knowers of 
the Unknowable, holding Truth in the palm of their hands. No wonder we turn to them in times of sorrow, when in need of guidance and wise direc-tion, when our will seems weak or our spiritual perspective fades and the world seems all too real. That is how it is in our Church, as the next 
chapter will explain.

216 ¶The tenor  of our Íaivite monastic order is clearly proclaimed in 
verse 176 of the Íaivite Íâstras:  “Saivism flourished through these years 
up until now, 1995. We look back and see a bursting forth from within 
many souls, like tulips burst forth from the soil in a fertile spring and 
then open in their beauty in their own good time. These Íaivite monas-tics  fulfilled their mission simply by existing. And so the natyam and 
sâ dhakas were not compelled to do a lot in the external world, other than 
fulfill the Íâstras and the Upanishads   of each of the four winds . Modera-
tion  was a keynote among these dedicated beings. They worked diligently 
to move their awareness with that of their guru’s, as was the tradition. 
They did not seek guidance from Deity, deva or saint. This came to them 
as a natural boon in unseen ways. They asked for help and assistance in 
their projects during pûjâ time from Deity and devas   alike, but, as is the 
tradition, no direct communication was given to them from Deity or devas  
or saints. This, of course, is traditional, as the  purpose is divine realization 
of the Self , being one with the guru, and not the development of personal 
psychic developments unless instructed by the guru. The devas and Deity 
were very careful not to develop this order into an order  of individual psy-
chics , which would lead each off the path into the dead-end and morass of 
ramifications. Therefore, they worked behind the veil, listening intently to 
the needs and fulfilling in unseen ways.”
About
DevonicGuidance 217 ¶A legacy of devas from the entire paramparâ accom-
panies our monastic order, providing silent, unseen inner 
guidance and protection for old and young alike.  As long 
as at least one person within the entire group of ma†havâsis  is going into 
and coming out of Paraßiva once a day, the doorway to the Third World 
remains open to the hereditary entourage of devonic forces that has been 
building up for over two thousand years. This is because the brahmaran-
dhra  remains open when Paraßiva is daily experienced within a ma†havâsi 
community. It could be within the oldest monk or within the youngest.

hold themselves at the center, hovering at the precipice of the Infinite Self,

the Unknowable, holding Truth in the palm of their hands. No wonder we turn to them in times of sorrow, when in need of guidance and wise direc-tion, when our will seems weak or our spiritual perspective fades and the world seems all too real. That is how it is in our Church, as the next

Duties  And 
Responsibilities220 ¶In Íaiva Siddhânta Church, the monks are the 
full-time clergy and only formal staff. As full-time staff, 
monks serve in a number of capacities in six major areas:
1.  TEMPLES: Monks serve as priests in the temples of the Church, conduct-
ing the regular daily ceremonies, special festivals and sacraments for indi-
vidual members. Our traditional liturgy is conducted entirely in Sansk®it.
2.  MINISTRY AND TEACHING:  The monks serve as religious teachers and 
counselors to the Church’s members and students through telephone con-
tact, correspondence and personal visitations. 
3.  RELIGIOUS PUBLICATIONS: Monks serve in the area of publishing as writ-
ers, editors, designers and production managers for the Church’s teach-
ings. Through its publications arm, Himâlayan Academy Publications, the 
Church publishes the world’s only international monthly Hindu family 
magazine, H INDUISM  TODAY, with a readership of 250,000. Other publications 
include philosophical and spiritual textbooks, such as Dancing with Íiva, 
Living with Íiva and Merging with Íiva,  Saivite Hindu Religion, Loving 
Ga∫eßa, The Holy Bible of the Íaivite Hindu Religion and other books and 
pamphlets on Hinduism. 
4.  ADMINISTRATION: Certain monks serve in the administration offices over-
seeing the financial, legal and other managerial aspects of the Church’s 
work in the USA and abroad, including computer database, international 
franchises of H INDUISM  TODAY and publication sales. They also handle the 
budgets and purchasing needs of the Church’s various missions.
5.  MONASTERY CARE: The monastics are fully responsible for the care of 
the monastery they live and serve in. There is no permanent hired staff, though workers are occasionally employed for specific projects. Therefore, the monks share duties in such areas as cooking, housekeeping, building 
maintenance, gardening and harvesting, carpentry, animal husbandry 
and groundskeeping.
6.  PERSONAL SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINES: Monks live a disciplined life which 
in addition to their assigned duties includes daily meditation and wor-
ship, scriptural study, philosophical discourses and personal yoga practices 
assigned them by their guru.

Overview of
Our Ma†havâsiTradition 218 ¶What is a monk ? According to Webster’s Dictionary, 
a monk is “a man who joins a religious order living in a 
monastery according to a rule and under vows.” In Íaiva 
Siddhânta Church there are two categories of ordained monks:
1. Postulants : These are monks who take vows for two years at a time, the 
four vows of humility, purity, obedience and confidence. Postulants who 
meet the qualifications and have expressed a desire to take lifetime vows 
receive special pre-renunciate training. 
2.  Swâmîs : Also known as sannyâsins or renunciates, these are monks 
who have taken vows for a lifetime, generally after ten or more years of 
training. They take five vows: the above four plus a vow of poverty.
Both categories of monks live and work together. Except when traveling, 
they always reside in one of the Church’s monasteries, meaning Kauai Aad-
heenam or one of its branches, called dharmaßâlas. Monks  are unsalaried, 
and their needs for food, clothing, health care, etc., are provided by the 
Church. Kauai Aadheenam is a strictly supervised all-male cloister, as is 
each of its branch monasteries. Monks do not leave the property except for approved activities.
The Schedule
Of OurMonasteries219 ¶Like monasteries and priest schools in South India, 
Kauai Aadheenam and its branch monasteries follow a 
lunar calendar. The monks follow a strict monastic rou-
tine which includes rising at 4:30am to attend a 5:30 to 7:15 Íiva pûjâ and 
Shum meditation, as well as the daily performance of personal spiritual 
disciplines such as scriptural study and the various yogas, and exercise. 
 Roughly two days out of seven are reserved for religious disciplines, per-
sonal care, âßrama upkeep and beautification, study and rest. The monas-
tery “workday” begins at 8:00am and ends at 6:30pm, with a 2-hour break 
for lunch and rest from 1:00 to 3:00pm. Group meals are served at 7:30am, 
1:00 pm and 6:30 pm. Instructive discourses are given at the main meals, 
as part of the on-going education of all residents. The monks gather for discussion, seminars, religious singing and TV each evening from approxi-
mately 7:00 to 9:00. Lights are out at 9:00pm.

because of the departure of the senior naishtika brahmachâri∫î, whose 
presence was essential to the âßrama’s existence. T o this day such an âßra-

âßramas in the future.

are postulants living under renewable two-year vows of 
humility, purity, confidence and obedience. They are both preparing for holy orders of sannyâsa. The yogîs wear yellow robes, one to two strands 
of rudrâksha beads and carry a wooden staff, or da∫∂a —symbolic of 
the training and tapas they have undertaken to purify their outer nature. 
The sâdhakas dress in white robes. Junior sâdhakas  wear a sandalwood 
mâlâ, and seniors wear a single strand of rudrâksha beads. The yogîs  and 
sâ dhakas, like the swâmîs, serve at Kauai Aadheenam or at branch mon-
asteries under the direction of the Guru Mahâsannidhânam, the âchâryas

groups of monks, resident guests and guests, distinguished 
by unique vestments indicating levels of initiation and 
attainment . When sitting among other groups in a chakravâla , the seating 
order is as follows. First are the Íaiva swâmîs, seated according to brahm-
acharya age. Second are the nirvâ∫a sâdhakas, seated according to mon-
astic age. Third are the natyam, seated according to monastic age. Fourth 
are the young sâdhakas, also seated according to monastic age. Fifth are 
the yogis, all of whom are six monastic years of age, seated according 
to physical age. Sixth come the supplicants, seated according to physical 
age, then aspirants, seated according to physical age. Seventh are the upa-

any g®ihâstha guests who may be present in the circle, seated according

Our Íâstric
Pattern forNuns 229 ¶Our Íaivite Íâstras  outlined a pattern for a 
brahmachâri∫î âßrama  within our Church. Here is a 
central passage, from verses 196–197: “Brahmachâri∫î  
followed exactly the same pattern in an âßrama  that was never entered

On TravelingIncognito231 ¶Incognito  means no one knows who you are, where 
you are from, what is your past, your mission or your 
future. It means remaining invisible and anonymous. For 
our ma†havâsis, traveling incognito  also means avoiding contact with indi-
viduals or organizations who are friends of the Church. It means not teach-
ing or giving public talks. It means passing through without being noticed. 
It means not initiating conversation with the person in the next seat. It 
means not giving out religious literature, but reading scripture and per-
forming japa on one’s beads. It means not drawing attention to oneself in 
any way. This is the sâdhana. To do otherwise is to set patterns in the âkâßa

Training andProtocol238 ¶A formal, progressive pre-monastic regimen which 
leads the ßishya through the stages of aspirant and suppli-
cant into the postulancy is also available for those eager 
to eventually take holy orders of sannyâsa. Sponsorship  is given by senior 
kulapati by placing their signatures on the candidate’s pre-monastic vow 
document, indicating endorsement of him as suitable for monastic life. 
Aspirants  are encouraged to live for short or long periods of time in a 
temple within their own country before entering a formal monastery. Dur-
ing this time they wear white and strive to fulfill the pledge of purity. Sup-
plicants , intent on entering the Postulancy, live under the additional pledg-
es of humility and obedience. Postulants and premonastics study Holy 
Orders of Sannyâsa  daily to enhance their understanding and fulfillment 
of renunciate life. Y oung boys  strongly inclined toward the monastic path 
may leave their own home for a time and be raised instead in the home 
of a brahmachârî couple, as indicated in Íaivite Íâstra verse 192 : “It was 
in these two [types of brahmacharya] families that their guru sent very 
young sâdhakas,  ten, twelve, thirteen, fourteen years old, to have initial 
training. They were sent only after two years of brahmacharya had been 
mastered by the family and the forces within the family well adjusted.”  
Because training must be given when the nature is still young and pliable, 
we do not accept candidates for monastic life who are over the age of 25.
The 
Upakurvâ∫aProgram239 ¶Upakurvâ∫a ßishyas  are young men between the 
ages of 11 and 21 devoting six months serving their religion at Kauai Aadheenam or a branch monastery , or through 
a missionary program, prior to path choosing. Upakurvâ∫a  means “prior 
to taking up one’s profession.” The upakurvâ∫a program  is open only to 
young men from homes of well established Church families who have 
raised their sons to be worthy of the upakurvâ∫a training, as stated in 
sûtra 285: “My family devotees raise their sons to be worthy of  en tering my 
monastery for two years to  serve, study and grow in  character as they live 
the monk’s selfless life. This is the ideal for all  young men. Aum Nama˙ 
Íivâya.” Before university is the best time to enter into this period of ser-
vice, sâdhana and study, which is meant to establish and strengthen the 
youth’s personal spiritual connection to the Paramparâ. It has been proven 
through the years that excellent monastics as well as householders come 
from the experience of living with and being trained by the Íaiva monas-
tics in the arts of worship, the disciplines of yoga and the daily unrelent-
ing routine which is traditional to the life of the ma†havâsi. He learns to 
Sunless and demonic,

RenunciateCommitments236 ¶A life of discipline is not an easy life, but it is a 
joyous one with many soul-satisfying rewards. Monastics 
follow their rigorous 24-hour protocol even in their dreams. 
It is not easy, and those who are born to perform this service are to be respected and not distracted by family pulls or the desires of former friends. T ested, yes, in their beginning years, to be assured that their com-
mitment is firm, their energies secure and their loyalties well understood. 
Traditionally at this time family and friends play an important role by 
bringing temptations to them and valid reasons why they should renounce 
renunciation. But when their robes turn to yellow or when in white the 
rudrâksha beads are worn, their path is clear and a new protocol on both 
sides must be firmly kept. All relationships have now changed.  
Sannyâsa:
The Spirit ofAll Ma†havâsis237 ¶The Íaiva sannyâsin states at the time of his initia-
tion, “ All that I have and all that I am I now give unto my 
God, my Gods and my guru. I have no family except the 
Divine Father Íiva and Mother Íakti who dwell in Kailâsa and on earth 
the sa˜gam of Íaivite devotees.” This is the ideal of not only the swâmî, 
but of all monks. Therefore, a state of aloofness from blood ties must be 
maintained on the part of each monastic. This is reflected in the proto-
col of the monk’s not referring to relatives as “my father,” “my brother,” 
“my mother,” but by formal, impersonal names , such as Mr. Íivanesan, etc. 
This is an affectionate detachment, a lovingly detached attitude, from the 
g®ihastha community. It is a detachment from joint or extended family, 
which includes former friends, seeing guru as mother and father, and fel-
low monastics as family, aadheenam devas as dear relatives, and Gods as 
close, not far away. Each family learns to respect this renunciate attitude. 
This is the fabric of monastic life, both for sannyâsins and postulants, for 
in our community, all are on the path of renunciation . Some have received 
sannyâsa dîkshâ  and others are preparing for it by fully living the life of 
the one who has renounced the world in one-pointed quest for service and 
God Realization.

Training andProtocol238 ¶A formal, progressive pre-monastic regimen which 
leads the ßishya through the stages of aspirant and suppli-
cant into the postulancy is also available for those eager 
to eventually take holy orders of sannyâsa. Sponsorship  is given by senior 
kulapati by placing their signatures on the candidate’s pre-monastic vow 
document, indicating endorsement of him as suitable for monastic life. 
Aspirants  are encouraged to live for short or long periods of time in a 
temple within their own country before entering a formal monastery. Dur-
ing this time they wear white and strive to fulfill the pledge of purity. Sup-
plicants , intent on entering the Postulancy, live under the additional pledg-
es of humility and obedience. Postulants and premonastics study Holy 
Orders of Sannyâsa  daily to enhance their understanding and fulfillment 
of renunciate life. Y oung boys  strongly inclined toward the monastic path 
may leave their own home for a time and be raised instead in the home 
of a brahmachârî couple, as indicated in Íaivite Íâstra verse 192 : “It was 
in these two [types of brahmacharya] families that their guru sent very 
young sâdhakas,  ten, twelve, thirteen, fourteen years old, to have initial 
training. They were sent only after two years of brahmacharya had been 
mastered by the family and the forces within the family well adjusted.”  
Because training must be given when the nature is still young and pliable, 
we do not accept candidates for monastic life who are over the age of 25.
The 
Upakurvâ∫aProgram239 ¶Upakurvâ∫a ßishyas  are young men between the 
ages of 11 and 21 devoting six months serving their religion at Kauai Aadheenam or a branch monastery , or through 
a missionary program, prior to path choosing. Upakurvâ∫a  means “prior 
to taking up one’s profession.” The upakurvâ∫a program  is open only to 
young men from homes of well established Church families who have 
raised their sons to be worthy of the upakurvâ∫a training, as stated in 
sûtra 285: “My family devotees raise their sons to be worthy of  en tering my 
monastery for two years to  serve, study and grow in  character as they live 
the monk’s selfless life. This is the ideal for all  young men. Aum Nama˙ 
Íivâya.” Before university is the best time to enter into this period of ser-
vice, sâdhana and study, which is meant to establish and strengthen the 
youth’s personal spiritual connection to the Paramparâ. It has been proven 
through the years that excellent monastics as well as householders come 
from the experience of living with and being trained by the Íaiva monas-
tics in the arts of worship, the disciplines of yoga and the daily unrelent-
ing routine which is traditional to the life of the ma†havâsi. He learns to 
Sunless and demonic,

acceptance into a monastery as a Supplicant pre-monastic to be raised and educated in a monastery of the Church and be considered the satguru’s prog-

Candidates’Worthiness242 ¶Even if monasticism is embraced in the Ish†a Mârga 
rite, this is no guarantee of acceptance into a monastery, for he must be a renunciate by nature as well as by desire 
and have no close blood relative or personal family attachments within the 
monasteries. Our Dravidian Íâstras  emphasize strictness in accepting young 
aspirants . V erse 395 explains, “Surrounding each of our monasteries there 
are, of course, sâdhaka  sent by family men who had trained them for 
entrance, begging admittance  for the first time into the monastery. They 
were kept by the wall  for long periods of time before being admitted. Each 
moon they were given a philosophical examination and a close look at 
their deportment and conduct and fulfilling of the ßâstras in their own life. 
Occasionally some were sent back to the family who had trained them 
for additional acquisition of accomplishments in certain areas. During 
this time they were always encouraged and shown great love and kind-
ness, for it was important that the monasteries gain new sâdhaka  in order 
for our culture to persist. But this effort to increase our population and 
begin new monasteries did not in any way lower our standards.” V erse 
400 emphasizes how the family communities appreciate these high stan-
dards, “It was the family educators of young monastics who were always appreciative of high and difficult standards arrived at by individual mon-asteries, and they would tell young potential sâdhaka  studying with them 
in their homes of the difficulties in entering one or another of them and 
the reasons why. This became a part of their training and is a part of our 
culture. These high standards, which set certain monasteries apart from others, strengthen Íaivism on this planet.”

live in Church family homes and come to the monastery daily to serve, or

tery forcefield, on nearby but nonadjoining property owned by the Church. 
In either case, they live with the families during all phasely retreat days. During  sâdhu paksha,  upakurvâ∫îs may continue residing in the devasthâ-
nam during the phase and staying with the families on retreat days. Part 
of the upakurvâ∫a experience is to visit our dharmaßâlas  and the homes 
of kulapati families worldwide.  
Raising a
Son for the Monastery240 ¶All must always remember that it is a family’s great-
est blessing for a son to become a sannyâsin. But a word of 
caution must follow. Though a young man may be raised as 
a monk, it is he himself who has to have the burning desire for ultimate, 
transcendent realization of Paraßiva. It is he who must have a heart full of 
selfless service and vairâgya, the spirit of renunciation. It is he who must 
have the prârabdha karmas  that would allow him to be the ideal sannyâ-
sin his parents would hope for. Becoming a monk is not simply a matter 
of moving from his family home into a monastery. V arious tests must be 
met and passed. The entire monastic community has to be convinced of 
the young man’s sincerity and strengthened by his presence. With this in 
mind it is easy to see why only six-month pledges are given during the 
pre-monastic time of testing before two-year vows are taken and renewed 
again and again before lifetime holy orders are given. At each juncture, 
new decisions are made, the karmas reviewed and commitments to the 
sannyâsin  path made firm. 
Path-

go on to their higher education, family life and careers. 
A rare few elect to pursue the renunciate’s path. After he 
returns home  it is time for the young man to think over his life and make 
a firm choice between the two paths, that of the g®ihasthin and that of 
the sannyâsin. This decision, once made by the son and his parents, is 
formalized before the community through the path-choosing rite, Ish†a

time he’s primarily trained by the pattern his father sets for him, or he’s taken by a guru  from his family home and placed in the home of a brah-

enter the monastery. With special permission,  a young soul might enter 
this family’s household as early as nine or ten years of age, and the mon-

if any attachment exists after the age of 24 other than love, respect and

up to the age of 24, he’s accepted into one of our Íaivite 
monasteries after proving himself, ha ving settled his worldly affairs and 
obtained the good feeling of mother and father as the diminishing attach-

simply courteously and lovingly beg leave of his mother, father and friends

247 ¶The United Nations  rightly describes the family as the basic unit of 
society, performing essential socio-economic functions. It is “the primary source of nurturing, as well as a conduit for the transmission of values, 
culture and information.” All nations know that one criminal can do much damage. Avoiding the creation of criminals is one of the services the fam-

transmitter of values and knowledge. The family is the basic survival unit. 
Fundamental
Unit: the Joint Family248 ¶The joint family  is the core family group. It is human 
society’s most essential element, consisting of several gen-
erations of kindred living together under the same roof or 
in an adjoining compound. Traditionally, joint families live in a large sin-
gle home, but in modern times accommodations are often in individual, 
nuclear homes within a shared compound. The joint family includes the 
father and mother, sons, grandsons and great-grandsons with their spouses, 
as well as the daughters, granddaughters and great-granddaughters until 
marriage. Thus it often comprises several married couples and their chil-
dren. The head of the joint family, called ku†umba mukhya (also mukhya 
or kart®i), is the father, supported by the mother, and in his absence, the 
elder son, guided by his mother and supported by his spouse. From an early age, the eldest son  is given special training by his father to assume 
this future responsibility as head of the family. In the event of the father’s 
death, sacred law does allow for the splitting of the family wealth between 
the sons. Division of family assets may also be necessary in cases where 
sons are involved in different professions and live in different towns, when 
there is an inability for all to get along under one roof, or when the family 
becomes unmanageably large. Each individual family of husband, wife 
and children is under the guidance of the head of the joint family. All work 
together unselfishly to further the common good. The main characteristics 
of the joint family are that its members: 1) share a common residence, 
2) partake of food prepared in the same kitchen, 3) hold their property in 
common and, 4) ideally, profess the same religion, sect and sampradâya.

Guidance
From the Íaivite Íâstras252 ¶In writing the Íaivite Íâstras in 1973, the inner-plane 
masters looked forward to 1995 and gave the following 
overview, in verses 211, as to how families of the fellow-
ship should conduct their lives so as to maintain the core of sublimity 
within their homes. “The surrounding community always took its pattern 
from the monastery itself. The parents, the senior minority, humble and 
transparent, yet firm in seeing their home was connected to the ßakti flow 
of the monastery’s temple, raised the children in a similar way that the 
monastics were trained. The son became the apprentice  of the father, the 
daughter the apprentice of the mother.” 
Family 
Purpose andTraining253 ¶V erse 212 of the Íaivite Íâstras  defines the purpose of 
each family: “The existence of the Íaivite  family was for the 
perpetuation of their religion, its vibration and its tenets, 
through the living of it. They observed all days when the Deity’s power was 
strong and participated at every opportunity with other Íaivites ’round the 
world. Through association with orthodox Íaivites of India and Sri Lanka, 
Western Íaivite  families found a deeper protocol. This intermingling was 
encouraged by the guru , as there was no set pattern for the families to 
follow, other than the swâmî  encouraging families to shape the pattern 
of their lives as closely to the monastery monastic ßâstric flow itself. In 
doing so, the Deities  and devas  worked in the exact same way with the 
families as they did with the natyam  and sâdhaka .” V erses 213-214 explain 
that “The guru worked with the families in the same way he worked with 
a single monastery. Each family’s household was looked at as a complete 
monastery if it had two or more children.…There was little formal teach-
ing of the families as to how they should live. This knowledge was picked 
up here and there and everywhere and through observation, reading of 
the Íâstras  and the association with well established Íaivite  families.”

And ExtendedFamily 249 ¶Each joint family extends out from its home to 
include a second level of connections as an “extended fam-ily,” b®ihatku†umba or mahâku†umba, consisting of one or 
more joint families plus their broader associations and affiliations. Unlike 
the joint family, whose members live in close proximity, the extended fam-
ily is often geographically widespread. Each extended family is headed by 
a patriarch, called kulapati  in our fellowship, who is one of the joint fami-
ly mukhyas  recognized as the leader by all in the joint families of his clan. 
He and all in the family are in turn under the guidance of the kula guru, 
or family preceptor . Traditionally, extended families include, in order of 
precedence: priests of the faith; elder men and women of the community; 
in-laws of married daughters; married daughters, granddaughters, great-
granddaughters and the spouses and children of these married girls; mem-
bers of the staff and their families and those closely associated with the 
joint family business or home; maternal great-grandparents and grandpar-
ents, parents, uncles and their spouses, aunts and their spouses, children and grandchildren of these families; very close friends and their children and members of the community at large. In all traditional cultures, each 
joint family extends out from itself as an extended family.
The Extended
Families of Our Fellowship250 ¶In our Church, all nonmonastic ßishyas, be they 
married, single, brahmachârî or brahmachâri∫î, are part 
of one of our extended families , b®ihat ku†umba . Fifty-four 
b®ihat ku†umbas  were established at the start of 1994. There will be more 
in the years ahead. These families differ from the traditional extended 
family in that they are made up of joint families not necessarily related by 
blood or marriage. Rather, they are related and bound together by mutual 
commitment to the Kailâsa Paramparâ and by their karmas from former 
lives. “There are no accidents in Íiva’s perfect universe.“ Each Church 
b®ihat ku†umba  includes spiritual members unrelated by blood or mar-
riage, such as orphans, widows, avowed brahmachârîs and brahmachâri∫îs, 
married couples, and men or women whose spouses are not Church mem-
bers and ßishyas in the wisdom years of sannyâsa âßrama . Each of these 
individuals is either a foster or adoptive member of a kulapati family . 
The Leaders
Of ExtendedFamilies251 ¶Each b®ihat ku†umba  is built around a senior and 
mature ku†umba in which both husband and wife are dedi-

end of this six-month-and-nine-day residency the foster member is deemed 
by the joint family to be an adoptive, thirty-nine days must elapse before he or she returns to reside permanently in the home.  
The Written
AdoptionAgreement258 ¶During the one month apart from the family, a writ-
ten agreement is drawn up with blessings from the Pî†ham. 
The adoption is formalized and acknowledged through spe-
cial ceremony. The resident guest flow described above is given in the 
Íaivite Íâstras,  which govern our monasteries. It is implemented here for 
families to ensure full devonic support within each home. The covenant 
between the adoptive and the heads of the family explains the expecta-
tions of all parties, the duties, responsibilities, rules and financial arrange-
ments. In drawing up the agreement, factors to consider include: 1) astro-
logical compatibility charts between the adoptive and family members; 
2) frank disclosure of biographical information, especially personal prob-
lems, including health and finances. During the adoption ceremony, an 
archana is performed invoking the blessings of the Gods, and the covenant 
is signed by both parties. Four copies are made. One is kept by the family, 
one is kept by the adoptive, one is sent to the Aadhee nam, and one to the 
Devaloka through the sacred fire. The covenant is automatically voided if 
an adoptive or the hosting family withdraws from Church membership. 
Family
MondayEvening259 ¶Family togetherness is a key to a healthy, welcoming, 
loving family. It is essential for the immediate family to 
meet each Monday evening, the day on which family devas  
are commissioned to be active in the pretaloka, close to the physical world 
to assist the family in forming strong, vibrant connections for a dynamic, 
healthy, wealthy future. As explained in sûtra 90: “Each of Íiva’s devotees 
who is a husband spends time with his wife and children daily.  Monday is 
a  family eve ning at home. One night monthly is de voted to the wife alone 
in an activity of her choice. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.” This evening at home is a family event for permanent residents, foster-members and overnight 
guests. The family devas must be thought of and invoked on kula soma-
vâra sâya,  for Monday is their day to come close to their immediate family.

this context, we define adult as age 20 and older. Guest stays may be lon-
ger for those who are younger . Such guests should either be Church mem-
bers or arulßishyas. It is naturally expected that they fit into the family as 
proper sons or daughters. It is discretionary how long they should stay, but 
wisdom suggests a maximum of 39 days, especially for anyone who is no 
longer a virgin. Tradition sets other guidelines for guests in the home. For 
example, a widow with daughters would not invite male guests who had entered puberty. Church families whose homes do not meet mission-house 
standards should not accept as overnight guests Church members, Acad-
emy students or other Church guests. 
Adoptive
FamilyMembers 255 ¶Sûtra 133 states, “Íiva’s followers know the most sta-
ble  societies are based on the extended  family. They often 
merge individuals with families and families with families 
in one home or complex, for economy, sharing and religiousness. Aum.” 
This aphorism encompasses the spiritual adoptive, g®ihatâ˜ga,  who lives 
in the kulapati’s  home under a detailed, formal, written agreement. Adop-
tives are treated not as a guests but as close family. Thus, they share in 
household chores and concerns and contribute financially as well. 
Foster 
Family Members 256 ¶Spiritual foster members, poshitâ˜gas, reside out-
side the home, relying on the strength and guidance of the 
extended family and participating occasionally in Family 
Monday Evening, especially during festival times . They may visit their 
kulapati family and live in the family home as members of the family 
whenever it is convenient. Their relationship with the family is as close as 
that of an aunt or uncle. Spiritual foster members may be Church mem-
bers or arulßishyas . Overnight stays in the kulapati home are limited to 
three nights for arulßishyas. Church members may, at the discretion of the 
family, stay as guest in their kulapati home for up to nine nights. Foster 
members include: 1) single individuals, 2 ) entire families in the beginning 
stages of membership and 3) married persons whose spouses are not mem-
bers. A minimum of 39 nights must elapse between such overnight stays.
The Process
Of SpiritualAdoption 257 ¶Adoptive residents of a kulapati family are generally 
single individuals who would otherwise live alone. In order 
to be adopted into an extended family as a full-time resi-
dent, a ßishya  must first complete a six-month-and-nine-day trial period as 
a foster member. The visit is reviewed after the initial nine days, and up 
to one month is added if all is going well. When that month has elapsed,

ger for those who are younger . Such guests should either be Church mem-
bers or arulßishyas. It is naturally expected that they fit into the family as 
proper sons or daughters. It is discretionary how long they should stay, but 
wisdom suggests a maximum of 39 days, especially for anyone who is no 
longer a virgin. Tradition sets other guidelines for guests in the home. For 
example, a widow with daughters would not invite male guests who had entered puberty. Church families whose homes do not meet mission-house 
standards should not accept as overnight guests Church members, Acad-
emy students or other Church guests. 
Adoptive
FamilyMembers 255 ¶Sûtra 133 states, “Íiva’s followers know the most sta-
ble  societies are based on the extended  family. They often 
merge individuals with families and families with families 
in one home or complex, for economy, sharing and religiousness. Aum.” 
This aphorism encompasses the spiritual adoptive, g®ihatâ˜ga,  who lives 
in the kulapati’s  home under a detailed, formal, written agreement. Adop-
tives are treated not as a guests but as close family. Thus, they share in 
household chores and concerns and contribute financially as well. 
Foster 
Family Members 256 ¶Spiritual foster members, poshitâ˜gas, reside out-
side the home, relying on the strength and guidance of the 
extended family and participating occasionally in Family 
Monday Evening, especially during festival times . They may visit their 
kulapati family and live in the family home as members of the family 
whenever it is convenient. Their relationship with the family is as close as 
that of an aunt or uncle. Spiritual foster members may be Church mem-
bers or arulßishyas . Overnight stays in the kulapati home are limited to 
three nights for arulßishyas. Church members may, at the discretion of the 
family, stay as guest in their kulapati home for up to nine nights. Foster 
members include: 1) single individuals, 2 ) entire families in the beginning 
stages of membership and 3) married persons whose spouses are not mem-
bers. A minimum of 39 nights must elapse between such overnight stays.
The Process
Of SpiritualAdoption 257 ¶Adoptive residents of a kulapati family are generally 
single individuals who would otherwise live alone. In order 
to be adopted into an extended family as a full-time resi-
dent, a ßishya  must first complete a six-month-and-nine-day trial period as 
a foster member. The visit is reviewed after the initial nine days, and up 
to one month is added if all is going well. When that month has elapsed,

The Familymembers is similar to the ever-increasing population of devas within an 
aadheenam or dharmaßâla as it matures through the years. If the family 
stops their sâdhana during brâhma muhûrta , however, the home loses its 
magnetism, its spiritual power. The array of devas begins to slowly drift 
away, some returning to the temples whence they came, others performing duties elsewhere, among righteous families that invoke their presence. In 
the vacuum left by their departure, asuras  move in and begin to take over 
the home, causing argument among family members and the inability to 
see eye to eye. It is often asked how to know if devas or asuras are in a 
home. An easy test is through feeling. Does the home feel full, secure, har-
monious? Or does it feel empty, insecure and contentious? That is all we need to know to determine who the astral inhabitants are. 
Families 
Living Near A Monastery 264 ¶Church  families who live close to the Aadheenam or 
a dharmaßâla are very fortunate to be in such proximity 
to the central ßakti flow radiating out from these sacred 
sanctuaries of sâdhana and pûjâ.  Theirs is the blessing to be able to wor-
ship and meditate daily at the holy tîrthas. And theirs is the boon to be 
relied upon to perform service, ma†haseva , for the monastery. This may 
include hosting visiting swâmîs, pilgrims, important people and truth 
seekers, giving hospitality, lodging and transportation; preparing prasâda, 
cooking for gatherings, harvesting produce, caring for certain areas of the 
grounds, sewing, making garlands and other decorations for festivals and 
more. Hosting for Church guests, be it for short visits or overnight stays, is 
done in homes where both husband and wife and all permanent residents are fellowship ßishyas . The blessings come in the performance of these 
expected services. These families so blessed are regarded as pillars of the 
fellowship and are responsible to see that their offspring are always the 
best examples to the community at large.  
Duties of
Kulapatis andKulamâtâs 265 ¶It is the responsibility of each kulapati to gen-
tly implement our articles of faith and conduct within 
his extended family, including the Five Precepts, Five 
Practices, Five Parenting Guidelines and the 365 Nandinâtha Sûtras 
so that by fulfilling dharma each family member attains life’s three 
other goals: artha, “prosperity;” kâma, “pleasure;” and moksha, enlight-
enment and liberation from rebirth.  A great weight is placed upon the

At a LocalÍaivite Temple 261 ¶The temple should be visited for devout worship at 
least once a week. In most communities, Friday  is honored 
as a special day to visit the temple . This is also a time of 
family togetherness, when all join in devout pilgrimage to a temple near 
or far, having prepared mentally, bathed properly and made or purchased offerings for the Gods and dressed in their finest Hindu clothing. As our 
Íaivite Íâstras  state in verse 293: “The families were carefully guided into 
areas where temples existed for their frequent pilgrimage, worship and 
security. It was not considered right that families live further than a day’s 
journey to a Íaivite temple, and that temple was open every day.”

and the  satguru’s   tiruvadi . This is the home’s most beautiful room. Aum.” 
The home shrine is an extension of the temple. It is the spiritual core of the 
home, where the entire family gathers each morning for pûjâ and medita-
tion. The placement of the Deities in the home shrine is as follows: at the 
left is Lord Ga∫eßa, to the right is Lord Murugan. In the center, from back 
to front, are Íiva Na†arâja, Íivali˜ga and tiruvadi, the holy sandals of the

Rules of theFellowship268 ¶166-170 summarize our central ethics for conducting 
business within the fellowship, based on injunctions given

My Church members may employ other members, provided payment is 
made promptly each Friday. They may receive blessings to go into business 
with one another if their relationships are harmonious and spiritual. Aum.
2.  S¨TRA 167 , CONTRACTS AND ARBITRATION
My worldly-wise devotees never enter into business trans actions with-
out a written  contract. In cases of dispute, they avoid  courts of law and 
seek judgment from an  arbitration board within their  community. Aum.
3. S¨TRA 168, NOT BORROWING OR GIVING CREDIT
My devotees, to safeguard harmony, never borrow or lend  mon ey among 
themselves or give  credit to one an other, even for interest. They may do 
business together, but only through immediate cash transactions. Aum. 
4. S¨TRA 169, TREATMENT OF EMPLOYEES AND SERV ANTS 
My devotees treat  servants and  employ ees honorably, as they would 
members of their own family, never neglecting or taking advantage of 
them. They provide conditions that are safe, healthful and uplifting. Aum.
5. S¨TRA 170, BORROWING FROM OTHERS
My wise devotees never borrow from a   mon  astery or temple. They may 
 borrow belongings from other devotees, provided objects are returned 
within twenty-four hours after the purpose is fulfilled. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.

the spirit of global strength, the kulapatis are encouraged to know person-

Íaiva souls to fully convert to Íaivism. The distribution of publications, 
the planning of yearly pilgrimages, festivals and much more is what these 
kulapati families are inspired, by the great beings in the inner worlds, to 
accomplish individually and collectively. It is the good conduct and stead-

RetirementYears267 ¶When Church family members reach the sannyâsa

pursuits which focus on the eternal truths of the Veda s and their satguru’s 
teachings.  Theirs is a position of respect, and their advice is listened to. 
When they are among the kulapatis, they may say little, yet their every

The Familythe fellowship was gradually discontinued and eventually eliminated. All 
current agreements as of 1995 were considered to expire no later than the 
kumbhâbhisheka of Iraivan T emple, and in the meantime no new arrange-
ments were made. 
Caution of 
Growing tooLarge or Fast271 ¶The ma†havâsis were admonished not to allow their 
institutions, Kauai Aadheenam and its dharmaßâlas to grow 
faster or larger than they themselves could easily manage. 
Not being able to hire members and students and not wanting undue out-
side influences, forces and projects to burden the monastery, each talaivar 
began to limit by design the service of his kulam within the capabilities of 
the monks allotted. This slowly reduced the need for hiring current or for-
mer fellowship members and students for any reason. However, nonmem-
bers were sometimes hired, part-time or full-time, for various tasks that the 
monks could not perform. The freedom to dismiss employed nonmembers 
without hurt feelings was beneficial, and the giving of work outside the 
membership was much appreciated by the community at large. 
Emphasis
On ServiceGiven Freely272 ¶Building, gardening and typing the sacred texts in 
their homes are some of the many ways in which Church 
members may perform Íivathondu . These have in years 
past proven to grant satisfaction and rewards of pu∫ya . The members’ 
many contributions have been an important connection for them to Íiva’s 
sacred work and a positive way they have helped their Church. Our para-
maguru Y ogaswâmî’s Íivathondan Society , founded in 1935, always had its 
members serve food and perform other loving, humble tasks. 
Hiring of
ProfessionalNon-Members273 ¶Similarly, all involvements in Íaiva Siddhânta 
Church are kept on a simple, nonworldly level. Members 
are never allowed to become involved in the intricacies of 
managing the Church , HHE, Himâlayan Academy and other institutions, 
for this would involve too close an outer relationship with the ma†havâsis. 
Thus it is that all professional services  for the monasteries are to be pro-
vided by competent people outside the Church membership, and this prin-
ciple applies equally and in all instances to students of Himâlayan Acad-emy. These include medical, legal, business, computer, financial, public 
relations needs and similar categories. 
Ma†havâsis’
UpholdingResponsibility274 ¶The ma†havâsis had been trained in, and in the future 
shall uphold, the edict that they handle all funds and busi-
ness themselves, never relinquishing those key responsibili-
ties to others, however qualified or willing they may be. The monks are 
That splendor that 
resides in an elephant, in a king, among men, or within the waters, with which the Gods in the beginning  came to Godhood, with that same  splendor make me splendid, O Lord.
ATHARV A VEDA 3.22.3. VE, 344About 
UnresolvedDebts 269 ¶The Pî†ham developed a unique way of resolving 
matters when transactions persisted beyond three days 
between family and family or monastery and family. The 
prâyaßchitta  to remove the stress between the two parties was to increase 
the amount owed by one per cent each day the payment was delayed. Sim-
ilarly, there developed a unique prâyaßchitta to compensate the mental 
strain that personal money-lending creates within the fellowship. When 
the Íâstras were not heeded and loans were made and not repaid, when 
the matter came before the Pî†ham, the loan was always considered a gift 
from the lending family to the recipient family. Should remorse later set in 
and the borrowing family wish to repay the debt to resolve the karma, the 
money was always directed into the Hindu Heritage Endowment to benefit 
the Kauai ma†havâsis. This strong penance put a halt to much worldliness 
which could occur as the families became closer and more trusting of 
each other. This penance  is based on similar practices within the Chettiar 
community of South India, who learned to renounce unpaid debts and to 
give to a Lord Murugan Koyil any payment that comes after that renuncia-
tion. Equally important was the giving of credit. The sûtras admonish us 
to effect “cash and carry,“ and no form of credit  was allowed. However, 
there were times when businesses and families gave credit for services 
rendered and goods provided. When such matters came before the Pî†ham, 
the prâyaß chitta always was that if payment was not received within 180 
days, which is six months, the books were wiped clean. Again should pay-
ment occur due to the remorse of the receiver, it was given to the Hindu 
Heritage Endowment to benefit the Kauai ma†havâsis. This alone brought 
much mental freedom and as a result attracted great wealth. 
On the 
Hiring ofMembers 270 ¶The Church’s hiring of skilled labor among our mem-
bership did serve a worthwhile purpose for a few years before 1995. However, as more and more came closer to the 
monasteries, it became obvious that this was not to be continued for many 
good reasons. First, not all could be hired, and favoritism was damaging 
to the sâdhana of all. Secondly, payment within a 72-hour period, a disci-
pline required by our Íâstras, was inconsistent with office procedures and 
difficult to administrate. Thirdly, as all had vowed to uphold the*365 54 
sûtras that set forth the ideals of Íivathondu  and seva , there arose an unac-
ceptable disparity between members who served for no compensation and others who were paid, a condition that was unfair to one and all alike. For 
these several reasons, the hiring of skilled and unskilled helpers within

The Familythe fellowship was gradually discontinued and eventually eliminated. All 
current agreements as of 1995 were considered to expire no later than the 
kumbhâbhisheka of Iraivan T emple, and in the meantime no new arrange-
ments were made. 
Caution of 
Growing tooLarge or Fast271 ¶The ma†havâsis were admonished not to allow their 
institutions, Kauai Aadheenam and its dharmaßâlas to grow 
faster or larger than they themselves could easily manage. 
Not being able to hire members and students and not wanting undue out-
side influences, forces and projects to burden the monastery, each talaivar 
began to limit by design the service of his kulam within the capabilities of 
the monks allotted. This slowly reduced the need for hiring current or for-
mer fellowship members and students for any reason. However, nonmem-
bers were sometimes hired, part-time or full-time, for various tasks that the 
monks could not perform. The freedom to dismiss employed nonmembers 
without hurt feelings was beneficial, and the giving of work outside the 
membership was much appreciated by the community at large. 
Emphasis
On ServiceGiven Freely272 ¶Building, gardening and typing the sacred texts in 
their homes are some of the many ways in which Church 
members may perform Íivathondu . These have in years 
past proven to grant satisfaction and rewards of pu∫ya . The members’ 
many contributions have been an important connection for them to Íiva’s 
sacred work and a positive way they have helped their Church. Our para-
maguru Y ogaswâmî’s Íivathondan Society , founded in 1935, always had its 
members serve food and perform other loving, humble tasks. 
Hiring of
ProfessionalNon-Members273 ¶Similarly, all involvements in Íaiva Siddhânta 
Church are kept on a simple, nonworldly level. Members 
are never allowed to become involved in the intricacies of 
managing the Church , HHE, Himâlayan Academy and other institutions, 
for this would involve too close an outer relationship with the ma†havâsis. 
Thus it is that all professional services  for the monasteries are to be pro-
vided by competent people outside the Church membership, and this prin-
ciple applies equally and in all instances to students of Himâlayan Acad-emy. These include medical, legal, business, computer, financial, public 
relations needs and similar categories. 
Ma†havâsis’
UpholdingResponsibility274 ¶The ma†havâsis had been trained in, and in the future 
shall uphold, the edict that they handle all funds and busi-
ness themselves, never relinquishing those key responsibili-
ties to others, however qualified or willing they may be. The monks are 
That splendor that 
resides in an elephant, in a king, among men, or within the waters, with which the Gods in the beginning  came to Godhood, with that same  splendor make me splendid, O Lord.
ATHARV A VEDA 3.22.3. VE, 344About 
UnresolvedDebts 269 ¶The Pî†ham developed a unique way of resolving 
matters when transactions persisted beyond three days 
between family and family or monastery and family. The 
prâyaßchitta  to remove the stress between the two parties was to increase 
the amount owed by one per cent each day the payment was delayed. Sim-
ilarly, there developed a unique prâyaßchitta to compensate the mental 
strain that personal money-lending creates within the fellowship. When 
the Íâstras were not heeded and loans were made and not repaid, when 
the matter came before the Pî†ham, the loan was always considered a gift 
from the lending family to the recipient family. Should remorse later set in 
and the borrowing family wish to repay the debt to resolve the karma, the 
money was always directed into the Hindu Heritage Endowment to benefit 
the Kauai ma†havâsis. This strong penance put a halt to much worldliness 
which could occur as the families became closer and more trusting of 
each other. This penance  is based on similar practices within the Chettiar 
community of South India, who learned to renounce unpaid debts and to 
give to a Lord Murugan Koyil any payment that comes after that renuncia-
tion. Equally important was the giving of credit. The sûtras admonish us 
to effect “cash and carry,“ and no form of credit  was allowed. However, 
there were times when businesses and families gave credit for services 
rendered and goods provided. When such matters came before the Pî†ham, 
the prâyaß chitta always was that if payment was not received within 180 
days, which is six months, the books were wiped clean. Again should pay-
ment occur due to the remorse of the receiver, it was given to the Hindu 
Heritage Endowment to benefit the Kauai ma†havâsis. This alone brought 
much mental freedom and as a result attracted great wealth.

enhanced if the boy has completed his education, established earnings 
through a profession and is at least five years older than the girl. The 
kulapatis and kulamâtâs ponder whether the two families can blend into

the Church in India and Sri Lanka to coordinate travel and trade in these holy lands. In some cases those employed 
were also close ßishyas, members of Íaiva Siddhânta Church, who served 
faithfully and selflessly for many years up until the time of Iraivan’s 
kumbhâbhisheka . After that date, however, the guidelines delineated above 
were applied to these duties as well. Thus, in the future of futures, if liai-

Married Lifepledges are read and avowed to in the presence of select elders prior to 
the wedding. Each of the two families makes a written pledge as well, 
signed by the mother and father of the boy and the mother and father of 
the girl, stating what they promise to do and give toward supporting this 
marriage  in the areas of artha, kâma, dharma and moksha. Also most wel-
come are written testimonies in support of the marriage from grandfathers, 
grandmothers, uncles and aunts, sisters and brothers, as well as from other 
kulapatis and kulamâtâs. This is also a time when anyone among family 
and friends may in deepest confidence, even anonymously, share with the 
Pî†ham any obstacles to this marriage  that should be known and under-
stood by the Guru Mahâsannidhânam. A full, honest disclosure of the boy’s 
life and the girl’s life should be made to both families and to the Pî†ham. 
All four pledges, all written support from relatives and friends and all con-
fidential disclosures are sent to the Aadheenam Pî†ham for blessings. If the pledges and all aspects of the match are auspicious, the Aadheenam sends 
a written approval, with abundant blessings, for the marriage  to take place. 
Only with this blessing may the final engagement occur.
8. EXCHANGE OF GIFTS: When all agreements have been reached, the boy’s 
mother adorns her new daughter with a gold necklace . Generous gifts  are 
exchanged between the individual members of both families to bind the 
two families  together in love and loyalty. It is unacceptable in modern 
Hindu society, and especially in our fellowship, to follow the tradition in 
which the girl becomes the totally adopted daughter of the boy’s family 
and is never again allowed to see her family of birth. The blending of the 
two families as a one family gives both the son and daughter two families to support them in good times and bad. It is the responsibility of both 
families to work toward assuring an endearingly enduring marriage , as 
well as to guide the raising of the progeny, that they may become good, 
productive, dharma -aware citizens, contributing to society at large. If the 
two families fail in this mutual effort, society fails.
9. THE WEDDING: Rejoicing begins with the formal engagement party, 
when the boy and girl exchange gifts, such as engagement rings. Later 
they privately read their pledges to each other in the presence of elders. 
All arrangements and ceremonies culminate on the wedding day, when 
members of both families join to wish the couple a righteous, prosperous, 
happy life leading to the ultimate goal of enlightenment. During weddings  
or other related ceremonies, our vegetarian diet  should in no way be com-

this case, the bride will be under the guidance of the mother-in-law  and 
may spend more time with her than with her husband.
 In marrying the 
son, she becomes the daughter of his mother. 
3. PRESENTING THE PROPOSAL: Once a potential spouse is selected, discreet, 
informal inquiries are made by a relative or friend. If the response is 
encouraging, the girl’s father meets with and presents a proposal  to the 
boy’s father. In some communities it is the boy’s father who presents the 
proposal. In these modern times, with the diaspora throughout the world 
of Hindus from India, Sri Lanka and other countries, the fathers of both 
boy and girl must take an aggressive role in helping their sons and daugh-
ters become well- settled in life. And if fathers do not fulfill this function, 
it becomes the duty of the mothers. This pattern differs from the tradition 
of well-settl ed Indian village communities where only the father of the 
girl makes the overtures. In today’s widely dispersed global Hindu village 
it becomes everyone’s duty to help in the important task of match-making 
for the next generation. 
4. REVIEW OF COMPATIBILITY: The results of the couple’s compatibility test, 
and that of the bride-to-be and her potential mother-in-law, are dispatched 
by the kulapatis to Kauai Aadheenam for review by our jyotisha âchâryas.  
However, compatibilities  are reviewed at the Aadheenam only for matches 
between Church members and only if sent by a kulapati . 
5. BLESSING FROM THE GURU: If both compatibilities are satisfactory, bless-
ings for the marriage are given by the Guru Mahâsannidhânam. If the 
match seems unfavorable, no blessings are given and the families are 
advised to look further. 
6. MEETINGS: Once the match has been tentatively agreed upon, the fami-
lies of the boy and girl gather at the girl’s home to get further acquainted 
and allow the couple to meet and discuss their potential life together.  Of 
course, mutual attraction and full consent of the couple are crucial. 
7. CREATING MARRIAGE COVENANTS : The bride and groom each write out a 
covenant by hand, pledging loyalty to one another and formalizing their 
promises, expectations and love for one another. Before the wedding, the 
couple share these documents with each other, read them carefully and 
make necessary revisions until 100% agreement is achieved. The final

Ongoing 
Support ForEach Marriage282 ¶Once a marriage has been sanctified, both families 
are relied upon to hold the marriage  together through the 
years. As we outlined in sûtra 115, “Each marriage within a 
Íaivite  community enjoys support, strength and encouragement from the 
satguru  and all of Íiva’s followers, and  counsel from elders when needed, 
especially in times of trial. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.” It is the duty especially of the husband’s parents to support and make the marriage work and offer a home to their new daughter. It is the duty of the bride’s parents to moni-
tor her protection and observe the couple’s abilities to dwell in unity and 
concord, while allowing them to work things out together in their new 
home. If she is  abused physically, they must open their doors to receive 
her back to be sheltered, comforted and consoled. It then becomes their 
duty and that of all kulapatis and kulamâtâs in the community to try to 
patch things up, restore harmony and obtain trustworthy promises from 
the husband that this will never happen again. The bride should receive 
no blame for her husband’s violence, for it is he who has broken his prom-
ise to adore and protect her from harm. The husband shall be given severe 
penance from the Pî†ham. When his atonement is satisfactory to all, the 
girl may return to him. If he does not perform his penance, his dismissal 
from the Church is automatic. The wife, however, may remain a member.
Woman’s 
Control ofPrâ∫a283 ¶A woman’s first obligation is to give her prâ∫a,  spiri-
tual energy, to her husband and make him strong. Children 
give their prâ∫a to their parents, because the parents are 
Íiva-Íakti, the first guru,  to them. The wife , always attending to her hus-
band’s needs, sets the pattern for the children. They will naturally then be loyal and obedient to their parents, bringing them joy now and in later 
years. Parents who set good examples instill kindly patterns within their 
children. When the woman fulfills her strî dharma  properly and gives her 
prâ∫a, love and attention fully to her husband, he is inspired to give back 
to her ten-fold, and all flourish. By focusing her energies within her family, 
a great spiritual vibration is built up in the home. This means she is careful and conservative with her prâ∫as. For example, she stays in the home most 
of the time. As a rule, she  never goes out alone, but always with a compan-

months should be allowed for the jyotisha âchâryas  and

arranging a proper match for a son or daughter often takes two or more 
years. There should never be a sense of urgency for this or any other life-

or girl. They remain free to cancel the process at any time if the match does not seem suitable to them. As Sage Y ogaswâmî so wisel y said, “No

acquire the compatibility, or if advice given is not taken, we will consider 
that a karmic match has already been completed, and no further interven-

blessings are not given and the marriage occurs anyway, extra support is 
encouraged from the kulapatis and kulamâtâs to harmonize the prâ∫as

Marrying
OutsideThe Church280 ¶A boy or girl who marries outside the membership 
of the Church may continue as a Church member with the

one who is interested in our Íaivite teachings and then encourage the 
spouse to enroll as a student and become a member.

Cross-NationalMarriages  281 ¶In 1994 I issued the following statement to heads of 
families worldwide on cross-national marriages: “Our 
Íaiva Siddhânta Church is now the sum total of all the 
many extended families worldwide relating and interrelating through reli-
gious activities, friendships, business and cross-national marriages. Cross-
national marriages are inevitable as the peoples of the world become more and more a global village. This is the real, earthy expression of our 
belief in one God and one world. The soul has nothing to do with national-
ism, social restrictions, ethnic taboos or restrictive, prejudicial upbringing. 
Two souls joining in dharmic matrimony transcend all such boundaries. It 
is the couple’s shared allegiance to the Pî†ham that is the most important 
common ground.  As the spiritual preceptor of many joint and extended 
families, we expect the heads of each family to pay close attention to the 
above and speak against racial and ethnic prejudice and cross-national discrimination. Allow your own actions, your belief, your commitment, 
your determination to awaken the ancient teachings in your life and the

Ongoing 
Support ForEach Marriage282 ¶Once a marriage has been sanctified, both families 
are relied upon to hold the marriage  together through the 
years. As we outlined in sûtra 115, “Each marriage within a 
Íaivite  community enjoys support, strength and encouragement from the 
satguru  and all of Íiva’s followers, and  counsel from elders when needed, 
especially in times of trial. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.” It is the duty especially of the husband’s parents to support and make the marriage work and offer a home to their new daughter. It is the duty of the bride’s parents to moni-
tor her protection and observe the couple’s abilities to dwell in unity and 
concord, while allowing them to work things out together in their new 
home. If she is  abused physically, they must open their doors to receive 
her back to be sheltered, comforted and consoled. It then becomes their 
duty and that of all kulapatis and kulamâtâs in the community to try to 
patch things up, restore harmony and obtain trustworthy promises from 
the husband that this will never happen again. The bride should receive 
no blame for her husband’s violence, for it is he who has broken his prom-
ise to adore and protect her from harm. The husband shall be given severe 
penance from the Pî†ham. When his atonement is satisfactory to all, the 
girl may return to him. If he does not perform his penance, his dismissal 
from the Church is automatic. The wife, however, may remain a member.
Woman’s 
Control ofPrâ∫a283 ¶A woman’s first obligation is to give her prâ∫a,  spiri-
tual energy, to her husband and make him strong. Children 
give their prâ∫a to their parents, because the parents are 
Íiva-Íakti, the first guru,  to them. The wife , always attending to her hus-
band’s needs, sets the pattern for the children. They will naturally then be loyal and obedient to their parents, bringing them joy now and in later 
years. Parents who set good examples instill kindly patterns within their 
children. When the woman fulfills her strî dharma  properly and gives her 
prâ∫a, love and attention fully to her husband, he is inspired to give back 
to her ten-fold, and all flourish. By focusing her energies within her family, 
a great spiritual vibration is built up in the home. This means she is careful and conservative with her prâ∫as. For example, she stays in the home most 
of the time. As a rule, she  never goes out alone, but always with a compan-
ion, generally her husband, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, mother, daughter, 
sister or another lady close to the family, or among a group of both men 
and women. She is a paradigm of modesty : wearing longer-sleeved blous-
es, sârîs that conceal the navel, covering her head when approaching the

Regulating
Sex DuringMarriage287 ¶“T o what extent can celibacy  be practiced during 
married life?” is a question that is sometimes asked. My 
general response is that one should not think of celibacy 
once the vivâha saμskâra  has been performed. But regulation of the sexual 
energies  between the couple is advisable, along with regular daily sâ dha-
na, prâ∫âyâma, ha†ha yoga,  rising before sunrise, exercise and vegetarian 
diet. Regulate these bodily functions to once a week, once a month, or in 
the extreme—as the brâhmin community is traditionally admonished—
having sexual intercourse only when trying to conceive a child and then 
only at proper times of the year on auspicious days and at auspicious times. 
The brâhmins, being masters of astrology, jyotisha, could understand the 
depth of these commitments, and their performing pûjâ within the temple 
daily used up or transmuted the sacred energies. Outside the traditional 
priesthood, regulation of the use of these energies be tween husband and 
wife should be considered valuable to health, productivity, creativity and 
a better life. T o allow these sacred energies to run wild can cause the 
lower nature to come forward—giving rise to anger, jealousy, revenge, 
seeking for the last word in arguments, beatings with harsh words 
and even physical abuse, such as pinching, slaps, punching or cuffings. 
Celibacy in
Latter YearsOf Marriage288 ¶Couples should eventually observe total celibacy, but 
this is usually begun at 60 years of age or older, with the 
remarriage abhisheka and vows of celibacy. After this point 
they employ their time and sacred energies in religious worship, yoga, 
dhâra∫â, dhyâna, seeking for jñâna and their eventual moksha. Thus, 
married couples who have raised their family take the celibacy vow  by 
mutual consent in the vâ∫aprastha or sannyâsa âßramas , as reflected in 
sûtra 120: “Íiva’s followers who have raised their family may, by mutual

energies is strictly avoided. Men heed the same wisdom, as explained in 
sûtra 81. The wife is to her husband as a minister to a king, a mother to a 
child, a friend to a friend. It is her duty to make him strong. 
The Balance
Of Prâ∫as inThe Home284 ¶In fulfilling his purusha dharma , the husband gives 
his prâ∫a, love and loyalty to his family and to the com-
munity through his service. He never, ever raises his voice 
in the home, nor does he show anger in any way. His is the model for the 
entire family. What he does, how he behaves and what he says is his legacy of fulfillment of purusha dharma , and the entire 365 Nandinâtha Sûtras. 
For if he does not fulfill them all, who then will? By his words and actions 
he gives permission for every member of the family to do likewise, now or 
in the future. When his sons come of age, they join their prâ∫as with his, 
and as a result the family, the community and the country flourish. So it 
is that the perfect pattern continues to grow and grow and grow, guided 
by the wise male elders. 
Family Demise
From WomenLeaving Home285 ¶Fifty or sixty years ago families were stable because 
the man was the head of the family and the wife  stayed 
home and raised the children. She helped support the 
family by being frugal, and by gardening, sewing, and making sure the 
children had chores to do as well. After the first and second world wars, 
the women went to work outside the home. They became their husband’s 
partners rather than wives, society  broke down and women  took over as 
head of the family. Our extended-family system has effected social change 
to begin reversing this trend through educational programs and, most 
importantly, living examples. 
Protocols to

life that sustains the harmonious balance of force within 
the home. Each home shrine is like a temple, clean and 
beautiful. Each wife serves her husband faithfully, arising before him 
each morning to ready the shrine and prepare his morning beverage. At 
mealtimes, she observes the tradition of serving her husband and family 
first. As said in sûtra 85, “Íiva’s men devotees, on arriving  home from  work, 
im mediately  bathe and enter their  shrine for the blessings of  Gods and 
 guru  to dispel  worldly forces and re gain the state of  Íiva consciousness.

A Remedy
For TroubledYouths291 ¶Y outh who do not demonstrate the qualities of obedi-
ence, cooperation, respect and desire for learning in this 
âßrama are encouraged during their summers to work on 
farms, grow food and earn their pu∫ya by feeding family and society until 
they adjust to the cycles of life  through being close to nature and quietly 
disciplined by nature. They can also work afternoons alongside an expe-
rienced local farmer,  watching and learning the cycles of life, how things 
grow. After this adjustment is complete, they may enter the brahmachârî 
âßrama  fully and begin to seek for intellectual advancement with a new-
found maturity. Nature will discipline the instinctive nature, and automat-
ically the intellectual nature begins to unfold. If they are taught dharma 
and a few classical yoga techniques, like ha†ha yoga and simple medita-
tion, the spiritual nature will gradually arise, and they will become use-
ful, productive members of society. This principle is in keeping with Sage 
Y ogaswâmî’s wise instructions to the young seekers of Sri Lanka. He sent 
them to Batticaloa, there to serve simply in natural surroundings at his 
small rural âßrama, to think of God while working in the paddy fields, 
learning to be summa, perfectly quiet and content within themselves. 
G®ihastha,
Householder,Age 24-48292 ¶The second stage, the g®ihastha âßrama , extends from 
age 24 to 48. In Hindu tradition it is the duty of husband and 
wife during their householder years to bear and raise chil-
dren and to bequeath their property to them. It is their duty to support not only their own family, but the other three âßramas as well. When youthful 
themselves, they were supported and cared for. When they enter the last two âßramas they will again have no means of support and will rely on 
the support of those in the g®ihastha âßrama. Therefore, during this time of 
economic productivity, the family repays what they received from society as children and what they will enjoy in life’s latter stages.

in cloistered noncoed âßramas, during which time they release each other 
from the sûtra responsibility of communicating daily . Celibacy at this lat-

sacred energies into higher forms of expression that burns the last remain-
ing seeds of prârabdha karmas  (and even other karmas lying in wait to 
manifest in the next life) through the awakening of the ku∫∂alinî ßakti.
Life’s Four
Stages ofDevelopment289 ¶By its recognition of the four âßramas , or stages of 
life, our religion bestows a unique and effective instru-
ment for spiritual progress. These stages are the manifesta-
tion of natural law as each soul lives through each incarnation: first as 
brahmachârî, in a period of study and learning; then as g®ihastha into 
active involvement as a productive, responsible member of society; then as 
vâ∫aprastha, with the duties of senior counselor and advisor; and finally 
as a renunciate in the sannyâsa âßrama,  the stage of withdrawal from soci-
ety to contemplation of God. Each stage should bring increasing perfection 
in personal discipline in fulfillment of all 365 Nandinâtha Sûtras. My satg-
uru, Sage Y ogaswâmî, proclaimed, “By remaining in the ma†hams of brah-
macharya, g®ihastha, vâ∫aprastha and sannyâsa, we can complete the pil-
grimage.” The Dravidian Íâstras give in verse 491 a unique overview of the 
states the soul undergoes through an incarnation. “When a soul is in a six-
year-old physical body, he is in divine consciousness and in tune with the 
three worlds. At this time the height of Divinity is manifest through him. 
He only comes again into this state after the age of 54 which continues to 
the physical age of 72 and then again enters this stage after the age of 84 
which continues on through the rest of his physical existence. From the 
age of 72 to the age of 84, he is able to strongly express spiritual intellect.”
Brahmacharya,
Studentship,Age 12-24290 ¶The first stage of life, brahmacharya âßrama , or stu-
dentship stage, corresponds roughly to ages 12 through 24, 
based on a foundation of training in culture and religion 
from the time of birth. It is the time for the acquisition of skills and knowl-
edge that will serve in later life. It is a time to learn respect and obedience 
to teacher and family, loyalty to family and friends, service to humanity, 
proper manners, good habits, philosophy and culture. It is a time to learn

vâ∫aprastha, with the duties of senior counselor and advisor; and finally 
as a renunciate in the sannyâsa âßrama,  the stage of withdrawal from soci-
ety to contemplation of God. Each stage should bring increasing perfection 
in personal discipline in fulfillment of all 365 Nandinâtha Sûtras. My satg-
uru, Sage Y ogaswâmî, proclaimed, “By remaining in the ma†hams of brah-
macharya, g®ihastha, vâ∫aprastha and sannyâsa, we can complete the pil-
grimage.” The Dravidian Íâstras give in verse 491 a unique overview of the 
states the soul undergoes through an incarnation. “When a soul is in a six-
year-old physical body, he is in divine consciousness and in tune with the 
three worlds. At this time the height of Divinity is manifest through him. 
He only comes again into this state after the age of 54 which continues to 
the physical age of 72 and then again enters this stage after the age of 84 
which continues on through the rest of his physical existence. From the 
age of 72 to the age of 84, he is able to strongly express spiritual intellect.”
Brahmacharya,
Studentship,Age 12-24290 ¶The first stage of life, brahmacharya âßrama , or stu-
dentship stage, corresponds roughly to ages 12 through 24, 
based on a foundation of training in culture and religion 
from the time of birth. It is the time for the acquisition of skills and knowl-
edge that will serve in later life. It is a time to learn respect and obedience 
to teacher and family, loyalty to family and friends, service to humanity, 
proper manners, good habits, philosophy and culture. It is a time to learn

1.  S¨TRA 211, JUDICIOUS TRAINING OF CHILDREN
My followers consider the raising of children a sacred responsibility. 
Based on astrology, tradition and wise counsel, they shall formulate pat-

2. S¨TRA 212, BESTOWING THE ESSENTIAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS
My followers who are parents should creatively train their boys in techni-

plishments of music, art, sewing, cooking and home management. Aum.
3. S¨TRA 213, AGAINST CHILD ABUSE
My followers shall never ever govern their offspring through fear. They 
are forbidden to spank, slap or hit their children, use harsh or angry 
words, neglect or abuse them in any way. Cursed are they who do. Aum.
4. S¨TRA 214, ON GOVERNING WITH KINDNESS
My followers love their offspring, govern them with kindness and set an 
example in the five parenting guidelines: good conduct, home worship, reli-
gious discussion, continuous self-study and following a preceptor. Aum.

Chapter 16stage is called vâ∫aprastha , literally, “forest dweller.” Traditionally, it is a 
period of retirement from the arena of serving family and self, a time of 
entering into civic or national service in a selfless spirit. The vâ∫aprasthin 
has completed the life of personal desire and has retired from profes-
sional life to service on a broader level, and to more temple worship and 
ex tended sâdhana. Simplicity, study, meditation and goodwill toward all 
are his hallmarks. This âßrama is a contemplative, political, advisory, ser-
vice-oriented time of passing on one’s skills and knowledge to better the 
community. Through his inner resources the advisor, counselor or public 
servant is guided from the inner worlds and his own superconscious being. 
Sannyâsa, 
Solitaire,Age 72 Onward294 ¶The fourth stage, sannyâsa âßrama , is the culmina-
tion of the three previous periods of life. Religion has per-
meated each earlier stage, but now it becomes the central 
theme, life’s single purpose. As the physical forces wane, there is a natu-
ral drawing away from concerns of the world and a compelling turning 
toward deepening religious practices: scriptural study, worship, austerities, 
pilgrimage, meditation and the other disciplines of yoga. Upon reaching 
the sannyâsa âßrama,  it is advisable to take the brahmacharya vrata  if the 
vow was not taken at an earlier time.  This period is a natural awakening, 
expression, maturing and withdrawal by family men from involvement 
in the world. Entry into this stage of life after age 72 is sometimes ritually 
acknowledged through the sannyâsârambha saμskâra, but is never con-
fused with sannyâsa dîkshâ, the Íaiva swâmî’s formal initiation and holy 
orders of renunciate life. The extent of withdrawal in the Nandinâtha Sam-
pradâya is purely an individual matter, ranging from the retired couple 
who continue to live within the community as celibate couple, to total world-renunciation for the widowed, divorced or unmarried brahmachârî. 
Sûtra 210 indicates my edict for the latter extreme: “Íiva’s unmarried men 
and widowers may  renounce the  world after age 72, severing all ties with 
their community and living as unordained, self-declared  sannyâsins

purifying sâdhana  I have given to others in this situation. I 
know that it really works from my own experience, having 
given this ßâstric prâyaßchitta  to beginning monks who had for various 
reasons upset the nerve system of the entire monastery. The important remedy for belligerence is that youthful, out-of-control energies and self-
centeredness must be turned toward nature, to the local farm, the family 
vegetable garden or even the potted plants in the home, not to areas of 
life where they will learn to be even more destructive than they already 
are. The remedy is that they should be directed to spend their weekends, off-hours and school vacations working on farms, growing food  and other 
plants and experiencing the cycles of nature, working alongside an expe-rienced farmer, agriculturalist or nurseryman who can teach them the 
ways of nature he has learned.

solution for all concerned than the alternative which includes the courts, 
the juvenile social workers, the drug-addicted streets, the low-minded 
half-way houses and the ultimate correction, prison. Y ogaswâmî held this 
same vision. He often sent young men to work in the paddy fields in Bat-
ticaloa to imbibe the earthy arts, to be one with nature, to grow food. 
Being disciplined by nature is much better than being disciplined by the police. Nature will teach them patience, tenderness, earthy pragmatism 
and the value of proper timing and working in harmony with others. 
With these qualities awakened within them, they should become good, 
useful citizens and have wisdom to pass on to their own progeny. The 
Tirukural reminds us in verse 1031, “Wherever it may wander, the world 
must follow the farmer. Thus despite all its hardships, farming is the most

Guarding
Against AlienInfluences 298 ¶My ßishyas should not send their children to Chris-
tian missionary schools , nor to schools  founded in the name 
of any other religion who seek to influence them, even in 
subtle ways, such as through symbols and peer missionaries who chide 
Hindu children about their culture, their beliefs, their dress or their sym-
bols. These schools have a detrimental effect on the subconscious minds 
of the children by steadily turning them away from Hindu beliefs. When 
they slowly absorb the attitudes of another faith, slowly their belief struc-ture is altered, and gradually their actions at home reflect this change. 
The child who once attended home pûjâ with joy and respected the visit-
ing swâmî no longer shows him pra∫âmas, resists pûjâ time, challenges 
parental decisions and slowly takes over the home, relegating the par-
ents to second-class citizenship within it. All in the home are consigned 
to dance around the contrary feelings of such children  in order to avoid 
their threats of unchaperoned dating, leaving home, even suicide. This is 
a situation millions of families, including Hindu families, in today’s world 
understand only too well. Children learn more techniques from the dys-
functional families and their incorrigible bastard generation depicted on 
TV  through the efforts of Bollywood and Hollywood.

being cooperative souls seeking training to become responsible members 
of society. In their state of uncontrolled instinctiveness, which they take advantage of, holding no respect for their parents, they are capable of destroying the home, embarrassing their parents in front of other adults 
by their adharmic actions and setting atrocious examples for younger chil-
dren around them. How to deal with such a situation, which should not

Adopting
A NewProfession306 ¶Family closeness is jeopardized when a profession 
is chosen that differs from the family profession . However, 
occasionally bright children are selected to branch out into 
other vocations. For this enterprise to succeed and not to fail, the entire 
family, elders and key relatives, must be dedicated to its success. The chil-
dren of a son who succeeds would begin a new line of profession or occu-
pation within the extended family. It is risky, and failure often occurs due 
to lack of communication, sympathy and support, resulting in the youth’s 
running away from the entire family situation, to begin his own nuclear 
home. Therefore, great care must be taken in judging which youths would be eligible to adopt a new vocation. This is why backing a child who 
chooses his own profession  against the advice of his parents and elders is 
not encouraged. Little or no money is spent on children who bring pain to 
their parents. Therefore, asking a child “What are you going to be when 
you grow up?” might well be costly and bring much misery in the latter years of both parents. 
Determining
The BestPattern307 ¶Whether or not to enter a profession  different from 
that of the family is a decision that is best made by study-
ing out the talents of the youth, his character, responsive-
ness and natural abilities, not by responding to superficial whims and 
fancies. Here jyotisha  can be an immense help, and the Pî†ham is prepared 
to assist. Wisdom dictates that the brightest, most loyal and loving chil-
dren be chosen to begin new strands of occupation and then be backed 
up fully so that run-away situations do not occur, which could be costly 
financially and emotionally for all concerned. The objective in choosing 
a child to go into a new vocation is to uplift the entire local community 
within his native land , not to serve outside it, squandering his money and 
intelligence there and ignoring his own community  and family ties  and 
needs. T o control the situation, to bring success, it is important that the 
kulaguru work closely with the youth and his parents, giving good advice 
along the way to protect him from the temptation of accepting positions outside his country’s and his family’s purview.
The Erosive
Spirit ofCompetition 308 ¶Sûtra 12 explains, “Those who live with Íiva endeav-
or to be their best in whatever they do, to  excel and make 
a difference. Even so, they remain apart from the demean-
ing and conten tious “winners and losers” spirit of  competition. Aum.” T o 
Ahiμsâ is not caus-
ing pain to any living being at any time through the actions of one’s mind, speech or body.
ATHARV A VEDA,
SANDILY AU 1.3. UPA, 173Not Attending
Schools  of 
Other Faiths303 ¶Sûtra  238 affirms: “Íiva’s devotees never educate 
their  children in  institutions that would instill or force on 
them the teachings of alien  religions. They know that the 
early impres sions of  youth go deep and can never be totally erased. Aum.” 
True, they may never convert to another religion, but they also may not 
be able to live as devout, supportive Hindus. Instead, as adults, they may become detractors and naysayers, saying no to positive ideas, dragging 
their feet when opportunities arise to serve, secretly opposing all efforts to advance the Hindu faith, even seeking its demise by back-biting, untrue 
storytelling and breeding distrust for  swâmîs, pa∫∂itas,  astrologers and 
other Hindu religious leaders. As one Catholic Father  confided, “The Hindu 
children in our school may never become Catholics, but they also will 
never be good Hindus.” 
Teaching  in
HinduSchools304 ¶T eachers who are Church members are strongly 
encouraged to give their energies and talents to Hindu 
schools and refrain from teaching in the schools of other 
re ligions. Their belief structure can be and often is eroded by mixing 
closely with people of other religions in the school environment. They are 
in wardly pressured to assume non-Hindu attitudes and over time they 
make them their own. Far too often their former Hindu bhakti turns to mere 
philosophy and then philosophy turns to cynicism. Philosophy without 
bhakti is likened to a path paved with words. Hindu teachers are encour-
aged to teach in public or government schools, but preferably Hindu schools, 
for their own peace of mind in the fulfillment of their personal dharma. 
Following 
The Family Profession 305 ¶A variety of essential skills, outlined in the 64 kalâs, 
should be learned by the age of 19. By this time parents and 
elders have observed the natural inclinations of the youth, 
and his or her future education can be planned out in some detail, ideally 
within the family’s profession or business. In the Antarloka, souls choose 
their parents according to their karmas waiting to be expressed when a 
new physical body is obtained. Therefore, a person is born into a family 
to fulfill the profession of that family or to upgrade the ethnic community 
of their race by advancing into a new profession or area of work with full and heartfelt family support. In continuing in the family profession, the 
son or daughter maintains communication and closeness with both father 
and mother. Going into the family profession  or business, the child absorbs 
needed skills from a young age and even prenatally. As sûtra 146 explains: 
“Íiva’s followers abide by the tradition of bringing sons and daughters into

ness and natural abilities, not by responding to superficial whims and 
fancies. Here jyotisha  can be an immense help, and the Pî†ham is prepared 
to assist. Wisdom dictates that the brightest, most loyal and loving chil-
dren be chosen to begin new strands of occupation and then be backed 
up fully so that run-away situations do not occur, which could be costly 
financially and emotionally for all concerned. The objective in choosing 
a child to go into a new vocation is to uplift the entire local community 
within his native land , not to serve outside it, squandering his money and 
intelligence there and ignoring his own community  and family ties  and 
needs. T o control the situation, to bring success, it is important that the 
kulaguru work closely with the youth and his parents, giving good advice 
along the way to protect him from the temptation of accepting positions outside his country’s and his family’s purview.
The Erosive
Spirit ofCompetition 308 ¶Sûtra 12 explains, “Those who live with Íiva endeav-
or to be their best in whatever they do, to  excel and make 
a difference. Even so, they remain apart from the demean-
ing and conten tious “winners and losers” spirit of  competition. Aum.” T o 
Ahiμsâ is not caus-
ing pain to any living being at any time through the actions of one’s mind, speech or body.
ATHARV A VEDA,
SANDILY AU 1.3. UPA, 173Not Attending
Schools  of 
Other Faiths303 ¶Sûtra  238 affirms: “Íiva’s devotees never educate 
their  children in  institutions that would instill or force on 
them the teachings of alien  religions. They know that the 
early impres sions of  youth go deep and can never be totally erased. Aum.” 
True, they may never convert to another religion, but they also may not 
be able to live as devout, supportive Hindus. Instead, as adults, they may become detractors and naysayers, saying no to positive ideas, dragging 
their feet when opportunities arise to serve, secretly opposing all efforts to advance the Hindu faith, even seeking its demise by back-biting, untrue 
storytelling and breeding distrust for  swâmîs, pa∫∂itas,  astrologers and 
other Hindu religious leaders. As one Catholic Father  confided, “The Hindu 
children in our school may never become Catholics, but they also will 
never be good Hindus.” 
Teaching  in
HinduSchools304 ¶T eachers who are Church members are strongly 
encouraged to give their energies and talents to Hindu 
schools and refrain from teaching in the schools of other 
re ligions. Their belief structure can be and often is eroded by mixing 
closely with people of other religions in the school environment. They are 
in wardly pressured to assume non-Hindu attitudes and over time they 
make them their own. Far too often their former Hindu bhakti turns to mere 
philosophy and then philosophy turns to cynicism. Philosophy without 
bhakti is likened to a path paved with words. Hindu teachers are encour-
aged to teach in public or government schools, but preferably Hindu schools, 
for their own peace of mind in the fulfillment of their personal dharma. 
Following 
The Family Profession 305 ¶A variety of essential skills, outlined in the 64 kalâs, 
should be learned by the age of 19. By this time parents and 
elders have observed the natural inclinations of the youth, 
and his or her future education can be planned out in some detail, ideally 
within the family’s profession or business. In the Antarloka, souls choose 
their parents according to their karmas waiting to be expressed when a 
new physical body is obtained. Therefore, a person is born into a family 
to fulfill the profession of that family or to upgrade the ethnic community 
of their race by advancing into a new profession or area of work with full and heartfelt family support. In continuing in the family profession, the 
son or daughter maintains communication and closeness with both father 
and mother. Going into the family profession  or business, the child absorbs 
needed skills from a young age and even prenatally. As sûtra 146 explains: 
“Íiva’s followers abide by the tradition of bringing sons and daughters into

is good for one and what is not is what is remembered the next day. Since 
television is for relaxation and education, we do not want to carry memo-

avoid. T o watch television for recreation and to keep informed about the 
world’s contemporary ways is important. T o limit this watching to two 
hours a day is a great wisdom for the entire family—also for individuals living alone.”
Family and
PersonalRetreats 311 ¶Sûtra 229 states: “Íiva’s devotees observe a thirty-one-
day  retreat after the  birth or  death of a  family member, not 
entering  temples or home  shrines, not attending  pûjâ  or 
religious events, but continuing their japa,  study and meditations. Aum.” 
When someone is born or dies, a door to either the higher or lower inner 
worlds is opened for all who share a psychic bond, depending on where 
the soul has come from or has gone. A psychic passageway of vulnerability 
persists for 31 days, which is particularly magnetic in instances of death. 
The home shrine is closed, white cloth placed over the Deities, and spiri-
tual practices curtailed to avoid the pitfalls that could result in inadver-tently drawing forth the energies of beings of the lower worlds rather than the higher. Japa, scriptural reading and devotional singing are the only 
forms of sâdhana  performed during the retreat . Social activities, including 
visiting with other families, continue according to tradition, but all deep-
er sâdha nas, such as meditation, pûjâ  and pilgrimage, are discontinued . 
For a birth, the retreat pertains only to those living in the household of the 
baby. For a death, the retreat is taken even by relatives living outside the home, all who are psychically connected to the deceased. The judgment of 
who is part of the family rests on the shoulders of the family itself. 
Blessing to
Reopen theHome Shrine 312 ¶After the 31-day retreat for birth or death in the fam-
ily, a special ceremony  is arranged by the preshana chakra-
vâla to reopen the shrine room, bless the house and close 
those particular doors opened by the birth or death, through rituals per-
formed by a professional priest. The ma†havâsis do not perform this par-
ticular priestly service. This reopening of the shrine is a happy time of 
sharing among mission members. 
He who, dwelling in 
all things, yet is other than all things, whom all things do not know, whose body all things are, who controls all things from within—He is your soul, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.

to the spirit of ahiμsâ . Ahiμsâ advocates team playership, of all on the 
same side. It awakens the “win-win” spirit. Hiμsâ keeps alive the “win-
lose” spirit. Those seekers who participate in or watch competitive sports 
are the first ones to be argumentative and disagreeable, always ready to 
take the opposite side. Y es, competition  keeps the instinctive, intellectual 
forces alive in seekers and clouds the spiritual force. It is not the truth 
they seek, but the enemy. Those who are so clouded buy toy guns and 
knives for their children and encourage them to take sides. Competitive 
sports are the foundation for conflict, even war. That is why I proclaim to 
followers: discourage this way of life early on. 
Listening
To Hindu Music 309 ¶Sûtra 73 pronounces my guidance on music and song : 
“Íiva’s devotees, in their homes, endeavor to surround them-
selves with  Íaiva  images,  music and  song. In the world they 
may enjoy the  arts of other cultures but strictly avoid lower-world artistic 
expressions. Aum.” By way of explanation for our catalysts, I have writ-
ten the following bhâshya. “ This sûtra is one of the most controversial 
and seemingly hard for new seekers of truth to understand, especially 
if they are highly influenced by Western thought and habit. Those will-ing to comply quickly are indeed true truth seekers and worthy of some 
attention. Those who have difficulty should be helped to acquire beautiful 
music played on traditional instruments by Íaiva souls.”

avoid  nudi ty,  foul language, crudeness and excessive  violence. Aum.” On 
this daily guideline for the world of TV  I have composed for our Academy

Personal Liferequires a clean and well-ordered environment, yogic purging of the inter-
nal organs and frequent cleansing with water. Mental purity derives from meditation, right living and right thinking. Emotional purity depends on 
control of the mind, clearing the subconscious and keeping good com-
pany. Spiritual purity is achieved by following the yamas and niyamas, 
studying the Veda s and other scriptures, pilgrimage, meditation, jâpa, 
tapas  and ahiμsâ. Ritual purity requires the observance of certain prây-
aßchittas, or penances, for defilement derived from foreign travel, contact 
with base people or places, conversion to other faiths, contact with bodily wastes, attending a funeral, etc. Purity  is of three forms—purity in mind, 
speech and body, or thought, word and deed. Purity is the pristine and 
natural state of the soul. Impurity, or pollution, is the obscuring of this 
state by adulterating experience and beclouding conceptions. In daily life, 
the Hindu strives to protect this innate purity by wise living, following the 
codes of dharma. This includes harnessing the sexual energies, associating 
with other virtuous Hindu devotees, never using harsh, angered or indecent 
language, and keeping a clean and healthy physical body. 
The Primary
Importance of Sexual Purity 316 ¶It is well known that harnessing the sexual forces is 
essential to progress on the spiritual path. As the introduc-
tion of our Book of Virtue explains, “Energy in one sacred 
stream is powerful. The results of its usage are easily seen, and its source 
readily found. Energy dispersed in a multiplicity of ways is neither strong 
nor too effective in any of them. Virtue harnesses and keeps the one life 
force within man in a single stream through which he is able to fulfill 
a spiritual destiny on this planet.” This code is embedded in sûtra 71: 
“Devout Hindus observe the eightfold  celibacy toward everyone but their 
spouse, renouncing  sexual  fantasy, glorification,  flirtation, lustful glances, 
secret love talk, amorous longing, rendezvous and intercourse. Aum.”
Purity in a
PromiscuousEra317 ¶ In today’s world this sûtra might seem to be going 
against an ever-growing trend. Sexual fantasy, glorification, 
flirtation, lustful glances, secret love talk, amorous longing, 
rendezvous and intercourse are the entertainment of most peoples on the planet. Maybe it has always been like this in the adult world, but now it 
is in the world of the youth and the very young as well, widely broad-
cast and promoted on TV  and the Internet  as the most glamorous of all 
activities. This is a big change. Right from the start, we must inform seek-ers who come to us through the Nandinâtha Tantras, Dancing with Íiva 
or Living with Íiva that we are all dedicated to old-fashioned ways and 
This soul, verily, is

Retreat forWomen 313 ¶Another form of retreat  is described in sûtra 93: 
“Íiva’s women devotees, by custom, rest and regenerate 
physical forces during  menses, re frain ing from heavy or 
demanding  work. On these days they do not  enter temples or home  shrines, 
or approach  holy men. Aum.”  Íishyas have asked whether study and 
sâ dhana should be performed during this monthly retreat. The answer 
is yes. There is no reason that women cannot study the lessons of The 
Master Course  during their monthly period. It is completely traditional, 
acceptable and, in fact, ideal for women to do their devotions in their own 
room or any clean place at this time, without interruption. Such devotions 
would include prayers, sâdhana, meditation, religious study, ha†ha yoga,  
devotional singing,  japa yoga,  etc. It is traditional for women during their 
monthly period to refrain from attending or performing pûjâ,  entering the 
home shrine or temple or approaching swâmîs or other holy men. Also 
during this time women do not help in pûjâ  preparation, such as picking 
flowers or making prasâda for the Deity. At this time of retreat, ladies are 
allowed to rest and perform private sâdhanas , such as ha†ha yoga, japa, 
prâ∫âyâma, meditation and reading the holy texts.
Retreats
For PhysicalInjuries 314 ¶This same rule applies to men or women with 
in juries that are in the process of healing. However, it does 
not apply to minor scratches. Cuts, injuries, internal bleed-
ing and operations create psychic openings in the aura that allow vulner-
ability for lower-astral Naraka people to enter or to draw energy from and do damage with that energy. The period of retreat extends until the bleed-
ing stops and there is no more danger of infection. A minor cut or scratch 
may reach this point within a few hours. A deeper cut will generally take 
two or three days to knit to the point that no restriction is required. A 
severe wound may take ten days or longer. A major operation, such as heart surgery, caesarean section or appendicitis, might require several weeks or 
even longer, until the person feels whole again. This means that you do 
not go to a Hindu temple to get healed from injuries such as these, though 
loved ones can go to pray on your behalf. 
Purity’s 
CentralityIn Hinduism315 ¶Purity and its opposite, pollution, are a fundamen-
tal part of Hindu culture. While they imply a strong sense 
of physical cleanliness, their more important meanings 
extend to social, ceremonial, mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual con-
tamination. Freedom from all forms of contamination is a key to Hindu 
spirituality, and is one of the yamas, known as saucha. Physical purity

Ancient 
Insights onPuberty319 ¶V erse 490 of the Dravidian Íâstras describes the 
dawn of puberty  and the need for careful direction of 
instinctive drives: “Puberty begins when the awareness of 
the soul comes into the animal nerve system as a result of being in this 
particular kind of fleshy body. Before this time the body is maturing and 
growing, and the nerve system of the soul’s inner body governs it, much 
like it did when we had our original fibrous bodies. But when four cycles have passed, the external structure becomes firmed and strong and the 
instincts for mating occur. Therefore, it is important that these forces be 
carefully directed so that the soul is not clouded by instinctive drives and 
still maintains its inner contact with the three worlds.” 
Wisdom
RegardingPornography320 ¶Excessive violence and pornography  are two evils 
that can but should not creep into a household through 
games, TV , pictures shared by friends within the home. A 
watchful eye must be kept so this does not happen and affect the fami-
ly’s mental health. My edict on pornography is given in sûtra 59: “Íiva’s 
devotees are forbidden to speak of, listen to or look at exhibitions of  por-
nography. This adharma  is addictive, erodes self-esteem and teaches that 
degrading women, men and children is acceptable behavior. Aum.”
Celibacy
And AdultSingle Life321 ¶As explained in sûtra 107 , “Íiva’s unmarried  adoles-
cent and adult devotees are all considered  brahmachârîs or 
brahmachâri∫îs, bound to  the wise restraints of chastity 
that tradition prescribes, whether they have taken a celibacy  vow or not. 
Aum.” Adults who live the single life of the brahmachârî or brahmachâri∫î  
outside our monasteries are under the guidance of kulapati and kulamâtâ  
as a member of their spiritual family. Celibacy is also strictly upheld by 
widows and widowers  who elect not to  remarry, as stated in sûtra 102: 
“Íiva’s widowed devotees who choose not to remarry practice strict conti-
nence. They dedicate their lives  to God and  transmute  sexual forces into 
the higher  chakras through sâdhana,  worship and  brahmacharya . Aum.”
Íâstric 
Wisdom onCleanliness322 ¶It is well known that one’s environment has a pro-
found impact on his or her mental, emotional and spiritual 
being. We have affirmed this principle in sûtra 209: “Lovers 
of Íiva keep their  home and work  environment  clean and uncluttered to 
maintain a spiritual vibra tion and not attract negative forces. They seek 
fresh air and sunshine and surround themselves with beauty. Aum.” Our 
Íaivite Íâstras,  verse 49, set for the monasteries a pattern that all should 
How can he practice 
true compassion who eats the flesh of an ani-mal to fatten his own flesh? Greater than a thousand ghee offer-
ings consumed in sacrificial fires is not to sacrifice and consume any living creature.
TIRUKURAL 26.1; 26.9. TWdo not want to change, but only to become more sensitive, as a group, to 
our beautiful Íaiva culture. Go over this sûtra with seekers quite openly. 
We cannot remind them too much, because we do want Íaiva children to 
grow up strong and to marry while still virgins . We do want to counteract 
the trends of the times by being a part of a greater wisdom. We do not 
want new seekers to bring their world into ours. They must be prepared to 
observe the eightfold celibacy  toward everyone but their spouse or be on 
their lustful way. As our Íaivite Íâstras  declare in verse 277 , “The chastity 
of all was the strength within the core of all.” 
Preparing
Youth for Adulthood318 ¶Through our course in brahmacharya , purity in 
thought, word and deed, parents teach their young, espe-

those who will marry and those destined for monastic life. When puberty

Ancient 
Insights onPuberty319 ¶V erse 490 of the Dravidian Íâstras describes the 
dawn of puberty  and the need for careful direction of 
instinctive drives: “Puberty begins when the awareness of 
the soul comes into the animal nerve system as a result of being in this 
particular kind of fleshy body. Before this time the body is maturing and 
growing, and the nerve system of the soul’s inner body governs it, much 
like it did when we had our original fibrous bodies. But when four cycles have passed, the external structure becomes firmed and strong and the 
instincts for mating occur. Therefore, it is important that these forces be 
carefully directed so that the soul is not clouded by instinctive drives and 
still maintains its inner contact with the three worlds.” 
Wisdom
RegardingPornography320 ¶Excessive violence and pornography  are two evils 
that can but should not creep into a household through 
games, TV , pictures shared by friends within the home. A 
watchful eye must be kept so this does not happen and affect the fami-
ly’s mental health. My edict on pornography is given in sûtra 59: “Íiva’s 
devotees are forbidden to speak of, listen to or look at exhibitions of  por-
nography. This adharma  is addictive, erodes self-esteem and teaches that 
degrading women, men and children is acceptable behavior. Aum.”
Celibacy
And AdultSingle Life321 ¶As explained in sûtra 107 , “Íiva’s unmarried  adoles-
cent and adult devotees are all considered  brahmachârîs or 
brahmachâri∫îs, bound to  the wise restraints of chastity 
that tradition prescribes, whether they have taken a celibacy  vow or not. 
Aum.” Adults who live the single life of the brahmachârî or brahmachâri∫î  
outside our monasteries are under the guidance of kulapati and kulamâtâ  
as a member of their spiritual family. Celibacy is also strictly upheld by 
widows and widowers  who elect not to  remarry, as stated in sûtra 102: 
“Íiva’s widowed devotees who choose not to remarry practice strict conti-
nence. They dedicate their lives  to God and  transmute  sexual forces into 
the higher  chakras through sâdhana,  worship and  brahmacharya . Aum.”
Íâstric 
Wisdom onCleanliness322 ¶It is well known that one’s environment has a pro-
found impact on his or her mental, emotional and spiritual 
being. We have affirmed this principle in sûtra 209: “Lovers 
of Íiva keep their  home and work  environment  clean and uncluttered to 
maintain a spiritual vibra tion and not attract negative forces. They seek 
fresh air and sunshine and surround themselves with beauty. Aum.” Our 
Íaivite Íâstras,  verse 49, set for the monasteries a pattern that all should 
How can he practice 
true compassion who eats the flesh of an ani-mal to fatten his own flesh? Greater than a thousand ghee offer-
ings consumed in sacrificial fires is not to sacrifice and consume any living creature.
TIRUKURAL 26.1; 26.9. TWdo not want to change, but only to become more sensitive, as a group, to 
our beautiful Íaiva culture. Go over this sûtra with seekers quite openly. 
We cannot remind them too much, because we do want Íaiva children to 
grow up strong and to marry while still virgins . We do want to counteract 
the trends of the times by being a part of a greater wisdom. We do not 
want new seekers to bring their world into ours. They must be prepared to 
observe the eightfold celibacy  toward everyone but their spouse or be on 
their lustful way. As our Íaivite Íâstras  declare in verse 277 , “The chastity 
of all was the strength within the core of all.” 
Preparing
Youth for Adulthood318 ¶Through our course in brahmacharya , purity in 
thought, word and deed, parents teach their young, espe-
cially be tween ages seven and thirteen, about the cycles of 
life, the principles of virtue  and the value of preserving the vital energies 
in preparation for the life ahead. These daily lessons are suited both to 
those who will marry and those destined for monastic life. When puberty 
arrives, boys and girls take the vow of celibacy, brahmacharya vrata . In 
fulfillment of this solemn oath, the individual vows to value and protect purity in thought, word and deed, and chastity in body, and to sublimate 
and transmute the sexual energies  and the instinctive impulses of anger, 
jealousy, greed, hatred and selfishness. A sacred cord  is worn around the 
waist to betoken this solemn oath. Parents share in this oath and accept 
full responsibility to see that it is fulfilled. Thus they closely guide the private and social life of children, monitoring and chaperoning their rela-

Bad Money 
Never ReapsRight Results325 ¶A crucial caution regarding money  is stated in sûtra 
52: “ All my followers know bad money can never do good 
deeds and refuse soiled funds from any source. Nor can 
good money used wrongly reap right results. Ill-gotten money is never 
well-spent, but has a curse upon it. Aum.” Bad money issues from a bad 
intent which precedes a wrong-doing for gain or profits. When the source is secret, the source of gain is suspect. When the source is freely divulged, it is freed from such apprehension. Let all family members know that they 
can and do create new kukarmas when dishonest acts accrue profit, and 
that these lay the foundation for future losses. In the Devaloka, there are those who monitor carefully, 24-hours a day, the sources of gain leading to wealth, because the prâ∫ic bonds are heavy for the wrongdoer and his 
accomplices. Admonish each member to, all through life, be cautious and aware of the source of their income.
Discerning
The Purity Of Funds326 ¶There are some who have postulated that using bad 
money  for good purposes cleanses it. Many among this 
group of misguided or naive individuals have lived to wit-
ness their own destruction through the use of it. Further, we know, those 
who give ill-gotten bounty money  to a religious institution will seek to 
infiltrate, dilute and eventually control the entire facility, including the 
guru, his monastic staff, members and students. When bad money is 
accepted, it will bring an avalanche of adharma leading to the dissolution 
of the fellowships that have succumbed, after which a new cycle would 
have to begin, of building back their fundamental policies to dharma once 
again. We, as followers of our paramaguru, the venerable Sage Y ogaswâmî, 
are bound to follow his example, to live simply, only overnighting in the 
homes of the vowed disciples who are living up to their vratas and to 
only accept ßukladâna, white money . Accepting bad money, k®ish∫adâna, 
brings in the asuras and binds the ma†havâsis to the external world in a 
web of obligations. How does one know if he has received k®ish∫a dâna? 
When one begins to feel obligated to the giver. This feeling does not come 
arise when ßukladâna is received because ßukladâna is money given freely 
for God’s work, and this its buying power is lasting. K®ish∫adâna is money

RegardingCleanliness 323 ¶In verse 266, the inner world beings reveal addition-

we judge the brahmachârî within their first six years as to their handling 
of physical objects, their cleanliness and sanitation. As flower and fruit 
perfume is seen here as beautiful emanations, dirt, filth and congestions, 
illy kept personal belongings, furniture and equipment are seen as ugly 
blobs emanating a disgusting fog in our world, the fog of decay. All physi-
cal belongings  should radiate the touch of humanness. They’re thought of; 
they’re cared for. They’re loved. This makes them glow and radiate, and through this glow we can even contact them and make minor repairs and 
adjustments.” The mystic relation between cleanliness and abundance 
was well known in ancient times, as explained in verse 325 of the Dra-
vidian Íâstras: “By keeping our monasteries in absolute order, a physical 
plane magnetism occurred, drawing others to our walls. If no one sat by 
our walls or came up to them to be lectured to through the holes in the 
walls, if our crops failed and the abundance  of our needs did not enter 
our storerooms, we always worked diligently to increase the magnetism  
through the perfection of our culture, bringing love, harmony, cleanliness 
and beauty into each minute area.”
Cleanliness,
Harmony andAbundance324 ¶This same wisdom must be applied in every family 
home, office and work area to create harmonious environ-

and now written, that when each family and ma†havâsi facility is clean,

a means of mors voluntaria religiosa.  Aum.” In our fellowship, the responsi-

and the elder kulapatis and kulamâtâs, whose duty it is to verify the clarity 
and sincerity of the request. It is up to them to discover when, where and 
if they support a competent request for voluntary departure. A flight to a 
more lenient country might be in order, a court order might be sought. It is 
traditional for Íaivites to journey to the holy city of V arâ∫asî  for their great 
departure, and this is always an option for those seeking release. These two questions and more will be before each sa˜gam that is petitioned to sup-

prâyopaveßa, through fasting and denying the intervention of intravenous 
feeding. Those who confer together in making these judgments will be left

to the Church community elders in the area, kulapatis and kulamâtâs, to 
confer together, consider deeply, then submit their conclusion to the Pî†ham

Transition Called Death327 ¶In Living with Íiva and Dancing with Íiva I have 
outlined guidelines for the elderly  and all who are facing 
death , the transition known in our ancient Veda s as mahâ-
prasthâna, “the great departure.” In the Íaivite Íâstras, the devas explain 
in verses 355-356: “We were always glad to see a Íaivite from one of the 
societies arrive fully into the Second World  and, of course, welcomed him 
as warmly and hospitably as our protocol permitted, endeavoring to make 
him realize that he had a function to perform before reentering another 
coil of flesh. The Society performs all the functions of the village. It con-ducts the funerals , the weddings and fulfills the ceremonial saμskâras of 
our religion. Branches of the Society were seen in later years to prepare 
homes for the aged  in Sri Lanka and India, where Americans would go to 
live and expire their forces, releasing them into our world.”
Making a
Natural Transition328 ¶V erses 364–365 of the Íaivite Íâstras advise, “Live 
as long as possible. Extend your life as long as vivacious 
intelligence extends itself.  Morbid thoughts and induced 
trances because of chemical concoctions are unacceptable to us, forfeiting the timing of your arrival and your stay, leading you back to hellish, black 
dismay. We then must search long for the whereabouts. But live the body out and do little. Don’t do much. The elderly should be cared for and all 
their wants fulfilled. Let them fix food when they are hungry, take care of 
clothes and worldly goods, feel responsibility which commands responses 
within the limits of their inability to fail.” I have given stipulations regard-
ing the issue of hospitalization and life support in sûtra 214: “Íiva’s devo-

heroic, artificial perpetuation of  life and prefer not to die in a hospital but 
at  home with  loved ones, who keep  prayerful  vigil. Aum.”

Scriptures
Speak onAbortion335 ¶K®ish∫a Yajur Veda,  6.5.10, states, “Therefore, a slay-
er of an embryo is like the slayer of a priest.” The Narada 
Dharma Íâstra, 12.92, states: “One who wastes the entire 
property of her husband under the pretense that it is her wifely gift, or 
who procures abortion or who makes an attempt on her husband’s life 
shall be banished by him from the town.” The Apastamba Dharma Íâs-
tra says, “Now, the actions which cause loss of caste: these are stealing 
gold,…homicide, neglect of the Veda s,  causing abortion .” Gaurama Dhar-
ma Íâstras states, “ A woman becomes an outcaste by procuring abortion.” 
Kautiliya’s Arthaßâstra  declares, “When a person causes abortion in preg-
nancy by striking, by medicine or by annoyance, the highest, middle and 
lesser punishments shall be imposed respectively.” Finally, the âyurveda 
scripture Íußruta Saμhitâ , Chikitsasthana 15.1-11, stipulates: “In an irre-
deemable situation, it is best to cause the miscarriage of the fe tus, for no 
means must be neglected which can prevent the loss of the mother.”

Impact ofAbortion336 ¶Rebirth is powerfully interrupted by the abortion 
process. It is a bold rejection of the soul’s anticipated entry

insights: having detached from the inner worlds to join a new family, the 
aborted soul is left stranded in the subtle Pretaloka (lower astral) region. 
He is now like a person stranded in an airport. All flights have been can-
celled. He checked out of his room in the Hotel Svarga or maybe the less exclusive Naraka Inn, paid his bill, and those rooms are no longer available. 
He must make a new plan, chart an alternate itinerary, endure untimely 
delays and await another flight to his destination, where, he desperately 
hopes, there will be a womb for rent!

6.78.1–2. BO AVW , 339The Vedic
View onAbortion333 ¶Many reasons are put forward for a liberal abortion  
policy, such as population control and avoiding unwanted 
children. Personal reasons for obtaining abortion include 
inadequate finances, interruption of education or career, too many chil-
dren in the family already, bad home, unmarried mother, mother too 
young, adultery, incest, rape, mental or physical defects of the fetus and 
possible death of mother. Sociologically, the growing rate of abortion is related to the increasing urbanization of the world’s population. Children 
in the city are not the labor asset they were in the agricultural coun-
tryside. Hence, as countries become urbanized, birth rates drop rapidly through contraception coupled with abortion as a backup. Hinduism’s 
ancient texts contain numerous verses condemning bhrunahati, the killing 
of the embryo . They do so because Hinduism, like other religions, believes 
the soul  joins the fetus at conception. The human soul has five sheaths, 
koßas , though which it functions simultaneously in the various planes or 
levels of existence. The annamaya koßa, “sheath composed of food,” is the 
physical body. The  prâ∫amaya koßa, “sheath composed of prâ∫a” (vital 
force), is also known as the prâ∫ic or health body. The third sheath, the 
manomaya koßa, is the instinctive-intellectual sheath of ordinary thought, 
desire and emotion. This  koßa takes form as the physical body develops 
and is later discarded in the inner worlds before a new birth is taken. The 
vijñânamaya koßa is the mental or cognitive sheath. The fifth sheath, the 
ânandamaya koßa, “body of bliss,” is the soul  itself, a body of light created 
by God long ago. The vijñânamaya koßa and ânandamaya koßa are the 
bodies that go from birth to birth; the others are grown again each life. Írî 
Aurobindo  elucidates the process: “When the soul returns to birth, it takes 
up with its mental, vital and physical sheaths as much of its karma as is 
useful to it in the new life for further experience.” 
Scriptural
ExplanationOf Incarnation334 ¶The Kulâr∫ava Tantra 1.16, teaches us that “Human 
birth, ladder to liberation, is difficult to attain.” The Mar-
kandeya Purâ∫a 10.1–7 , 11.1–21, explains the birth process. 
“The impregnation of human women is the emitting of the seed in the men-
strual blood. As soon as the soul is released from Naraka (hell) or from 
Svarga (heaven), it arrives in the womb.  Overpowered by that soul, the 
two-fold seed becomes solid.…Then it begins to remember its many previ-
ous existences in the wheel of rebirth, and that depresses it, and it tosses 
from side to side, thinking, ‘I won’t ever do that again, as soon as I get out 
of this womb, I will do everything I can so that I won’t become an embryo

338 ¶Each chakravâla , a circle or sa˜ga of devotees, is seated clockwise 
according to seniority age , jyesh†hatâ . As each one present looks up the 
circle, he or she sees others of more experience, more dedication and hope-
fully more wisdom. The positioning according to seniority  in each chakra-
vâla stimulates respect and appreciation for those who are more senior, 
and it awakens tolerance and understanding for those who are younger. 
Through the chakravâla, the Gods and devas work with the group as a 
one mind, a one body, a one energy to bring through the divine, intuitive 
knowing that resides in all present. When a proper circle is formed for 
an excellent reason, deva influence can become exceedingly strong. Each 
chakra vâla has its stated purpose, and devonic help or inner intelligence is 
attracted to heighten each member’s superconsciousness. When contention arises, however, many devas  leave. Asuric forces of the lower worlds rush 
in, but are hopefully kept at bay by the guardian devas of all present.  
How We
CalculateSeniority339 ¶Calculation of seniority age  is done by adding 
together physical age, nâmakara∫a age and membership 
age. The sum of these three creates the seniority age—an 
ingenious devonic innovation based on ancient tradition of seniority by 
physical age alone—to establish the protocol of respect and seating order for optimum productivity. When there is a tie in seniority in a chakravâla , 
the person older in physical years takes the more senior position. Senior-
ity age  is recalculated once each year, at the beginning of Moksha ‰itau 
in mid-December. This age holds through the entire year and does not 
change. All students  and guests in a chakravâla sit in the circle in order of 
their physical age.
Seating Order
For Mixed Groups340 ¶In cases where a mixed group of members, stu-
dents and guests all join in one chakravâla , the order is 
as follows. The kulapati men sit first, followed by the other

Circleseat demands. Here are the five chakravâla positions: 
1. talaivar, t^lvrf, the chairperson, host or scribe; 
2. pechâlar, Epcfcaqaf, spokesperson to groups; 
3. padipâlar, pFpfpaqrf, the reader and pujârî; 
4. sabaiyor: cApEyaa f, assembly persons; 
5. tûtuvar: T\Tva f, the messenger to individuals. 
The Talaivar:
Chairperson And Scribe343 ¶The ßishya who is most senior occupies the first 
seat in the chakravâla. The seat names him talaivar , the 
chairperson, host and guru’s scribe. He prepares the agenda 
before each meeting. He carries messages from the Pî†ham to the group 
during the meeting and from each within the group back to the Pî†ham. 
The extent of such communication varies depending on the nature of the 
gathering. The closest communication is maintained by the council on 
missions at its  preshana chakravâla, for this gathering is a pure conduit 
to and from the Guru Mahâsannidhânam , his official voice to the mission. 
Spontaneous gatherings are on the other end of the spectrum. They com-
municate with the Pî†ham as needed. 
The Pechâlar:
Spokesman toGroups344 ¶The ßishya who occupies the second seat in the 
chakravâla is the pechâlar , the person who conveys mes-
sages to groups and makes announcements when called 
upon to do so by the talaivar . Within certain mission groups, it is the 
pechâlar who serves as the fund-raiser and treasurer when necessary, 
though he may supervise helpers. Whenever appropriate, the pechâlar 
of the council on missions represents the Kailâsa Pî†ham to important 
people in the community by making courtesy calls, with one or two mis-
sion kulapatis accompanying him. The pechâlar  of the council on mis-
sions , like the monastery pechâlar, is responsible for the care of guests , 
the sincere pilgrim or visitor. It is his duty to coordinate the stay, includ-
ing assisting with accommodations as needed, be it in a family home, a 
hotel or other rented facility. 
Padipâlar,
Tûtuvar andSabaiyors345 ¶The ßishya who occupies the third seat in the 
chakravâla is the pa∫∂aram priest , padipâlar . He gives a 
scriptural reading at every meeting. He conducts pûjâs and 
other forms of worship, leads in bhajana and meditation. He  is also the 
helper of the pechâlar, and both of them receive help from the tûtuvar 
when needed. The ßishya who is youngest in seniority occupies the last 
seat in the chakravâla, and is the messenger, or tûtuvar . He posts mail and 
performs various other simple duties . The tûtuvar , for example would be 
Devoted to sacrifice, 
gathering wealth, they serve the Immor-tal and honor the Gods, united in mutual love.
‰IG VEDA 8.31.9. VE, 265the youngest male is the tûtuvar and sits to the right of the talaivar . The 
female portion of the circle begins with the kulamâtâs, then the other 
married women (including widows and divorcees) , followed by the single 
females (including girls), followed by the ®ishimâtâs, and then the avowed 
brahmachâri∫îs.  Now, we can see that a chakravâla can comprise several 
circles forming a greater circle. When mixed groups gather, oftentimes 
two or more separate chakravâlas may be formed for the various distinct 
groups, such as one for the males, one for the females and another for 
children. When the guru or his representative attends a meeting, he sits as 
talaivar. Any monks accompanying him sit beside him, the junior monk 
to his right as tûtuvar , and all others to his left. During the meeting, the 
ma†havâsis fulfill the duties of the seats they hold, but these duties rarely 
continue outside the meeting.
Chakravâlas,
Circles ofPrâ∫a Magic341 ¶After the group is seated and the opening ßloka is 
chanted (“Sahanâ vavatu…”), each in turn mentally sends 
prâ∫a  to the one at his left. Soon a complete harmony is 
felt, as the prâ∫as begin to flow clockwise from one to another through 
the psychic nerve system of all present, round and round and round. As this happens each devotee keeps his attention firmly upon the center of the circle and projects there any negative thoughts or feelings that may 
arise. That energy soon is dissolved in the greater flow of divine energy. 
When all are lifted up into superconsciousness, good service to Íiva can 
be performed. It is then, when the higher chakras are stimulated, that the 
chakravâla of guardian devas  of each one present can communicate. At 
certain times, even the sapta ®ishis  participate. Such are the mysteries of 
the Nâthas.
Duties of the
ChakravâlaPositions 342 ¶The talaivar  guides the meeting. He is the Guru 
Mahâ sannidhânam’s scribe, the person who later conveys 
to him what has transpired at the meeting and seeks direc-
tion. The talaivar  has two assistants: the pechâlar, or spokesman to any 
group, and the tûtuvar, or messenger to individuals. The pechâlar sits to the 
left of the talaivar . He is the second eldest. The next eldest is the padipâlar, 
the priest, followed by the assembly persons, called sabaiyors. The tûtuvar 
sits to the right of the talaivar . He is the youngest in seniority. For example, 
the circle for five ßishyas would look like this: talaivar,  pechâlar, padipâlar, 
sabaiyor and tûtuvar . A chakravâla is always complete. No seat is reserved 
for an absentee. The next persons in seniority always move up a seat or 
two to fill the vacancy and assume the corresponding responsibilities the

Tûtuvar andSabaiyors345 ¶The ßishya who occupies the third seat in the 
chakravâla is the pa∫∂aram priest , padipâlar . He gives a 
scriptural reading at every meeting. He conducts pûjâs and 
other forms of worship, leads in bhajana and meditation. He  is also the 
helper of the pechâlar, and both of them receive help from the tûtuvar 
when needed. The ßishya who is youngest in seniority occupies the last 
seat in the chakravâla, and is the messenger, or tûtuvar . He posts mail and 
performs various other simple duties . The tûtuvar , for example would be 
Devoted to sacrifice, 
gathering wealth, they serve the Immor-tal and honor the Gods, united in mutual love.
‰IG VEDA 8.31.9. VE, 265the youngest male is the tûtuvar and sits to the right of the talaivar . The 
female portion of the circle begins with the kulamâtâs, then the other 
married women (including widows and divorcees) , followed by the single 
females (including girls), followed by the ®ishimâtâs, and then the avowed 
brahmachâri∫îs.  Now, we can see that a chakravâla can comprise several 
circles forming a greater circle. When mixed groups gather, oftentimes 
two or more separate chakravâlas may be formed for the various distinct 
groups, such as one for the males, one for the females and another for 
children. When the guru or his representative attends a meeting, he sits as 
talaivar. Any monks accompanying him sit beside him, the junior monk 
to his right as tûtuvar , and all others to his left. During the meeting, the 
ma†havâsis fulfill the duties of the seats they hold, but these duties rarely 
continue outside the meeting.
Chakravâlas,
Circles ofPrâ∫a Magic341 ¶After the group is seated and the opening ßloka is 
chanted (“Sahanâ vavatu…”), each in turn mentally sends 
prâ∫a  to the one at his left. Soon a complete harmony is 
felt, as the prâ∫as begin to flow clockwise from one to another through 
the psychic nerve system of all present, round and round and round. As this happens each devotee keeps his attention firmly upon the center of the circle and projects there any negative thoughts or feelings that may 
arise. That energy soon is dissolved in the greater flow of divine energy. 
When all are lifted up into superconsciousness, good service to Íiva can 
be performed. It is then, when the higher chakras are stimulated, that the 
chakravâla of guardian devas  of each one present can communicate. At 
certain times, even the sapta ®ishis  participate. Such are the mysteries of 
the Nâthas.
Duties of the
ChakravâlaPositions 342 ¶The talaivar  guides the meeting. He is the Guru 
Mahâ sannidhânam’s scribe, the person who later conveys 
to him what has transpired at the meeting and seeks direc-
tion. The talaivar  has two assistants: the pechâlar, or spokesman to any 
group, and the tûtuvar, or messenger to individuals. The pechâlar sits to the 
left of the talaivar . He is the second eldest. The next eldest is the padipâlar, 
the priest, followed by the assembly persons, called sabaiyors. The tûtuvar 
sits to the right of the talaivar . He is the youngest in seniority. For example, 
the circle for five ßishyas would look like this: talaivar,  pechâlar, padipâlar, 
sabaiyor and tûtuvar . A chakravâla is always complete. No seat is reserved 
for an absentee. The next persons in seniority always move up a seat or 
two to fill the vacancy and assume the corresponding responsibilities the

Rather, those coordinating the project make the decisions, and those work-

Unanimous
AgreementAs to Timing348 ¶The edict of unanimous agreement on timing was 
given in our Lord Subramaniam Íâstras  for the monastery 
senior group of elders . It refers to innovations, setting new 
projects into motion and changing existing patterns. In all such matters, 
the Íâstras say, the guru  is the supreme guide. In order to proceed with full 
energy, it is important that there be a oneness of wills among all who are 
working directly with the guru in implementing the change or innova-
tion. Our Íaivite Íâstras  refer to this as judging the timing of implemen-
tation. In the family community, this has its parallel application only in 
our councils on missions, wherein the guru relies on the kulapatis in their 
preshana chakravâla to “nod on timing ” before setting in motion innova-
tions he has approved. The Dravidian Íâstras  explain in verse 379 that in 
the Dvapara Yuga, “ Any change or alteration in the flow of the monastery 
or the timing of an event, even if our guru instigated it, had to have a 
unanimous nod of approval from this senior group.”
Seeking 
Silent InnerConsensus349 ¶However, the Íâstras  state, “If the discussion oc curred 
more than a moment or so, the matter was referred to our 
guru  for elucidation. For we are just a channel for the Deity, 
a dispenser, a container, a holder of ßakti. We endeavor not to lower His 
vibration into the intellect of words and discussion other than to convey 
information of which our answers are found quickly within our ßâstras 
and from our guru. The pattern is set, was set long ago, and to fulfill it 
is our function.” V erse 380 elaborates, “It was in the Second World, with 
the devas and our guru  at night, when we all slept on these inner planes, 
that discussion occurred, clarification was given. This is why when issues 
arose, we informed the devas in writing through the sacred fire and met 
with them there, for our senior circle met in two worlds. And so, in the 
First World we always endeavored to sit and feel what had occurred 
the night before. And it was through feeling that the unanimous nod of 
approval or disapproval occurred.” 
Not Applying
Unanimous Agreement350 ¶Unanimous decision  in our fellowship is blended in 
wisdom with the equally important principle of seniority. 
The delicate dance between these two creates a buoyant 
feeling of joy, cooperation and one-mindedness in all activities. While the 
elders guide those under their direction, there is never a sense of “your

from the Pî†ham to be conveyed to an individual, he gives it to the tûtuvar 
during the meeting to deliver after the meeting. Such messages can be conveyed verbally or in writing.  The ßishyas who occupy all the other 
seats in the chakravâla are the sabaiyors , the ones who sit in attendance. 
In the council on missions chakravâla, they listen in silence, only speak-

Working
Together In Harmony346 ¶Because we follow the chakravâla tradition, there is 
a natural harmony  existing in our missions and in each 
gathering of ßishya. Rarely is much discussion required 
when activities are being carried out, for the lines of authority  based on 
seniority are always clear. The chakravâla is the first boon  given by me 
to maintain a spiritual harmony among followers, which is the primary 
imperative, as emphasized in sûtra 15, “Those who live with Íiva have zero 
tolerance for  dis harmonious conditions. In the home and beyond, they 
settle diff erences when others can only disagree. Jai, they are all instru-
ments of  peace. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.”

lowship meetings must unanimously agree and obtain the 
satguru’s blessings before finalizing any project. No votes 
are taken based on the majority superseding the minority. Aum.” There 
has been some misunderstanding of this sûtra, for it has sometimes been 
interpreted to mean that everyone should be consulted on every step of 
every task. Therefore, we offer the following summary and explanation. 
1.   In our fellowship there is no voting , which is based on majority rule, 
as is the procedure in democratic bodies. 
2. Harmony of minds and wills is our cardinal principle. It is natural to 
our fellowship because all members hold the same beliefs, all live by the

3.   The existence of the fellowship and each of its gatherings is for the 
purpose of carrying out the mission of the mission as described and clari-fied by the Guru Mahâsannidhânam in his divine wisdom. Therefore, his 
blessings are always sought before finalizing any projects.

FollowingChapter352 ¶The chapter that follows is about the administra-
tion and religious service among an established mission of 
Íiva’s devotees in many countries of the world. They have 
gathered together not to socialize or become friends, but to be a life-long 
family of devotees related not by blood but by spirit. Here we shall see 
that missions are the outcome of the sought-after-and-rarely-attained inter-
family harmony, with no back-biting, no disagreement whatsoever that is 
not quickly reconciled, only service, Íivaseva, Íivathondu, as they take joy 
in the fulfillment of the mission of the Paramparâ. 
T o the heavens be peace, to the sky and the earth; to the waters be peace,

must be careful that unanimous decision not open the door to needless 
discussion, which can lead to argument and insubordination. Those who are  leading must take the lead. Those in charge are responsible to abide 
by the principles of compassion and kindness. Sûtra 17 reminds us, “Those 
who live with Íiva are honorable, cheerful, modest and full of courtesy. 
Having removed the darkness of anger, fear, jealousy and contempt for 
others, their faces radiate the kindly compassion of their  soul. Aum.” One 
final principle, never to be forgotten, is that unanimous agreement  on tim-

It does not apply when such participation is not invited. Sûtra 265 explains, 
“My devotees never apply the principle of unanimous agreement to sover-

Formal and 
InformalChakravâlas 351 ¶A formal chakravâla  is a gathering of an administra-

cial, chakravâlas are councils on missions, meetings of the 
Hindu Businessmen’s Association and the Hindu Workingmen’s Associa-
tion and Hindu Heritage Endowment gatherings of kulapatis or kulamâtâs . 
All formal chakravâlas are begun and ended with the official chakravâla  
chant, Sahanâ V avatu. There are also informal chakravâlas among women 
and men, youth and students, in homes, temples, meeting halls, restau-
rants, etc., for various purposes. Examples of informal chakravâlas  are 
weekly satsa˜gas, dinner meetings, picnics, committees or action groups 
carrying out activities that have been set in motion through the council on missions, and any spontaneous gathering of devotees who prefer to rec-ognize and respect seniority and receive the blessings of the collective 
group of guardian devas by forming a proper divine circle. At each such 
gathering, there is a talaivar, pechâlar, tûtuvar, etc. The talaivar of each 
informal group performs the function of host and sees that the gathering is successful. The three helpers assist the talaivar as per our tradition, the

353 ¶All missions  are bound to follow the instructions given in these 
Íaiva Dharma Íâstras, 1995 edition . It is imperative that all heed all edicts 
given from the Kailâsa Pî†ham at Kauai Aadheenam. Many of these dic-
tates are brought forth in these Íâstras, and more will come in special 
addendums and bhâshyas  from time to time as we grow and expand our 
horizons. It must be emphasized that all fellowship missions are guided 
directly by Kauai Aadheenam. Missions are not guided by our branch 
monasteries or national Church bodies, such as Íaiva Siddhânta Church 
of Mauritius. Missions are not branches of the parent Church. They are extensions of the parent Church, and all the missions make up the body of the whole. Missions have no decision-making authority. They are local congregations joining together in the name of the Church for the purposes of worship, study and personal change through self effort. 
Participation
And ChurchGuidance354 ¶The principles of mission membership are as follows:
1. Each mission is an extension of the parent Church, whose 
international headquarters and spiritual nucleus is Kauai 
Aadheenam in Hawaii, USA.
2. Membership in the mission is restricted to members of the parent 
Church . Therefore, each mission is an association of local members who 
are part of the world assembly of devotees.
3. Parent Church membership is renewed yearly by formally rededicat-
ing one’s loyalties to the Guru Mahâsannidhânam at Guru Pûr∫imâ in July. 
Those who do not rededicate at that time are not eligible to participate in 
activities. 
4. Missions are encouraged to hold a yearly one-day open house , before 
or during Pañcha Ga∫apati, in December, for students, neighbors, friends and relatives to familiarize them with the teachings. An open house may 
be held by one mission or by two or more missions joining together.

the faith and tradition and serve the needs of the local con-
gregation. Through its activities, each council on missions ,

Íaiva Dharma Íâstras, 1995 edition . It is imperative that all heed all edicts 
given from the Kailâsa Pî†ham at Kauai Aadheenam. Many of these dic-
tates are brought forth in these Íâstras, and more will come in special 
addendums and bhâshyas  from time to time as we grow and expand our 
horizons. It must be emphasized that all fellowship missions are guided 
directly by Kauai Aadheenam. Missions are not guided by our branch 
monasteries or national Church bodies, such as Íaiva Siddhânta Church 
of Mauritius. Missions are not branches of the parent Church. They are extensions of the parent Church, and all the missions make up the body of the whole. Missions have no decision-making authority. They are local congregations joining together in the name of the Church for the purposes of worship, study and personal change through self effort. 
Participation
And ChurchGuidance354 ¶The principles of mission membership are as follows:
1. Each mission is an extension of the parent Church, whose 
international headquarters and spiritual nucleus is Kauai 
Aadheenam in Hawaii, USA.
2. Membership in the mission is restricted to members of the parent 
Church . Therefore, each mission is an association of local members who 
are part of the world assembly of devotees.
3. Parent Church membership is renewed yearly by formally rededicat-
ing one’s loyalties to the Guru Mahâsannidhânam at Guru Pûr∫imâ in July. 
Those who do not rededicate at that time are not eligible to participate in 
activities. 
4. Missions are encouraged to hold a yearly one-day open house , before 
or during Pañcha Ga∫apati, in December, for students, neighbors, friends and relatives to familiarize them with the teachings. An open house may 
be held by one mission or by two or more missions joining together.
The Purpose
Of ChurchMissions355 ¶The primary objective of each mission  is to preserve 
the faith and tradition and serve the needs of the local con-
gregation. Through its activities, each council on missions ,

even so all beings expectantly sit round the agnihotra. 
Sâma Veda, ChandU 5.24.4. VE, 412
The unholy town where no temple stands, the town where men do not 
wear the holy ash, the town which does not resound with sacred song, the town which is not resplendent with many shrines, the town where the white conch is not reverently blown, the town where festive canopies and white flags are not seen, the town where devotees do not gather flowers for the worship rite, that town is no town. It is a mere wilderness.
Tirumurai 6.309.5. PS, 149
There is no difference between devotion and perfect knowledge. 
A person who is engrossed in devotion enjoys perpetual happiness. And perfect knowledge never descends in a vicious person averse to devotion.
Íiva Purâ∫a, Rudra S. 23.16. AI, vol.1, 380
They labor hard and gather flowers and carry water pure. 
They adore the Lord in unfailing piety and at His shining Feet lay flowers and stand and pray, and unto the rain-laden clouds forever prosperous shall they be. 
Tirumantiram 1839. TM, 349
It is devotion to God, Íiva bhakti , alone that makes a man blessed. 
Everything else is useless. Therefore, without break, practice Íivadhyâna. Do not be afraid of anything. Victory will be yours!
Natchintanai, “Íivabhakti.” NT, 7
He folded his hands in adoration and praised the Lord’s feet. 
His deep love melted in a stream, the flood from his eyes gushed out and spread over his body.
Periyapurâ∫am 5.21, verse 253. PS, 49
What has learning profited a man, if it has not lead him 
to worship the good feet of Him who is pure knowledge itself? They alone dispel the mind’s distress who take refuge at the feet of the Incomparable One.

Church (name of city, state or province) Mission. This name 
is used for all letterheads, newsletters and other printed lit-
erature, for signs, and for introductions at public events. For example, the 
letterhead for the mission in Beau Bassin, Mauritius, would read: “Íaiva 
Siddhânta Church Beau Bassin Mission.” This pattern has been well estab-
lished through use for many years. Hindus around the world have come to be proud of their Hindu Church and want to see it flourish and grow. Even 
the two words Hindu Church  have been a boon from the Gods to prevent 
conversion. The great Swâmî Vivekânanda , who inspired me to take san-
nyâsa,  was also the one who inspired me to fulfill a vision to establish 
an international Hindu church. No one religion owns the word church . 
All Church members and Academy students shall be proud to uphold the 
name Íaiva Siddhânta Church and never seek to change it. Thus, they glo-
rify our Hindu Church as an international body of devotees upholding the 
dharma of the Veda s to the best of their ability, with individual and col-
lective goals reaching farther than the farthest star. For information on 
translating the word church into other languages, see chapter one.

Seal: theTripu∫∂ra361 ¶Each mission has a common seal  bearing its official 
name. This seal includes the Church symbol or logo, called 
the tripu∫∂ra,  consisting of a colored circle with three hor-
izontal white lines or stripes across the middle. In the center is a small 
circle the same color as the emblem itself with a white center about one 
fifth the size of the larger circle. This emblem represents the renowned 
Íaivite symbol, three stripes of gleaming vibhûti (holy ash) across the 
brow. Holy ash  connotes purity, and the three lines signify the burning 
away of the soul’s triple bondage of â∫ava (veil of duality), karma (effects 
of past deeds) and mâyâ (the principle of matter). The dot or small circle 
in the middle represents the pottu , the dot  worn by Íiva’s devotees at the 
point of the third eye, signifying the soul’s spiritual faculties and insight. 
The mind, indeed, is 
this fleeting world. Therefore, it should be purified with great effort. One becomes like that which is in one’s mind—this is the everlasting secret.

Satguru andMa†havâsis358 ¶It is up to each mission to extend invitations to 
the guru and his ma†havâsi sevakas  for each mission and 
group of missions when they feel they are ready for change, 
new input and revitalization. This is in accord with tradition—and it is a 
tradition which is crucial to maintain—whereby the ßishya comes to the 
master, rather than the guru feeling obligated to go to the ßishya. However, 
in the 21st century global village all devotees cannot always be near their 
guru, for he may live in another nation many thousands of miles away. 
Thus the new duty of the collective group of ßishyas is to invite the guru  
and/or his ma†havâsis to come to them, to revitalize their community. 
Through their collective sâdhanas the devotees are ready to receive the 
ma†havâsis and make all arrangements within their own mission and the 
community at large. Having the Guru Mahâsannidhânam present and/or 
his âchâryas, swâmîs, yogîs  and sâdhakas is accomplished by all the local 
missions within the country giving earnest invitations at the proper time .
How New
MissionsAre Formed359 ¶One or more kulapati families gathering in a par-
ticular geographical region may seek blessings to create a 
mission through filling out a written invitation sent from 
the Aadheenam. In order to form a mission , at least one home among the 
families must meet the mission-house standards described later in this 
chapter. When the mission document is agreed to and signed and permis-
sion has been granted, they gather at an auspicious time and take the mis-sion vow  promising to uphold to the best of their ability the following five 
sûtras from Living with Íiva and all other guidelines accompanying the 
responsibility they are undertaking together.

Mission
HouseStandards366 ¶The mission house must be a true Íaiva kulapati 
home blessed by traditional priests, totally free from asuric 
influences, and in which there are no prevalent non-Asian 
symbols, such as Western religious artifacts, a grand piano or guitar, com-
petitive sport trophies, European sculptures or paintings other than land-
scapes and seascapes. There is no criticism attached to the presence of 
non-Asian symbols as described above, but it is only natural that they 
be gradually replaced or discarded as ßishyas come deeper into the pure 
Íaiva way. Within these pure homes, supâtra g®iha, one sees Íaiva imag-
es everywhere. Most prominently, photos of the satguru are displayed in 
nearly every room . T o qualify as a mission house, it must be a dwelling 
in which all who live in the home, including relatives and guests, are 
Church members and in which only vegetarian meals are served, where 
no meat, fish, fowl, shellfish or eggs are ever served to humans. One of the meanings of Saivam is “vegetarian” in the Tamil Lexicon. ) It is not pos-
sible to establish a mission house in a home where the wife works in the 
world, even in the case of the husband being ill or temporarily unable to 
provide for the family. The g®ihi∫î must be a full-time wife and mother. Of 
course, the family’s regular monthly tithing must be up to date. Conduct-
ing a household with standards in variance to the Íaiva traditions stated 
above reflects an attitude, sets an example and reveals the underlying 
belief of the family. It is imperative that the kulapatis and kulamâtâs visit 
the home of arulßishyas , prospective members, to assure themselves that 
these devotees are who they say they are by seeing whether they are ful-
filling the basic requirements of dharmic living, and to gently assist the 
truly sincere to make the necessary adjustments. Thus, it is essential that the mission house set a perfect example. 
About Mission
GatheringPlaces367 ¶The need for mission gathering places has always 
been amply met by the homes of members, Church mon-
asteries and public temples. Other than their own homes, 
family members do not individually or collectively purchase or rent per-
manent facilities for Church or Academy activities. In early years this was 
tried, but usually the first and invariably the second generation of man-
agement was not harmonious. The consequences led to failure and a strain on the monastic community who then had to move into the facilities and eventually dispose of the property. When a mission  has grown too large to 
meet in a single home, it can, with the guru’s blessings, divide itself into 
Peaceful for us be the 
planets and the moon, peaceful the sun and râhu.
ATHARV A VEDA 19.9.10. GK, 161About Social
Service andPolitics362 ¶Each local mission is managed through a council 
on missions of extended family patriarchs called kulapatis . 
The council will, from time to time, be required as part of 
its civic duty to concern itself with community events, with war, with 
health or medical services, and material relief to the underprivileged, the 
poor, the handicapped, the uneducated, the homeless or the aged. These are 
all matters of important and abiding interest to those who have awakened compassion for their fellow man. These concerns, however, should never over-balance the mission’s religious objectives. Mission gatherings are 
never used as political forums and members never participate in political 
block voting. Nor do members and students at official gatherings unduly

Mission House 363 ¶Each mission has a gathering place, called the mis-
sion house , the home of a kulapati, which functions as a 
hospitality and information center for members and guests, 
providing security, stability and hospitality for the ongoing work of the fellowship as a whole. It is the site of the monthly full-moon gathering, and 
it provides an address for the mission. It is in the mission house that the 
holy tiruvadi reside, the pictures of the Paramparâ are displayed, the Gods 
and the havana ku∫∂a  (the fire altar in which prayers are burned) are 
installed and artifacts given by the Kailâsa Pî†ham are enshrined. The 
mission house  is reestablished each year, in mid-December, at the begin-
ning of the third season, with a house blessing  performed by a Íivâchârya 
or a monastic priest. When possible, a different home is selected each year 
so that the responsibility and blessings are equally shared. The sacred 
items are moved to the new location.
The Mission 
HouseLibrary364 ¶A mission library, maintained by the ßishyas, is kept 
in each mission house. Here books, pamphlets, videos as 
well as photocopies of rare publications are collected and 
made available to members and guests. These are all publications of, or 
approved by, the Kailâsa Paramparâ.

Mission
HouseStandards366 ¶The mission house must be a true Íaiva kulapati 
home blessed by traditional priests, totally free from asuric 
influences, and in which there are no prevalent non-Asian 
symbols, such as Western religious artifacts, a grand piano or guitar, com-
petitive sport trophies, European sculptures or paintings other than land-
scapes and seascapes. There is no criticism attached to the presence of 
non-Asian symbols as described above, but it is only natural that they 
be gradually replaced or discarded as ßishyas come deeper into the pure 
Íaiva way. Within these pure homes, supâtra g®iha, one sees Íaiva imag-
es everywhere. Most prominently, photos of the satguru are displayed in 
nearly every room . T o qualify as a mission house, it must be a dwelling 
in which all who live in the home, including relatives and guests, are 
Church members and in which only vegetarian meals are served, where 
no meat, fish, fowl, shellfish or eggs are ever served to humans. One of the meanings of Saivam is “vegetarian” in the Tamil Lexicon. ) It is not pos-
sible to establish a mission house in a home where the wife works in the 
world, even in the case of the husband being ill or temporarily unable to 
provide for the family. The g®ihi∫î must be a full-time wife and mother. Of 
course, the family’s regular monthly tithing must be up to date. Conduct-
ing a household with standards in variance to the Íaiva traditions stated 
above reflects an attitude, sets an example and reveals the underlying 
belief of the family. It is imperative that the kulapatis and kulamâtâs visit 
the home of arulßishyas , prospective members, to assure themselves that 
these devotees are who they say they are by seeing whether they are ful-
filling the basic requirements of dharmic living, and to gently assist the 
truly sincere to make the necessary adjustments. Thus, it is essential that the mission house set a perfect example. 
About Mission
GatheringPlaces367 ¶The need for mission gathering places has always 
been amply met by the homes of members, Church mon-
asteries and public temples. Other than their own homes, 
family members do not individually or collectively purchase or rent per-
manent facilities for Church or Academy activities. In early years this was 
tried, but usually the first and invariably the second generation of man-
agement was not harmonious. The consequences led to failure and a strain on the monastic community who then had to move into the facilities and eventually dispose of the property. When a mission  has grown too large to 
meet in a single home, it can, with the guru’s blessings, divide itself into 
Peaceful for us be the 
planets and the moon, peaceful the sun and râhu.
ATHARV A VEDA 19.9.10. GK, 161About Social
Service andPolitics362 ¶Each local mission is managed through a council 
on missions of extended family patriarchs called kulapatis . 
The council will, from time to time, be required as part of 
its civic duty to concern itself with community events, with war, with 
health or medical services, and material relief to the underprivileged, the 
poor, the handicapped, the uneducated, the homeless or the aged. These are 
all matters of important and abiding interest to those who have awakened compassion for their fellow man. These concerns, however, should never over-balance the mission’s religious objectives. Mission gatherings are 
never used as political forums and members never participate in political 
block voting. Nor do members and students at official gatherings unduly 
engage in talk of politics, though each is elsewhere free to pursue actively 
his or her individual political persuasions. Political and social agendas are 
confined to their separate arenas, being healthy and positive parts of the 
g®ihastha dharma  but not to be intertwined with religious activities.

FinancialGuidelines370 ¶ 1. Missions do not solicit contributions without writ-
ten permission from the parent Church, and only for ongo-
ing projects of the parent Church or for one-time projects 
for the mission itself, such as travel expenses for a ma†havâsi or a special 
homa at a nearby temple or a scholarship for an Academy student .
2. All mission finances are conducted on a strict cash basis. No bank 
accounts are allowed. If funds are inadvertently collected beyond the 
intended purpose the excess monies are refunded to the givers. 
3. Gifts in kind , such as milk, food, incense and altar supplies should be 
given generously at mission functions, especially those held in homes, to 
alleviate financial strain on the hosting family. 
In previous years missions did handle their own funds and bank accounts. In some this became a source of contention or a source of pride in one’s 
mission being more abundant than another. The small allotment to the 
Aadheenam was difficult to collect and the receiving of accounting even 
more so. Thus, service became, at times, a source of contention, something no one intended and no one enjoys. 
Growth and
Division;Dissolution 371 ¶As a mission grows in its number of families, 
members and students, it may be divided into smaller missions.  All missions and the members within them are 
extensions of the parent Church in Hawaii, dedicated to serving the Kailâ-
sa Paramparâ. Missions never think of themselves as different or separate 
from the Parent Church. 
A mission may be dissolved by a resolution of the 
council on missions with the blessings of the Kailâsa Pî†ham. In the event of dissolution of the mission, the council agrees to not use the name Íaiva 
Siddhânta Church, nor an equivalent name, at any time or in any way. Pos-
sessions, such as religious artifacts, in the care of the mission would be dis-
tributed as directed by the stewards of the parent Church in Hawaii, USA.

For PersonalRetreats368 ¶The mission house  is closed whenever the host fami-

devotees observe a thirty-one-day  retreat after the  birth 
or  death of a  family member, not entering  temples or home  shrines, not 
attending  pûjâ  or religious events, but continuing their japa,  study and 
meditations. Aum.” The mission house is also closed during the monthly 
retreat of a woman of the household or if anyone in the household has 
in juries that are in the process of healing (*make sure numbering is still 
accurate) (see paragraph 312-313). If the mission house is closed on the day of the monthly havana,  then the satsa˜ga is convened at another family 
home that meets the above qualifications of a mission house. The mission house is also closed if the family is hosting guests who are not Church 
members. 
Bhashya from Bodhinatha, March 9, 2005
“ After the missions experienced several years of difficulty in finding 
suitable satsa˜ga  locations due to women being on retreat, Gurudeva 
verbally amended the above rule after communicating with the mis-
sion COMs about the subject. He decided that mission satsa˜gas  can 
be held in ßishya  homes where the wife or daughter is on month-
ly retreat, and also that other women on retreat can still come to 
satsa˜ga . The women on retreat would simply stay in another room 
during the initial pûjâ , and then return for the meditation, study 
period, cultural activities, announcements and prasâda . Of course, 
these activities would not be held in the shrine room. The women 
would not participate in making prasâda  for the satsa˜ga . If the satg-
uru and/or monks are present at the satsa˜ga , the women on retreat 
do not come forward to talk with them or touch their feet.”

NurtureService377 ¶Religious service is of two general forms: nurture

ship. Below are listed some of the many kinds of nurture activities  in our 
Church missions internationally.
1.  Weekly satsa˜ga at the mission house, monastic facility or local public 
temples, including arranging for flowers, garlands, decorations, prasâda, 
bhajana singing, religious entertainment and scriptural readings. 
2.  Helping with the maintenance of temples and monasteries in the local 
area through karma yoga projects, such as cleaning, mowing or gardening, 
needs best discerned by consulting the management.  
3.  Providing for social events and activities such as picnics, field trips, 
youth retreats, group outings, sewing circles, hiking, skating, family nights, 
breakfast gatherings and noncompetitive sports and games for youth and 
adult members. 
4.  Helping with cultural functions and festivals; preparing prasâda , mak-
ing decorations, and helping with coordinations.

design, garland making and cooking, bhajana and Natchintanai singing, 
and hosting of guest teachers and lecturers.  
6.  Hosting guests , treating each visitor as God, attending to them careful-
ly and courteously to make their stay most enjoyable and uplifting. This 
includes receiving them, arranging for accommodations, caring for them 
during their stay and seeing them off when they leave.

Since perverse considerations—such as injuries, whether done or 
caused to be done or approved, whether ensuing upon greed or anger or infatuation, whether mild or moderate or vehement—find their 
unending consequences in pain and in lack of thinking, 
there should be the cultivation of their opposites.

OutreachService 378 ¶“Outreach” consists of serving Hindus outside the 
immediate membership. It brings new members to the 
Church by encouraging eager souls to begin studying The 
Master Course. T ogether, nurture and outreach nourish the great banyan 
tree of dharma, which spreads out in all directions. Nurture feeds the 
roots, the trunk and its branches. Outreach draws in the sun’s rays to give

a great tree, ever spreading, ever fulfilling an ever greater service as the

things that we can do to help others, the Asian way is to not interfere 
in anyone’s karmic pattern unless their door is open. This firm, wisdom 
principle is given to all who follow our paramparâ and wish to perform 
religious service for others. Below are listed some of the many kinds of 
outreach activities our Church missions engage in.

reading scriptures to the elderly or handicapped.
2.  Arranging for the airing of tape recordings, videos and CD’s sent from 
Kauai Aadheenam for this purpose,

About the
FollowingChapter379 ¶In the chapter that follows we go into the internal 
administration of a mission, made up of heads of extend-ed families . As in any group effort, planning is needed for 
activities to be successful. The next chapter explains this in some detail. 
Since perverse considerations—such as injuries, whether done or 
caused to be done or approved, whether ensuing upon greed or anger or infatuation, whether mild or moderate or vehement—find their 
unending consequences in pain and in lack of thinking, 
there should be the cultivation of their opposites.
Patañjali’s Yoga Sûtras 2.34, SP p. 183
7.  Helping to arrange marriages, including determining compatibility, a 
responsibility held primarily by our kulapatis  and kulamâtâs.

Types of
OutreachService 378 ¶“Outreach” consists of serving Hindus outside the 
immediate membership. It brings new members to the 
Church by encouraging eager souls to begin studying The 
Master Course. T ogether, nurture and outreach nourish the great banyan 
tree of dharma, which spreads out in all directions. Nurture feeds the 
roots, the trunk and its branches. Outreach draws in the sun’s rays to give 
energy through the leaves, allowing the growth of new branches, a stron-
ger trunk and deeper roots. Thus, our religious service is the life force of 
a great tree, ever spreading, ever fulfilling an ever greater service as the 
years go by. It must be remembered, however, that while there are many 
things that we can do to help others, the Asian way is to not interfere

latecomers are allowed entry to the room until the preshana chakravâla 
has been concluded. Now the chakravâla has been formed, and the pro-
cess of communion between the inner and outer worlds has begun. The 
talaivar chants aum three times, and all chant together the Íânti Mantra, 
“Saha nâvavatu saha nau bhunaktu, saha vîrya˜ karavâvahai, tejasvinâv 
adhîtamastu, mâ vidvishâvahai. Aum ßânti˙, ßânti˙, ßânti˙.” Then they 
sit for a few minutes in meditation, spinning the prâ∫as of the chakravâ-
la clockwise, building the vibration, holding the ßakti, then moving the 
prâ∫as around the circle clockwise again, building a cone of energy reach-
ing up two feet above the head of the tallest among them into the inner 
worlds. Then the talaivar Aums three times. He proceeds with the agenda 
point by point, noting responses on his agenda throughout the meeting, for he sends this agenda to the Pî†ham when the meeting concludes.
2. The talaivar sits, humble, smiling and content. He never comments on 
what he hears. He takes it all into himself on his mental conveyor belt to 
the Guru Mahâsannidhânam . First, after opening his calendar, he turns 
to the pechâlar and asks for a report of duties he had been given during 
the previous meeting. The talaivar absorbs like a great sponge all that the 
pechâlar has to say. On his meeting agenda he makes notes of important 
points for his next communication with the Pî†ham .
3. He refrains from comment, but is free with praise, for what he is hear-
ing from the pechâlar is past and has already been done. No corrections 
can be made. He knows in his wisdom that corrections are made in setting 
new directions, and this he will do in the future, not today.
4.  The talaivar then turns his attention to the “silent devas” (the sabaiyor) 
and the total group. He asks about the duties of the agencies and the mis-
sion as a whole and how well these duties are being fulfilled. He inquires 
how the worship and karma yoga  are proceeding, how the satsa˜gas are 
being attended, and any problems or needs that may persist. He takes it 
all in, absorbs it like a sponge. No aspect of his mind does he allow to be disturbed by what he hears or what they say they have seen. He takes it all 
in, making memos on his agenda that someone has neglected this sâdhana 
or that sûtra , or that something has been done very well.
5.  The talaivar then asks the whole group, “Is anyone standing out, being 
less than transparent, or deserving a note of praise , in our mission or 
in any other of our missions in the country or the world?” By this he

SeniorityStructure381 ¶The preshana chakravâla  is organized according 
to the traditional chakravâla sa˜ga system.  The senior 
kulapati  present serves as the talaivar: Guru Mahâsannid-
hânam’s scribe. All others sit to his left around the circle. The next senior 
is the pechâlar, Guru Mahâsannidhânam’s spokesman to groups. T o the left 
of the pechâlar is the padipâlar, the priest and assistant to the pechâlar.  To  
his left is the  sabaiyor(s), silent assembly person(s). The last person in the 
circle, the youngest in seniority, sitting to the right of the talaivar, is the 
tûtuvar, the Guru Mahâsannidhânam’s messenger to individuals.  
Council 
MeetingProtocol382 ¶Informal meetings of kulapatis may also be held as 
needed. These follow a different structure described later 
in this chapter. But  the preshana chakravâla meetings are 
formal and follow a pattern similar to that outlined in the Íaivite Íâstras 
for the ma†havâsi senior minority groups within our monasteries which 
has been successfully followed for the last 23 years. This is the way, inner-
plane masters explain, that meetings of this type are held in the Devaloka, 
and they want us to do the same on Earth. The flow, adapted for our mis-
sions, is summarized below. The devonic helpers who wrote our Íaivite 
Íâstras visualized and described these meetings as a divine play taking 
place within the Devaloka, a gathering of individuals who by merely sit-
ting together help stabilize the vibration of the surrounding community, 
so in tune are these sublime beings with their higher energies. The devas, 
therefore, gave special names to each character in the divine play of the 
chakravâla gathered to gently guide the flow of events in a monastery and 
maintain the vigil of sublimity as Íaivism emerges in the Golden Age. In 
the monastery, the talaivar in this special circle is called Umâga∫eßa, for 
he is the guru’s scribe, sitting quietly, smilingly, in the eternity of the Now. 
The pechâlar is called Hanumân . The padipâlar  is called Bâlahanumân, or 
assistant Hanumân. The tûtuvar  is named Umâdeva. These terms are not 
used in the missions, though the roles are parallel.

matter is dropped for now and all strongly spin the prâ∫a ßakti. This same 
remedy is applied any time discussion persists into worldliness, which is 
lowering the vibration through argument, contention and hard feelings. 
Then, in sixty seconds of silence or a minute more, the talaivar begins to 
speak again and relate the divine knowledge from his communication 
with the Guru Mahâsannidhânam as to innovations, suggestions, correc-
tions and disciplines to keep the Íaivite mission and the mission of the 
mission stable and progressive.
10. When he has completed giving his instructions to his helpers, the talai-
var says to all, “Feel the power of Íiva’s ßakti now. He must be here in fact. 
Let’s entertain Him in our silence.” When the time is just right, the talai-
var asks the padipâlar to lead the group in chanting Aum and the Íânti 
Mantra. Then, in order of seniority, all come forward to the padi pâlar for 
a pinch of vibhûti, which he places in their right hand.  Everyone leaves the 
room except the talaivar .
11. After everyone has departed, the talaivar sits alone and meditates 
awhile upon the scene he has absorbed into himself. He reflects to find 
whether he has spoken out of line and, thus, in doing so failing to absorb 
and missing a point or two. And while it is all fresh within his mind, he organizes his calendar and completes his notes on his agenda in prepara-
tion for his next communication with the Kailâsa Pî†ham. 
Contact
With thePî†ham384 ¶ 1. At some time before every council on missions 
meeting, the talaivar will seek for a communication with 
the Pî†ham for direction. If he has not received counsel 
before the next meeting, naturally he cannot tell of his communication. 
He just takes in what is said by those present to later present in the next 
communication. Otherwise, the meeting is conducted as usual.
2. When the talaivar communicates with the Pî†ham, he presents clearly 
and conc isely, poin t by point, everything he needs answers to or advice in, 
quickly noting any immediate response from the swâmî. 
3.  In a typical communication between the talaivar and the Pî†ham, be it 
in person, by telephone or electronic mail, the talaivar presents everything 
in the same way the council presented it to him at the council meeting . 
4.  Innovations given by the Pî†ham do not need a nod of approval from 
the council on missions, only a nod as to the time they should occur. It is the talaivar who should pick the most  auspicious time, so that they will go 
into effect smoothly through the council, and if the time has been chosen 
One step for strength, 
two steps for vitality, three steps for prosper-ity, four steps for happiness, five steps for cattle, six steps for seasons, seven steps for friendship. T o me be devoted.

1.6.21.2. VE, 263means are there any problems that the Íivaguru and the kulapatis  should 
know about in the behavior and conduct of any of the ßishyas. Anyone in 
the chakravâla may speak up and mention one or two. Again the talaivar 
takes it all in and records it on his agenda, making no comment. Smilingly 
he keeps the prâ∫as flowing around the circle from one to another.
6.  He then asks the tûtuvar the results of any assignments he had been 
given to perform. The tûtuvar speaks, and again the talaivar takes it all in, 
jotting down a thing or two.
7. The talaivar then turns to the pechâlar and asks, “What guests are com-
ing and what guests have come and gone?” The pechâlar responds with 
current information of successes and problems, wishes, wants and needs. 
The talaivar again takes it all in, making careful memos on his agenda. 
8.  He then asks if there are any innovations  or projects which anyone 
has collected for presentation to the Pî†ham . This includes reports of ongo-
ing projects.  He notes each one in his great agenda to convey in his next 
divine communication. He asks if the Guru Mahâsannidhânam has given any assignments for mission activities to any of the kulapatis or anyone 
in their families. The talaivar makes no comment, but takes careful note 
of each item to later present for the Guru’s review and implementation 
through the council on missions. In this way, the Guru can speak freely 
and give ideas to one and all, knowing that each idea will be later brought 
to him in a formal way by his humble scribe, the talaivar. The talaivar 
refrains from offering any input from himself at this time, but saves it to review with the Pî†ham during his next communication. 
9. Then the talaivar says to all, “Feel the great power of ßakti that is now 
coming to us from Íiva’s Kailâsa Pî†ham.” All sit in silence, spinning the 
prâ∫a clockwise around the chakravâla. And after four or five minutes, 
when the ßakti prâ∫a reaches its peak, the talaivar begins to speak smil-
ingly, “Deep within myself I sat at Íiva’s feet and he helped me rearrange 
my calendar and agenda. This is what he had to say.” The talaivar then 
states the gist of the conversation or electronic or other kind of commu-
nication  that he had with the Guru or his representative at Kauai Aad-
heenam. Then he tells the Guru’s instructions for the pechâlar and tûtuvar 
and answers any questions they may have in clarification of the instruc-
tions. The pechâlar delivers messages to groups within the mission. The 
tûtuvar conveys messages to individuals. If any instruction to the pechâlar 
or tûtuvar is not clear and there is a back and forth of more than a time or 
two or three, the talaivar in his wisdom smiles and writes on his agenda

a pinch of vibhûti, which he places in their right hand.  Everyone leaves the 
room except the talaivar .
11. After everyone has departed, the talaivar sits alone and meditates 
awhile upon the scene he has absorbed into himself. He reflects to find 
whether he has spoken out of line and, thus, in doing so failing to absorb 
and missing a point or two. And while it is all fresh within his mind, he organizes his calendar and completes his notes on his agenda in prepara-
tion for his next communication with the Kailâsa Pî†ham. 
Contact
With thePî†ham384 ¶ 1. At some time before every council on missions 
meeting, the talaivar will seek for a communication with 
the Pî†ham for direction. If he has not received counsel 
before the next meeting, naturally he cannot tell of his communication. 
He just takes in what is said by those present to later present in the next 
communication. Otherwise, the meeting is conducted as usual.
2. When the talaivar communicates with the Pî†ham, he presents clearly 
and conc isely, poin t by point, everything he needs answers to or advice in, 
quickly noting any immediate response from the swâmî. 
3.  In a typical communication between the talaivar and the Pî†ham, be it 
in person, by telephone or electronic mail, the talaivar presents everything 
in the same way the council presented it to him at the council meeting . 
4.  Innovations given by the Pî†ham do not need a nod of approval from 
the council on missions, only a nod as to the time they should occur. It is the talaivar who should pick the most  auspicious time, so that they will go 
into effect smoothly through the council, and if the time has been chosen 
One step for strength, 
two steps for vitality, three steps for prosper-ity, four steps for happiness, five steps for cattle, six steps for seasons, seven steps for friendship. T o me be devoted.
HIRAIY AKEÍI G‰IHY A S¨TRAS 
1.6.21.2. VE, 263means are there any problems that the Íivaguru and the kulapatis  should 
know about in the behavior and conduct of any of the ßishyas. Anyone in 
the chakravâla may speak up and mention one or two. Again the talaivar 
takes it all in and records it on his agenda, making no comment. Smilingly 
he keeps the prâ∫as flowing around the circle from one to another.
6.  He then asks the tûtuvar the results of any assignments he had been 
given to perform. The tûtuvar speaks, and again the talaivar takes it all in, 
jotting down a thing or two.
7. The talaivar then turns to the pechâlar and asks, “What guests are com-
ing and what guests have come and gone?” The pechâlar responds with 
current information of successes and problems, wishes, wants and needs. 
The talaivar again takes it all in, making careful memos on his agenda. 
8.  He then asks if there are any innovations  or projects which anyone 
has collected for presentation to the Pî†ham . This includes reports of ongo-
ing projects.  He notes each one in his great agenda to convey in his next 
divine communication. He asks if the Guru Mahâsannidhânam has given any assignments for mission activities to any of the kulapatis or anyone 
in their families. The talaivar makes no comment, but takes careful note 
of each item to later present for the Guru’s review and implementation 
through the council on missions. In this way, the Guru can speak freely 
and give ideas to one and all, knowing that each idea will be later brought 
to him in a formal way by his humble scribe, the talaivar. The talaivar 
refrains from offering any input from himself at this time, but saves it to review with the Pî†ham during his next communication. 
9. Then the talaivar says to all, “Feel the great power of ßakti that is now 
coming to us from Íiva’s Kailâsa Pî†ham.” All sit in silence, spinning the 
prâ∫a clockwise around the chakravâla. And after four or five minutes, 
when the ßakti prâ∫a reaches its peak, the talaivar begins to speak smil-
ingly, “Deep within myself I sat at Íiva’s feet and he helped me rearrange 
my calendar and agenda. This is what he had to say.” The talaivar then 
states the gist of the conversation or electronic or other kind of commu-
nication  that he had with the Guru or his representative at Kauai Aad-
heenam. Then he tells the Guru’s instructions for the pechâlar and tûtuvar 
and answers any questions they may have in clarification of the instruc-
tions. The pechâlar delivers messages to groups within the mission. The 
tûtuvar conveys messages to individuals. If any instruction to the pechâlar 
or tûtuvar is not clear and there is a back and forth of more than a time or 
two or three, the talaivar in his wisdom smiles and writes on his agenda

Missionscorrectly initially, everyone should nod. If they do not nod, the talaivar 
should choose another time to present the matter again. In this way, dis-
cussion is avoided during the meetings, which inhibits the polarization of 
ßakti, making the ßakti less strong. 
5. After the communication with the Pî†ham, the talaivar sits alone and, 
while everything is all fresh in his mind, organizes what he will present 
to the council on missions at the next meeting . This should not take much 
longer than ten minutes and can be done in five.
6. All occurrences between a talaivar or pechâlar or anyone in the coun-
cil on missions is strictly guarded as confidential. Even years later, they 
must hold their confidences as to all happenings, information and discus-
sions that come to them or before them while participating with their guru 
in the council on missions. This remedy, well heeded, will prevent toil and 
turmoil in subconscious strife in years to come in each Íaivite mission.
Notes of 
Praise or Correction385 ¶Messages to individuals or groups from the council 
on missions, with the blessings of the Pî†ham, are given 
with great care and humility. In this way, as in ancient 
days, discipline, correction and training is given systematically and with 
great courtesy and care. Each time a cor rection is given, an apology pre-
cedes it, such as, “Pardon,” or “Forgive me, for I have something to convey.” 
Praise, of course, is given freely and abundantly. 
Council 
MeetingReports386 ¶After every council on missions meeting, the talai-
var must report to the Pî†ham, telling of the outcome of 
the meeting, listing the names of those who attended and 
those who were absent. As the Aadheenam depends on its kulapatis to be 
responsive, it refrains from taking too many steps to make manifest mis-
sion service and activities. All, therefore, heed the following policy: if no 
reports on mission meetings are received from the talaivar for a period 
of three months, the Pî†ham will declare the mission closed and disallow 
further gatherings. The mission may be reopened with special ceremony 
upon request from the members. 
Other
KulapatiChakravâlas 387 ¶The rigid guidelines given above only apply to the 
preshana chakravâla, the official administrative meeting 
of each mission. Naturally, kulapatis will gather at other 
times as needed to discuss matters of concern. Kulapatis from other mis-
sions may be present at such gatherings as well, and the format of those 
meetings is casual. The eldest present according to seniority, as talaivar, 
conducts the meeting. Others fulfill the roles of pechâlar, padipâlar, tûtu-

In SmallMissions388 Duties may adjust when members are few. If the pre-
shana chakravâla of a mission that has only three kulapa-
tis, these three are talaivar, pechâlar and tûtuvar . If two 
kulapatis  form a council, one is talaivar and the other is both pechâlar 
and tûtuvar . In a mission of only one kulapati family, the kulapati is talai-
var, pechâlar and tûtuvar all in one.
National
KulapatiMeetings389 ¶All the kulapatis in a given country meet together 
three times a year at the beginning of each season—in 
mid-April, mid-August and mid-December. Each such 
group is called a national council of patriarchs, or desha chakravâla.  Their 
focus for meetings is to fulfill the spirit of the “three seasons”—Nartana 
‰itau, the season of Dancing with Íiva; Jîvana ‰itau, the season of Liv-
ing with Íiva; Moksha ‰itau, the season of Merging with Íiva. These mat-
ters are outlined clearly on the agenda prepared at the Aadheenam by the Ekadanta Kulam and provided each kulapati  at least one month in 
advance of the meetings. In planning activities, all kulapati groups refer 
to and seek to fulfill the guidelines within these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras 
for each season.  No final decisions are made at these conclaves. In many 
cases, the Pî†ham participates in the meeting directly on a telephonic conference call. After the sum total of what has been heard is meditated 
upon, divine insight comes from the Pî†ham. These conclusions are then 
conveyed by the Pî†ham to the talaivars of the local missions to be put into 
action. In summary, the national kulapati chakravâlas are information-
gathering groups. The seasonal meetings of the national kulapatis set the 
tenor for the local missions . They are not action groups. They do not carry 
out decisions. They do not keep “minutes” that are moved and seconded. It 
is the local missions, at monthly council on mission meetings that mani-
fest activities and report regularly to the Aadheenam.  
About the
FollowingChapter390 ¶It is said, among those who know of Indian spiri-
tuality, that after finding and following a satguru noth-
ing is more essential to inner progress than the constant 
company of good souls— satsa˜ga. Groups of Íiva’s devotees who have 
formed themselves into missions have a task to perform called sâdhana 
through satsa˜ga. The next chapter holds the outline of three such sâdha-
na satsa˜gas , gatherings that uplift and purify all who attend. These times 
of togetherness, when the group helps the individual and the individual 
helps the group, are serious, soul-rewarding weekly experiences .
That in which the 
prayers, the songs and formulas are fixed firm like spokes in the hub of a cartwheel,  in which are interwo-ven the hearts of all beings—may that spirit be graciously dis-posed toward me!

Gatheringsencouraged to find ways to strengthen the many families in the commu-
nity and to plan the schooling of children in the 64 kalâs and the first six 
books of Íaivite Hindu Religion for the coming year. 
1. Activities begin with Ga∫eßa âratî by the pâdipâlar of the day. He then 
leads the group in chanting the Gurudeva Namaskâra V eda Mantra. 
2. Then the pâdipâlar  conducts satguru pâdapûjâ . 
3. The pechâlar  of the day now leads the group in a thirty-minute guided 
meditation on the Íivachaitanya Pañchatantra .
4.  Next, as the teaching period for this four-month season stresses Danc-
ing with Íiva: Hinduism’s Contemporary Catechism, the central activity is 
praßnottara satsa˜ga : “gathering for questions and answers.” *The ques-
tions are those asked at the beginning of each ßloka of Dancing with Íiva. 
After the pûjâ, the group forms one or more chakra vâlas. All chant Aum 
together three times. The talaivar of each circle then asks the first ques-
tion of the person to his or her left. The devotee answers by reading the 
sûtra and bhâshya from the lesson itself. When a devotee knows more 
than one language, additional readings should be given in those languages. 
Then personal testimony is offered as to how the lesson has changed his 
or her life. After giving testimony, the devotee asks the second question of 
the next person in the circle to his or her left, and so on until everyone has 
had the opportunity to ask and answer one or more questions.  No philo-
sophical discussion  is permitted during praßnottara satsa˜ga except when 
a ma†havâsi is present. This portion of the gathering lasts 30 minutes. 
4a. Y early Planning: Inspiration is high and all are given a sheet of paper 
by the tûtuvar as the pechâlar invites everyone, on the satguru’s behalf, to 
write out plans for the  year ahead. They do this by intuitively reading the 
âkâßa and writing down what quickly comes to mind. These papers are 
saved by each individual. This part of the satsa˜ga lasts about 15 minutes. 
At the last satsa˜ga of the ®itau  all the good foresights are compiled by 
each into one comprehensive program for the year . This plan is kept as a 
personal diary and not shared with anyone else. 
5.  Announcements are then given by the pechâlar, focusing on the imple-
mentation of the goals of this ®itau, the areas of emphasis indicated for the

Satsa˜gaGuidelines394 ¶ Below is an overview, in seven steps, of the way 
satsa˜ga is conducted. It is followed by the outline of activ-
ities for each of the three seasons. 
1.  After all members have gathered and greeted one another, Ga∫eßa âratî 
is performed by the padipâlar of the day. He then leads the group in chant-
ing the Gurudeva Namaskâra V eda Mantra . 
2. Then the padipâlar performs pâdapûjâ  to the satguru’s  tiruvadi, holy 
sandals, to invoke the presence of God, Gods, guru and the devas. This 
pûjâ is performed ac cording to the Íaiva Åtmârtha liturgy, with Sansk®it 
mantras  chanted aloud rather performed in silence. All join in chanting 
the Gurudeva Ash†ottara Shatanâmavali, 108 names, at the point in the 
pûjâ when the names of the Deity are normally chanted. After the âratî, 
sacraments (tîrtha, vibhûti, chandana, ku˜kuma,  etc.,) are given out by the 
pujârî. The Ga∫eßa âratî and pâdapûjâ together last about 45 minutes. 
3. The pâdapûjâ is followed by a period of meditation, lasting 30 minutes, 
conducted by the pechâlar  of the day. The subject changes with the season.
4. Then there is a 45-minute study period, guided by the talaivar of the day. 
Everyone sits in a chakravâla.
5. Next follows a 30-minute period of cultural activities.
6. Announcements are then given by the pechâlar (about 5 minutes). 
7. Prasâda, perhaps a full rice and curry meal, is then enjoyed. During 
the first ®itau,  it is suggested that prasâda  include yogurt rice, sundal and 
kesari; during the second ®itau, tamarind rice, aval and modakas; in the 
third ®itau, sweet rice, vadai and pâyasam. 
Nartana
‰itau BhajanaSatsa˜ga395 ¶Nartana Satsa˜ga is held from mid-April through 
mid-August. Whenever a satsa˜ga gathers, a chakravâla is 
created. Nartana ‰itau is the time of year when those in 
the g®ihastha âßrama  are honored, and we can optionally bring garlands 
to express our love and support of kulapatis and kulamâtâs in this âßrama  
of life. All pay close attention to their testimony on raising children, deal-
ing with family problems, keeping harmony in the home and fulfilling the 
duties of g®ihastha dharma . Informal meetings and discussion groups are

nity and to plan the schooling of children in the 64 kalâs and the first six 
books of Íaivite Hindu Religion for the coming year. 
1. Activities begin with Ga∫eßa âratî by the pâdipâlar of the day. He then 
leads the group in chanting the Gurudeva Namaskâra V eda Mantra. 
2. Then the pâdipâlar  conducts satguru pâdapûjâ . 
3. The pechâlar  of the day now leads the group in a thirty-minute guided 
meditation on the Íivachaitanya Pañchatantra .
4.  Next, as the teaching period for this four-month season stresses Danc-
ing with Íiva: Hinduism’s Contemporary Catechism, the central activity is 
praßnottara satsa˜ga : “gathering for questions and answers.” *The ques-
tions are those asked at the beginning of each ßloka of Dancing with Íiva. 
After the pûjâ, the group forms one or more chakra vâlas. All chant Aum 
together three times. The talaivar of each circle then asks the first ques-
tion of the person to his or her left. The devotee answers by reading the 
sûtra and bhâshya from the lesson itself. When a devotee knows more 
than one language, additional readings should be given in those languages. 
Then personal testimony is offered as to how the lesson has changed his 
or her life. After giving testimony, the devotee asks the second question of 
the next person in the circle to his or her left, and so on until everyone has 
had the opportunity to ask and answer one or more questions.  No philo-
sophical discussion  is permitted during praßnottara satsa˜ga except when 
a ma†havâsi is present. This portion of the gathering lasts 30 minutes. 
4a. Y early Planning: Inspiration is high and all are given a sheet of paper 
by the tûtuvar as the pechâlar invites everyone, on the satguru’s behalf, to 
write out plans for the  year ahead. They do this by intuitively reading the 
âkâßa and writing down what quickly comes to mind. These papers are 
saved by each individual. This part of the satsa˜ga lasts about 15 minutes. 
At the last satsa˜ga of the ®itau  all the good foresights are compiled by 
each into one comprehensive program for the year . This plan is kept as a 
personal diary and not shared with anyone else. 
5.  Announcements are then given by the pechâlar, focusing on the imple-
mentation of the goals of this ®itau, the areas of emphasis indicated for the 
season. 
6. Next is a 30-minute time for cultural events, videos, recordings, singing 
Natchintanai, dancing, seminars and classes on the myriad cultural arts.

mid-April. This is the season when those in the sannyâsa 
âßrama  are especially honored. All turn their attention to 
those special g®ihasthas in life’s fourth stage, and to the sannyâsins of our 
order, who have renounced the world to follow the path to moksha and Self 
Realization. We listen to their insights, to their yogic revelations and their 
sweet encouragements. When possible, we invite them to our satsa˜ga so 
we may enjoy their presence and their words, and we prepare special gar-
lands to show our admiration for their courage and commitment, their 
example of detachment and inwardness as exemplary members of the 
sannyâsa dharma . If no exemplars of this âßrama are present, the eldest 
vâ∫aprasthas take their place in extolling the merits of this stage of life, 
reading from the Holy Orders  which express all of the renunciate ideals 
and the need for young men to qualify themselves as ma†havâsis . This is a 
time when the families talk about and plan the future of any young men 
who may be potential monks and arrange for their training. It is also a 
time to think of the future of any family persons approaching age 72, to 
determine how and where they will live out the fourth stage of life. 
1. Activities begin with Ga∫eßa âratî by the pâdipâlar of the day. He then

Íiva: Hinduism’s Contemporary Metaphysics.  Therefore, everyone enjoys a 
30-minute meditation on the Shum mamsane  guided by the pechâlar. One 
of the twelve mamsane is the subject of meditation each week. Soft vî∫â

special gifts of knowledge and experience that are the legacy of our elders 
in the community. We listen to their vision, their high-minded work in 
the broader community in guiding the dharma within the broader social 
and spiritual and political arenas. We encourage garlands to be brought 
to these satsa˜gas, then offered with words of kindness and respect to 
those who have been through so much and who now have an awakening 
wisdom by which all within the Church can be guided along the right 
path by those among us who have grown naturally into the subtle duties 
of vâ∫aprastha dharma .

3. Sûtra Meditation : The teaching period for this four-month season empha-
sizes Living with Íiva: Hinduism’s Contemporary Culture.  This is the time 
when we ignite the fire of progress among this holy band. The goal is to 
strengthen each member’s commitment to upholding all the vowed sûtras 
for the coming year in public and private life and all sâdhanas they have 
been given to perform. Therefore, a thirty-minute meditation is held, guid-
ed by the pechâlar, on the meaning of vrata and the need for prâyaßchitta 
or penance  when a vrata is not upheld. The Nandinâtha sûtras should all 
be in front of each devotee in written or printed form. During the med-
itative, reflective period, each one writes down on paper any sûtras or 
neglected sâdhanas they need to strengthen their commitment to fulfill. 
A positive plan for perfection is made, first through inner commitment 
and then actual change. These papers are kept by the devotee and looked at each night before sleep. They are finally burned in a full-moon havana 
when all penances have been completed and guilt has disappeared. This 
tantra demonstrates that each one is responsible to himself for applied 
metaphysical practices and consciously recuperating sâdhanas that were 
neglected along life’s pathway. This is the Nâtha way of self effort to attain 
Self Realization.
 
4. Sûtra Discussion : After the meditation, the group forms one or more 
chakravâlas for sûtra discussion, with men and women separate. This con-
stitutes the 45-minute study period. A full disclosure is made by each one 
to all others as to how well he or she has been living up to the Nandinâtha

Satsa˜gaGuidelines399 ¶ 1. Activities begin with Ga∫eßa âratî by the pâdipâ-
lar of the day. He then leads the group in chanting the 
Gurudeva Namaskâra V eda Mantra as everyone takes 
their seat . Kulapatis sit on the four sides of the havana, in order of senior-
ity, with the talaivar facing south. Everyone else sits around them in a 
chakravâla, as close to the havana ku∫∂a as possible. 
2. The talaivar, the senior kulapati present, welcomes everyone and presents 
a greeting from the satguru or gives a short reading from his teachings . 
3. The pechâlar then leads in Natchintanai singing , first with a song to 
Lord Ga∫eßa, then to Lord Murugan, then to Supreme God Íiva. 
4. When the Natchintanai to God Íiva is begun, the tûtuvar ceremoni-
ously hands a flame to the talaivar who then lights the homa fire.
5. The Pañchâkshara bhajana , “ Aum Nama˙ Íivâya,” is then sung by all.
6. The four kulapatis join together in placing sacred woods, ghee, grains 
and other precious sacrifices into the fire. 
7. When the prâ∫ic vibration builds up enough for all to feel the inner 
doors of the Devaloka open, the pechâlar  leads the group in chanting the 
mantra “ Aum, Hâm, Haum, Íivâyanama Svâhâ”  108 times in unison.  
8. Meanwhile, the written prayers to the devas are slowly placed in the 
sacred fire by the talaivar while the tûtuvar rings a small bell which 
attracts the devas’ close attention. The fire releases the prayers to their 
astral form. Singing and chanting creates enough odic and actinic force 
to hold open the connection between the inner and outer worlds, to enable the devas to receive the astral duplicate of the written prayers. 
9. Prayers may be written during the havana or at home in anticipation 
of the event. It is the guardian devas of all present and the devas from near-
by temples and home shrines that come to the mission house, having been 
attracted by the havana and the ringing of the bell.  
10. After the prayers have been burned and “ Aum, Hâm, Haum, Íivâ yanama 
Svâhâ” has been chanted 108 times, all sit in silent meditation, internal-
izing their worship, for at least ten minutes, listening to the nâdanâ∂î ßakti, 
looking at the jyoti,  absorbed in Íiva consciousness. The pechâlar signals 
The Lord, God, 
all-pervading and omnipresent, dwells in the heart of all beings. Full of grace, He ulti-mately gives liberation to all creatures by turning their faces toward Himself.

4. Vâsanâ Daha Tantra : After the meditation, everyone writes confessions 
on paper to clear the subconscious mind of unwanted vâsanâs. The con-
fessions are then burned in an unauspicious fire, such as a fireplace or 
trash can. They are not burned in the havana  or temple because they are 
not being written as prayers to the devas. Next is the time for giving tes-
timony as to how confession, repentance and reconciliation have helped 
in clearing unwanted vâsanâs that have accumulated in the subconscious 
and sub-subconscious areas of the mind during the year. However, this does not require revealing the details of one’s actual confessions. The writ-
ing of confessions and giving of testimony constitute the 45 minute study 
period.
5.  Announcements are then given by the pechâlar, focusing on the goals 
of this ®itau, the areas of emphasis indicated for the season. 
6. Next is a 30-minute time for cultural events, videos, recordings, singing 
Natchintanai, dancing, seminars and classes on the myriad cultural arts, 
including the 64 kalâs.  
7.  The satsa˜ga concludes with a 30-minute period of socializing and shar-

Full-Moon 
HavanaSatsa˜ga 398 ¶Once a month only at full-moon time, when four 
or more kulapatis are present from the local mission or 
from other missions , the gathering takes on a different for-
mat: that of the havana satsa˜ga. If there are not four qualified kulapatis, 
the full-moon gathering takes on the form of bhajana satsa˜ga. Havana is 
the sacred ritual of offering sacrificial oblations to the Gods and perform-
ing lekhaprârtha yajña, burning written prayers to the Devaloka through 
a most sacred fire. Havana satsa˜ga is held at a monastery, the mission 
house or at another family home that meets mission-house standards if 
the mission house is closed because of a retreat. The havana ku∫∂a, fire 
altar,  can be made of metal or brick, and the fire should be kept small so 
that smoke does not harm the room.  Kulapatis must be sitting at all four 
sides of the havana to contain and balance the spiritual energies. In this 
eminent duty, they are called havanakâras. The havana is performed by 
the three most senior kulapatis and the least senior kulapati present at the 
appointed time. If four kulapatis are not present, the havana cannot be 
held, and the bhajana satsa˜ga of the season is then commenced. When a 
mission has blessings to hold satsa˜ga at a monastery, the pâdapûjâ and 
havana are conducted by kulapatis rather than by monastics. Any monks

sacred fire by the talaivar while the tûtuvar rings a small bell which 
attracts the devas’ close attention. The fire releases the prayers to their 
astral form. Singing and chanting creates enough odic and actinic force 
to hold open the connection between the inner and outer worlds, to enable the devas to receive the astral duplicate of the written prayers. 
9. Prayers may be written during the havana or at home in anticipation 
of the event. It is the guardian devas of all present and the devas from near-
by temples and home shrines that come to the mission house, having been 
attracted by the havana and the ringing of the bell.  
10. After the prayers have been burned and “ Aum, Hâm, Haum, Íivâ yanama 
Svâhâ” has been chanted 108 times, all sit in silent meditation, internal-
izing their worship, for at least ten minutes, listening to the nâdanâ∂î ßakti, 
looking at the jyoti,  absorbed in Íiva consciousness. The pechâlar signals 
The Lord, God, 
all-pervading and omnipresent, dwells in the heart of all beings. Full of grace, He ulti-mately gives liberation to all creatures by turning their faces toward Himself.

4. Vâsanâ Daha Tantra : After the meditation, everyone writes confessions 
on paper to clear the subconscious mind of unwanted vâsanâs. The con-
fessions are then burned in an unauspicious fire, such as a fireplace or 
trash can. They are not burned in the havana  or temple because they are 
not being written as prayers to the devas. Next is the time for giving tes-
timony as to how confession, repentance and reconciliation have helped 
in clearing unwanted vâsanâs that have accumulated in the subconscious 
and sub-subconscious areas of the mind during the year. However, this does not require revealing the details of one’s actual confessions. The writ-
ing of confessions and giving of testimony constitute the 45 minute study 
period.
5.  Announcements are then given by the pechâlar, focusing on the goals 
of this ®itau, the areas of emphasis indicated for the season. 
6. Next is a 30-minute time for cultural events, videos, recordings, singing 
Natchintanai, dancing, seminars and classes on the myriad cultural arts, 
including the 64 kalâs.  
7.  The satsa˜ga concludes with a 30-minute period of socializing and shar-
ing prasâda .
Full-Moon 
HavanaSatsa˜ga 398 ¶Once a month only at full-moon time, when four 
or more kulapatis are present from the local mission or 
from other missions , the gathering takes on a different for-
mat: that of the havana satsa˜ga. If there are not four qualified kulapatis, 
the full-moon gathering takes on the form of bhajana satsa˜ga. Havana is 
the sacred ritual of offering sacrificial oblations to the Gods and perform-
ing lekhaprârtha yajña, burning written prayers to the Devaloka through 
a most sacred fire. Havana satsa˜ga is held at a monastery, the mission 
house or at another family home that meets mission-house standards if 
the mission house is closed because of a retreat. The havana ku∫∂a, fire 
altar,  can be made of metal or brick, and the fire should be kept small so 
that smoke does not harm the room.  Kulapatis must be sitting at all four 
sides of the havana to contain and balance the spiritual energies. In this 
eminent duty, they are called havanakâras. The havana is performed by 
the three most senior kulapatis and the least senior kulapati present at the 
appointed time. If four kulapatis are not present, the havana cannot be 
held, and the bhajana satsa˜ga of the season is then commenced. When a 
mission has blessings to hold satsa˜ga at a monastery, the pâdapûjâ and 
havana are conducted by kulapatis rather than by monastics. Any monks

Where 
Prayers MayBe Burned403 ¶Prayers should only be burned in a sanctified 
havana ku∫∂a  in a pâtra g®iha  or in a monastery or tem-
ple for which a covenant has been made with the devas 
to receive written prayers  and fulfill them to the best of their ability. It 
is the presiding Guru Mahâsannidhânam on the Kailâsa Pî†ham at Kauai 
Aadheenam who makes each covenant as to the homes and temples where 
prayers may be safely sent into the Devaloka without asuric interference. 
It is important to reemphasize why it is that havanas may only be per-
formed when four kulapatis  are present in a strict, traditional, ßâkâhâra, 
vegetarian home where no meat, fish, fowl, shellfish or eggs are served to 
humans. Asuras are attracted to mânsâhâra (meat-eating) places. No one 
attending a havana would want these negative beings collecting up their 
prayers on the astral plane, then working against them by creating havoc 
and inharmonious conditions. The site of the havana ku∫∂a is cleaned 
and decorated in preparation for these sacred monthly gatherings. Prayers 
should not be burned on Narakaloka days . On Bhuloka days they should 
be burned only during the three-hour Devaloka period. Prayers written at 
havanas  during inauspicious periods are collected by the tûtuvar, placed 
in an envelope and mailed to Kauai Aadheenam for burning.
How Prayers
Are ReceivedIn the Devaloka404 ¶The priest or individual burning the prayer need 
only ring a small bell while the paper is burning. As soon as the paper turns to ashes, its prâ∫ic- astral duplicate is 
released from its physical counterpart and immediately appears in the Devaloka. The paper with the prayer written upon it is snatched out of the 
âkâßa by one of the devas hovering over the fire, alerted by the ringing of 
the bell that a prayer is on its way. The written prayer is read aloud by the

Prayers to 
The DevasAnd Gods 400 ¶In Sansk®it, offering prayers to the Mahâdevas and 
their devas and ga∫as at the holy fire, havana ku∫∂a, is 
called the lekha (written) prârthana (prayer) yajña (sacri-
fice). It is interesting to note that prayer is prârthana in Sansk®it, which is 
similar to the English. Prayers are only allowed to be sent into the Deva-
loka in a sanctified havana ku∫∂a  in a home that meets the standards of a 
mission house, or at an authorized temple. We refer to such a dwelling as 
pâtra g®iha, “worthy home.”
Prayers
Sent inAbsentia401 ¶Prayers from devotees who are unable to attend the 
monthly havana may be mailed, faxed or sent electronical-
ly to the host at the local mission house, to the Aa dheenam 
or a dharmaßâla for transmission into the Devaloka. Members who are 
part of other missions may freely attend the havana at any Church mis-
sion, or they may send or give their prayers to a mission  member to burn 
for them to the inner worlds. All prayers are considered confidential and 
are mailed in a sealed envelope, clearly marked “prayers to the devas.” 
They are never opened by the priests or read by anyone even when faxed 
(confidentiality is especially protected when written in Tyaf) but placed 
directly into the fire during the havana rite. No one should enclose cash or 
checks in the sealed envelope containing prayers, because envelopes are 
placed into the fire unopened.  
Instructions 
For WritingPrayers402 ¶Prayers can be written to obtain answers to per-
sonal questions, to request help for specific needs or solu-
tions to problems. Prayers may also be written on behalf of 
another person, for a group of people or to help clear up a situation within a group or community, even for solutions to national or world problems. 
For easy reading in the Devaloka, each prayer is written or typed in dark 
ink. Each word must be legible. One must not scribble, but write or print

Internal and
External Worship407 ¶Giving testimony  is also sharing the fact that inter-
nalizing worship through Shum meditations gives the 
strength and stability to face the external world, imper-
vious to even the most stressful circumstances. It brings the courage to 
become successful, wealthy, able to fulfill purusha and strî dharma. Inter-
nal meditation of the Nâtha kind makes you the center of the universe. It 
bestows a oneness with Íiva, an acquaintance with the eternity of the 
moment where no negative forces can touch you, no stress can drain you, no inharmonious condition can affect you. Y ou are centered. Y ou are the 
center of all. Y ou are the peacemaker. Y ou are the one who changes the 
forces of the world to peace, happiness and an everlasting life of tranquil-
ity. Peace, indeed! Such is the power of external worship followed by inter-
nal worship. Such is the power of Siddhânta and V edânta. Such is the power 
of the fullness of our Íaivite heritage. So say the ®ishis of our noble param-
parâ. T estimony is affirming that performing daily sâdhana actually brings 
about permanent changes in life and a greater peace of mind. It is testi-
fying that when prayers are sent into the Devaloka through the holy fire, 
they are really answered in wonderful ways.  When something good hap-
pens to you because of your prayers, it happens through Lord Íiva’s grace. 
How Personal 
TestimonyUplifts408 ¶Y our testimony will help others become strong in 
their faith. Their testimony will in turn strengthen your 
faith. Hearing oneself voice testimony about a boon 
received or a prayer answered not only strengthens one’s own faith but 
the faith of others as well. Y es, the hearing of one’s own voice giving testi-
mony is a very powerful force which bounces back into the subconscious mind, building the force of faith. It also impresses the subconscious mind 
of the listeners with positive new saμskâras, building up their faith as 
well. T o strengthen faith is a boon you can give to others. Be generous and 
lift the veils in their minds through testimony.

“Secret is sacred and sacred is secret .” Prophetic dreams, 
breakthroughs in meditation, psychic experiences, visions 
deva holding it, then given to one of the Mahâdevas or to the deva who can 
best fulfill the request.  
How Prayers
Are MysticallyFulfilled405 ¶Before taking action on a prayer, the Mahâdevas and 
devas look very carefully into the karmas of the devotee. 
This includes prârabdha karmas, the results of past actions 
brought into this birth to be resolved; and kriyamâna karmas , actions and 
resultant merit or demerit currently being made by the individual. There-fore, it is always best to write one or more alternatives that you would be 
satisfied with in each prayer rather than insisting on only one solution. 
This is because your initial request may not be possible to fulfill in your 
karmic pattern or, without your knowing, it may actually be the worst 
possible thing that could happen. In this case, a prayer would be answered 
with a nonanswer.  Therefore, it is wise to suggest two or more alternatives 
when making a request.  It is acceptable to make the same request several 
times. Every prayer received is answered in some way, however mysteri-
ously. Not one is neglected, ever. When the devas receive many prayers at 
the same time about the same subject, written by the same devotee or by 
several different devotees, they are truly alerted that action must be taken. 
Wouldn’t you be if you went to your post box and received letters from ten 
different people all on the same subject?  
The Value
Of Personal Testimony406 ¶T estimony  is an important activity for all missions. 
Within each Church member, faith must be kept vital and vibrantly alive in prayer to Lord Íiva, the Gods Ga∫eßa 
and Murugan and their devas, in the gurus of our paramparâ and in the 
ancestors of each family. Faith is revitalized by the sharing of personal 
testimonials whenever devotees come together in satsa˜ga. Hearing about 
prayers having been answered in the testimony of others truly strength-
ens the faith of everyone present. Thus, the giving of testimony is a very 
important part of each mission gathering. And don’t forget the children. 
They will strengthen the faith of everyone present when they give their 
testimony. They have a lot to share that would remain unheard forever 
unless it were brought out by asking them a few leading questions. T o give 
testimony is to bear witness that benefits in life have come through prayer. 
It is testifying that prayers are really answered and that praying really 
does work. It is testifying that going to the temple gives peace of mind, 
that Lord Íiva and His Mahâdevas and devas have changed our lives and 
do help us with our problems. T estimony is especially important these days because scientists, rationalists, materialists, existentialists, sceptics

Church Perspective
/;/;/;/;/;/;/;/;/; TTERING THE WORD CHURCH CALLS TO MIND A MULTI-FAC-
ETED, INTERNATIONALLY-ACCEPTED FORM OF RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATION. BUT IT IS RARELY USED IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH INDIAN SPIRITUALITY . IN FACT, OURS IS THE FIRST 
HINDU CHURCH ON EARTH. HERE WE EXPLAIN THIS KEY 
CONCEPT, DEFINING CHURCH AND SUMMARIZING ITS 
USE IN OUR MINISTRIES, WHILE OFFERING AN HISTORI-
CAL VIEW AND BRIEF INSIGHTS INTO CHURCH SERVICE.
411 ¶Religious service can also be understood through the Western con-
cept of ministry. The word minister  is both a verb and a noun, derived 
originally from the Latin word, ministrare meaning to supply; to provide; 
to give help to or to attend to needs. In modern use, as a noun, a minister 
is any person thought of as serving as the agent of some other power. In 
government, a prime minister is the chief agent of the people, whose duty 
it is to attend to their needs. There are also other kinds of ministers in 
government such as the minister of defense, the minister of home affairs, 
the minister of foreign affairs. Ministry in religion is similar to minis-try in government, for both attend to the needs of the people. These two 
ministries working together make for a strong society. The words minis-
try and minister  are descriptive terms applicable to all governments and 
to all religions. Ministry cannot be defined as a function belonging to 
one religion more than another. There are many religions today that have 
recognized that the modern church system is the vehicle for the religious 
work of the future. They have developed visible and sophisticated forms 
of ministry, carried out by ordained ministers and lay missionaries under 
their direction. In Íaiva Siddhânta Church, the ma†havâsi community are 
the ministers and the kulapati  community are the missionaries.
Church: an
Ideal VehicleOf Service412 ¶In this century many religions have adopted the 
word church to describe their worldwide organizations 
and local bodies. We can look in the telephone book in 
any large city and find listed churches of many faiths. But what qualifies a church? The United States has created a specific definition of a church  
for tax purposes and to delineate the division between church government 
and the federal, state and county governments. For an organization to be 
recognized as a church, wherein all are committed to the same doctrine, rather than a religious organization, in which members may be of many religions and persuasions while sharing a similar philosophy, the Internal 
Revenue Service has developed the following fourteen-point list. 
1. a distinct legal existence; 
of a Mahâdeva or of a deva, or a ku∫∂alinî experience through yoga sâd-
hana are good testimonies but only for the ears of one’s own guru. These 
are not to be shared with others, lest the spiritual power dissipate. Such experiences hold the same sacredness as a private conversation with one’s 
guru, which is held in confidentiality, so that the power of the prâ∫as of 
that auspicious encounter are retained within, between satguru and ßishya, 
to develop and mature.   
About the
Following Chapter410 ¶In the next chaper we analyze the nature of the 
Hindu Church and discuss the modern history of Hindu-
ism in India, and how it survived several major invasions 
and is now enjoying a renaissance, not only in the holy land, but around 
the world.
Mantra  yields early success due to practice done in previous life.

/;/;/;/;/;/;/;/;/; TTERING THE WORD CHURCH CALLS TO MIND A MULTI-FAC-
ETED, INTERNATIONALLY-ACCEPTED FORM OF RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATION. BUT IT IS RARELY USED IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH INDIAN SPIRITUALITY . IN FACT, OURS IS THE FIRST 
HINDU CHURCH ON EARTH. HERE WE EXPLAIN THIS KEY 
CONCEPT, DEFINING CHURCH AND SUMMARIZING ITS 
USE IN OUR MINISTRIES, WHILE OFFERING AN HISTORI-
CAL VIEW AND BRIEF INSIGHTS INTO CHURCH SERVICE.
411 ¶Religious service can also be understood through the Western con-
cept of ministry. The word minister  is both a verb and a noun, derived 
originally from the Latin word, ministrare meaning to supply; to provide; 
to give help to or to attend to needs. In modern use, as a noun, a minister 
is any person thought of as serving as the agent of some other power. In 
government, a prime minister is the chief agent of the people, whose duty 
it is to attend to their needs. There are also other kinds of ministers in 
government such as the minister of defense, the minister of home affairs, 
the minister of foreign affairs. Ministry in religion is similar to minis-try in government, for both attend to the needs of the people. These two 
ministries working together make for a strong society. The words minis-
try and minister  are descriptive terms applicable to all governments and 
to all religions. Ministry cannot be defined as a function belonging to 
one religion more than another. There are many religions today that have 
recognized that the modern church system is the vehicle for the religious 
work of the future. They have developed visible and sophisticated forms 
of ministry, carried out by ordained ministers and lay missionaries under 
their direction. In Íaiva Siddhânta Church, the ma†havâsi community are 
the ministers and the kulapati  community are the missionaries.
Church: an
Ideal VehicleOf Service412 ¶In this century many religions have adopted the 
word church to describe their worldwide organizations 
and local bodies. We can look in the telephone book in 
any large city and find listed churches of many faiths. But what qualifies a church? The United States has created a specific definition of a church  
for tax purposes and to delineate the division between church government 
and the federal, state and county governments. For an organization to be 
recognized as a church, wherein all are committed to the same doctrine, rather than a religious organization, in which members may be of many religions and persuasions while sharing a similar philosophy, the Internal 
Revenue Service has developed the following fourteen-point list. 
1. a distinct legal existence; 
of a Mahâdeva or of a deva, or a ku∫∂alinî experience through yoga sâd-
hana are good testimonies but only for the ears of one’s own guru. These 
are not to be shared with others, lest the spiritual power dissipate. Such experiences hold the same sacredness as a private conversation with one’s 
guru, which is held in confidentiality, so that the power of the prâ∫as of 
that auspicious encounter are retained within, between satguru and ßishya, 
to develop and mature.   
About the
Following Chapter410 ¶In the next chaper we analyze the nature of the 
Hindu Church and discuss the modern history of Hindu-
ism in India, and how it survived several major invasions 
and is now enjoying a renaissance, not only in the holy land, but around 
the world.
Mantra  yields early success due to practice done in previous life. 
Self-fulfilling, too, is the mantra  which is received according to 
the line of tradition, with due dîkshâ, obtained in the right way. 
Innumerable are the mantras ; they but distract the mind. Only that mantra  
which is received through the grace of the guru  gives all fulfillment.

The Value
Of the ModernChurch System414 ¶A look at religion on the planet today shows that 
the most successful churches  have integrated their mission 
with modern forms of social and technological develop-
ment. In doing so they have created highly sophisticated, workable sys-
tems through which their teachings are disseminated. These international 
churches have their executive branches, committees, agencies, communi-cation systems, publishing facilities, ministries and local branches. Their 
local, national and international boards and missionaries work tireless-ly to communicate with members and the public.  A strong church in a 
stable nation can easily be compared to a government within a govern-
ment. The division of church and state, found in democratic societies, will 
become better and better defined as a valuable factor in the preservation 
of the freedoms that a society provides its peoples in the years to come. 
Comparing this to ancient days when Mahârâjas supplicated the sagely 
guidance of ®ishis , today’s church represents the ®ishi, and the government 
represents the râja. In a real sense, there was a separation—and a working 
together—of church and state then just as there is now.  
The Church
SystemIn Hinduism415 ¶The era of the Mahârâjas and Hindu villages where-
in devotees of one tradition lived and worked together is 
gone. In today’s pluralistic, global society, neighbors are 
diverse and aloof. When Hindu churches are formed, they reestablish the 
village community, organizing men, women and children of the same tra-
dition and belief into coherent groups that nurture and advance one and all. They crystallize traditional Hindu community and activity which 
might not otherwise exist in the 21st century’s disparate social cultures. 
Within many modern Hindu denominations and organizations we find 
the elements of church, including monks and nuns, priesthoods, scriptures, 
religious schools, âßramas and seminaries, thousands of temples conduct-
ing daily services. 
About English
ReligiousTerms416 ¶Church is one of many English religious words that 
had their origin in Greek and Latin and were given new 
and Christian meanings by the early Catholics.  Church is 
derived from the Greek kyriakondoma,  meaning “house of the Lord.” Oth-
er such words widely used by Hindus are temple, originally referring to 
the Jewish temple; congregation, from the Jewish, meaning “all the people 
of Israel;” priest, from the early Roman Catholic Church and ultimately derived from Sansk®it. Some of the many other English religious terms

small groups of families connected by bloodlines, spiri-

many of them also family men, went about the countryside proclaiming 
the faith through songs to our Supreme God Íiva. They encouraged public 
worship by worshiping in the great temples of India. And, of course, the 
brâhmins were vowed to maintain the dharma of our religion by conduct-
ing their lives in accordance to ßâstrîc law. In the background, working in 
the microcosm throughout the country were the sannyâsins and sâdhus, 
some of whom occasionally came forward to preach and bless the people.

destroyed in India’s North, mahârâjas were disposed and 
deposed, sannyâsins and sâdhus were scattered, and we 
might surmise that the brâhmins and kulagurus  were forced to curtail 
much of their overt religious activities. This was the first crushing blow to 
the life of Íaivism. Throughout the Muslim occupation of India, the brâh-
min caste still preserved the knowledge of Vedas, maintained the temples 
and performed the services of the faith afforded them by birth. But because of the disruption of society itself, the laity who had been actively involved 
in religious service retreated, leaving the brâhmins alone in charge.  
The Incursion
Of British Christians422 ¶Next came the Christian colonists; the Dutch, Portu-

British set up a bureaucracy of modern political and economic admin-
istration that utilized primarily the brâhmin caste for clerical positions. 
Under the British, the mahârâjas could no longer function as they had, and 
there was no longer a kshatriya caste in power to perpetuate religion as 
they once had. The British further weakened the religious fabric by setting 
up an educational system throughout the country in which Indians were 
taught to ridicule and belittle their own religious heritage and cultural traditions in the name of Western secularism. This system of education 
was established by Lord Macaulay , and it continues to this day.

Íaivism’s
Past PatternsOf Service418 ¶A general and brief review of Íaivism’s past will 
help us understand the need for nurturing and encourag-
ing religious service within this oldest religion today. Let 
us first go back in time to the days of India’s feudal kingdoms. Íaivism 
was administrated by the Mahârâja, the Mahârâja’s kshatriya ministers 
and the brâhmin priests. A benevolent Íaivite king saw to the needs of the 
people, built Íiva temples, schools, ma†has and aadheenams. He was in 
turn often guided by an elderly ®ishi or satguru. The mahârâja supported 
the priesthood, the saints, the pa∫∂itas and the priests who perpetuated 
the temples, the ceremonies, the traditions and the scriptures, bringing 
spiritual upliftment and unfoldment to all. Íaivite culture, by its very 
nature, integrated religious thought and practice in the fabric of daily life, 
thrived and perpetuated itself from one generation to the next.  
Hinduism’s
TraditionalTeachers419 ¶A conclusive analysis of religious culture in India’s 
past may not be possible, since often no historical records 
were kept. Nevertheless, it is obvious that many persons 
were devoted to the maintenance and proclamation of Íaivism. For the 
most part these were householders. There were the ancient ®ishis of the 
Upanishads, such as Y âjñavalkya, a married sage who expounded the 
Truths to kings. There were numerous pa∫∂itas who read the scriptures to 
the people and discussed vital philosophical points. There were the brâh-
mins who performed the sacraments, maintained the sacred scriptures and 
kept the temples active with daily services and numerous festivals each 
year. Many mahârâjas were themselves sages and teachers of the faith.

Hinduism’s
MissionaryForce Globally427 ¶It is indeed fortunate that a vital and growing lay 
missionary force  is emerging on a global scale comprising 
primarily family men and women who are dedicated to 
furthering religion, improving conditions in their society and assisting 
others. Many are official emissaries of established organizations, church-es, monasteries, temples and yoga schools. All are inspired from within, 
reaching out as a cohesive, loving force to provide aid in times of need, 
counsel in moments of confusion, comfort in periods of despair and clar-
ity at cross roads of decision. They come from all walks of life: priests, doc-
tors, laborers, housewives, attorneys, and more, each offering his or her 
special gifts to the community. Hindu ministry has blossomed over the 
past fifty years. Campus ministries, once limited to Christian ministers 
and Jewish rabbis, are now also conducted by Hindus, with thousands of 
students gaining confidence in their words. Hospital visitation ministries 
have sprung up in many countries, as small bands of Hindus take flowers, 
song, devotion and encouragement to the ill or injured. Hindu swâmîs and 
lay ministers in dozens of countries outside India are called upon to share 
pastoral duties with ministers of other faiths at civic events. T emples in 
America, India, Sri Lanka, England, Trinidad and T obago and elsewhere 
feed the poor and help the needy and homeless. 
About the
FollowingChapter428 ¶The essence of our next chapter, spiritual people liv-
ing in harmony, is captured in a story. Hundreds of years 
ago in the city of Madurai, known as the Athens of India 
for its cultural achievements, at the Meenakshi Somasundareßvara Íivan Koyil there was constructed within the vast temple tank a magic boat  
called the philosophers’ barge. ‰ishis came from the Himâlayas, pa∫∂itas 
from all corners of India and humble bhakta siddhas from the South to 
sit together and discuss life, illumination and release from mortality and 
rebirth. The magic lay in the boat’s extraordinary ability to expand to 
accommodate any number of people who conversed with an attitude of 
respect and harmony. But it grew sm aller when discussion turned rancor-
ous, and those who brought the contention suddenly found themselves in 
the water, swimming to shore in embarrassment. In Íiva’s temple, it seems, 
only nonargumentative discussion was allowed. We have no magic boat 
today, or maybe we do, as you will learn while exploring penance in the 
next chapter. 
infrastructure, the one it had before the Muslims first came to power 1,000 
years earlier. Hinduism might not have survived at all but for its tight 
extended family structure.  After independence in 1947 , the secularization 
of India was virtually complete. The swâmîs came forward to fill the void 
left by the many brâhmins leaving their dharma to become doctors and 
engineers. They became the primary religious leaders, the full-time min-
isters, the amachars, the proselytizers of Sanâtana Dharma. They became 
father, mother, râja to some, minister to others and an image of divinity to 
hundreds of thousands of Hindus of all sects.  
The Upsurge
Of RenaissanceLeaders 424 ¶It is fortunate for all of us that despite the secular-
ization of India, many noble souls maintained their reli-
gious attitudes and kindled the fires of faith over the past 
century. Írî Arumuga Navalar of Sri Lanka, Swâmî Vivekânanda and many other Hindu renaissance leaders took up the ministry of inspired procla-
mation and they expounded in a powerful way the teachings of Íaiva Sid-

books. Râma Tîrtha and other savants traveled around the world teaching 
and setting up missions and societies. Thousands of new organizations 
began to do social work from the platform of Hinduism.  
The Need
For LayMissionaries 425 ¶The work of these swâmîs  has been a lifeline for 
the Sanâtana Dharma. But it has always been known that 
swâmîs alone are not enough to serve the needs of Hin-
dus. Though they  number into the hundreds of thousands, their sannyâsa  
dharma necessarily prohibits them from over-involvement in the world, in 
family and in social problems. It is the task of their followers, the leaders 
within the family community, to fulfill the kinds of service that are part 
of their family g®ihastha and vâ∫aprastha dharma. With this in mind, the 
swâmîs have set up training schools and camps to encourage devotees to 
further the religion in the lives of children, youth and families, to serve 
God through serving humanity, to spread the message of the Vedas, to 
stand strong for Hinduism.

Vivekânanda, this renaissance movement  of new energy 
and Hindu pride has swept across the planet, touching 
the hearts of Hindus in every community. Each community has dozens 
of effective programs, and is developing more. The lay missionaries, see-
ing how much religion is needed in this day and age, are consulting with 
their gurus, sâdhus, swâmîs, yogîs, pa∫∂itas and elders to find new ways to

the hungry and perform uplifting service in more than 120 countries.  
Hinduism’s
MissionaryForce Globally427 ¶It is indeed fortunate that a vital and growing lay 
missionary force  is emerging on a global scale comprising 
primarily family men and women who are dedicated to 
furthering religion, improving conditions in their society and assisting 
others. Many are official emissaries of established organizations, church-es, monasteries, temples and yoga schools. All are inspired from within, 
reaching out as a cohesive, loving force to provide aid in times of need, 
counsel in moments of confusion, comfort in periods of despair and clar-
ity at cross roads of decision. They come from all walks of life: priests, doc-
tors, laborers, housewives, attorneys, and more, each offering his or her 
special gifts to the community. Hindu ministry has blossomed over the 
past fifty years. Campus ministries, once limited to Christian ministers 
and Jewish rabbis, are now also conducted by Hindus, with thousands of 
students gaining confidence in their words. Hospital visitation ministries 
have sprung up in many countries, as small bands of Hindus take flowers, 
song, devotion and encouragement to the ill or injured. Hindu swâmîs and 
lay ministers in dozens of countries outside India are called upon to share 
pastoral duties with ministers of other faiths at civic events. T emples in 
America, India, Sri Lanka, England, Trinidad and T obago and elsewhere 
feed the poor and help the needy and homeless. 
About the
FollowingChapter428 ¶The essence of our next chapter, spiritual people liv-
ing in harmony, is captured in a story. Hundreds of years 
ago in the city of Madurai, known as the Athens of India 
for its cultural achievements, at the Meenakshi Somasundareßvara Íivan Koyil there was constructed within the vast temple tank a magic boat  
called the philosophers’ barge. ‰ishis came from the Himâlayas, pa∫∂itas 
from all corners of India and humble bhakta siddhas from the South to 
sit together and discuss life, illumination and release from mortality and 
rebirth. The magic lay in the boat’s extraordinary ability to expand to 
accommodate any number of people who conversed with an attitude of 
respect and harmony. But it grew sm aller when discussion turned rancor-
ous, and those who brought the contention suddenly found themselves in 
the water, swimming to shore in embarrassment. In Íiva’s temple, it seems, 
only nonargumentative discussion was allowed. We have no magic boat 
today, or maybe we do, as you will learn while exploring penance in the 
next chapter. 
infrastructure, the one it had before the Muslims first came to power 1,000 
years earlier. Hinduism might not have survived at all but for its tight 
extended family structure.  After independence in 1947 , the secularization 
of India was virtually complete. The swâmîs came forward to fill the void 
left by the many brâhmins leaving their dharma to become doctors and 
engineers. They became the primary religious leaders, the full-time min-
isters, the amachars, the proselytizers of Sanâtana Dharma. They became 
father, mother, râja to some, minister to others and an image of divinity to 
hundreds of thousands of Hindus of all sects.  
The Upsurge
Of RenaissanceLeaders 424 ¶It is fortunate for all of us that despite the secular-
ization of India, many noble souls maintained their reli-
gious attitudes and kindled the fires of faith over the past 
century. Írî Arumuga Navalar of Sri Lanka, Swâmî Vivekânanda and many other Hindu renaissance leaders took up the ministry of inspired procla-
mation and they expounded in a powerful way the teachings of Íaiva Sid-
dhânta and V edânta. Írî Aurobindo, Swâmî Íivânanda and others wrote 
books. Râma Tîrtha and other savants traveled around the world teaching 
and setting up missions and societies. Thousands of new organizations 
began to do social work from the platform of Hinduism.

as unrestrained devotion, confession, repentance and rec-onciliation. When penance  is given, it must be fulfilled, 
especially when requested. Otherwise, the life of the penitent is vulner-able to the company of asuras.  Penance is given after a certain amount of 
remorse is shown and the urgency is felt by the individual to rid his mind 
of the plaguing matter. All help is given by the divine devas to those seen 
performing a sincere penance. These devas that oversee those in a peni-
tent state of mind are similar to doctors and nurses gathered to help their 
patient become well again. The angelic helpers  surround their “patient,” 
assisting in the relief of mental and emotional illness caused by trans-
gression of dharma and the guilt that follows. When the penitent is under-
going penance, it is a form of tapas, described by some as psychic surgery 
performed by the devas working together to bring the soul from darkness 
into light. It truly is a happy event, but only long after it is over. The guru 
of every pî†ham receives the verbal confession  of ßishyas and gives out 
the appropriate penance, prâyaßchitta. He recognizes Divine absolution , 
knowing the penance has been fulfilled, when the inner aura is bright as 
a new-born child, the face happy and the testimony on the result of the 
penance discloses true atonement. In our Church, the period specifically 
dedicated to confession, repentance and reconciliation is the third season, 
Moksha ‰itau.

PenancePenance, the
Means ofReconciling434 ¶There are many forms of penance , prâyaßchitta , 
such as 1,008 prostrations before Gods Ga∫eßa, Murugan 
or Supreme God Íiva, apologizing and showing shame for 
misdeeds, performing japa slowly 1,008 times on the holy rudrâksha beads, 
giving of 108 handmade gifts to the temple; performing manual chores at 
the temple for 108 hours, such as cleaning; making garlands, arranging 
flowers; bringing offerings of cooked food; performing kavadi with min-
iature spears inserted in the flesh , making a pilgrimage by prostrating 
the body’s length again and again, rolling around a temple, and more . All 
these and more are major means of atonement after each individual con-
fession has been made. The keynote in serious cases is asking one’s guru  
to give a specific penance  once the problem has been revealed.  Once the 
guru is asked for penance, the penance must be performed exactly accord-
ing to his instruction. It should be done with full energy and without delay. 
Deliberate delay or refusal to perform the penance shows the devotee has rejected the assistance of the guru. Further advice and guidance will not 
be forthcoming until the instruction has been fulfilled. Therefore, a devo-
tee in such a condition does not approach. One may, however, beseech the 
guru for assistance and continued guidance if one is in the process of ful-
filling the penance over a period of time. 
The Steps
Of Atonement,A Summary435 ¶The inner cleansing process of unwanted vâsanâs  
occurs in this order: confession, repentance—expressed by 
the showing of remorse and shame—and finally reconcili-
ation. Therefore, each individual admittance of a subconscious burden too 
heavy to carry must have its own reconciliation to clear the inner aura of 
vâsanâs and replenish the inner bodies for the struggle the individual has 
had to endure in unwinding from the coils of the lower, instinctive mind 
which block the intellect and obscures spiritual values. When no longer 
protected by its ignorance, the soul longs for release and cries out for sol-
ace. Prâyaßchitta, penance, is then the solution to dissolve the agony and 
bring ßânti.  
Daily Sâdhana
PreservesSublimity436 ¶All members without exception perform daily sâd-
hana before dawn and read the daily lessons of The Mas-
ter Course  before sleep . All strive to manifest in their lives 
and homes the purified intellect of the higher nature. Keeping up with this 
sâdhana keeps the entire subconscious clear so that meditation becomes a 
natural state of mind. The magnetic forces of the lower nature are indeed 
strong. Fear, anger, jealousy and adharmic beliefs, attitudes and actions 
May the Lord find 
pleasure in our song of praise! Priest among men, may he offer due homage to the heav-enly beings! Great, O Lord, is your renown.
‰IG VEDA 5.13.3. VE, 854Confession
AndRepentance431 ¶We all know the refined feeling of bhakti. Every 
religious person in the world has experienced this at one 
time or another. It is the total surrendering of oneself to 
God and the Gods. As the soul emerges out of the lower aspects of the 
instinctive mind, and the mûlâdhâra chakra  begins to unfold because of 
the bhakti that has been awakened through daily worship and sâdhana, 
admittance and honest confession then brings up repentant feelings from 
the sub-superconscious mind quite unbidden. When this happens within the devotee, it is truly a boon, marking progress on the spiritual path. Con-
fession, the voice of the soul, can now be heard. As the intellect clears, 
the honest truths of experience formerly hidden to oneself as well as to 
others are revealed. The soul, the conscience, emerges in all honesty and 
repentantly confesses the burdens it has been carrying. Y es, confession 
is truly the voice of the soul. Nothing is hidden to oneself when dharma 
supersedes adharma.  
How to
Make aConfession432 ¶As a mature being in the higher nature above the 
mûlâdhâra chakra,  ever seeking higher plateaus through 
sâdhana, the Íaivite seeks peace whenever the mind is 
troubled. How does such a Íaivite confess? How does one tell of the reac-tions to misdeeds performed in all innocence when but a child in the 
lower consciousness, living in the lower nature, below the mûlâdhâra 
chakra?  How and whom does one tell of misdeeds performed during a 
lapse of conscience even when living a life of dharma? A Íaivite confesses 
to God Íiva, the Gods or his guru . T o confess to God Íiva, go to His temple 
and mentally, psychically place your burden at the holy feet of the mûrti 
in the sanctum sanctorum. T o confess to Gods Murugan or Ga∫eßa, go to 
their temple and place your confession at their holy feet. Or go to your 
guru and tell him of your inner plight, holding nothing back. This is how a 
Íaivite confesses inner burdens as he emerges out of the instinctive mind 
of the lower nature into the purified intellect of the higher nature.  
Reconciliation
Is FoodFor the Soul433 ¶Y es, reconciliation is food for the soul. After the 
soul has unburdened itself of the dross of the lower mind 
through honest confession, a resolution must be made not 
to reenter the lower states or rekindle the flames of the chakras below the 
mûlâdhâra. T o achieve reconciliation by apology for hurts caused another, 
or to atone by performing acts of penance if a long time has passed since 
the apology could have been made and received, is truly food for the soul.

Penanceand forgetting with the firm resolve to never bring up the matter again. It 
is based on the common understanding that by working together on the 
firm foundation of love and trust all will progress in religious service and 
worship in the right way. Through these efforts, a sukarmaphala, fruit of 
right doing, is deliberately created.  When two ßishyas sit to settle a dis-
harmony, it is often helpful for an uninvolved third party to be present to balance the energies. 
Disharmony
ExtendingFor Three Days439 ¶If a conflict is not resolved within 72 hours, then 
the vâsanâs, or subconscious inclinations, of the event ger-
minate. It is the duty of the talaivar, kulapati, kulamâtâ, 
mukhya, g®ihi∫î or any member of the family or group to inform the 
Aadheenam of any conflict that has persisted for more than a 72-hour 
period.  If the Aadheenam is not informed and the matter is concealed, 
this is considered a breach of the guru-ßishya relationship’s established 
loyalties which will disrupt the progress of the entire group in which the 
disharmony occurs and negatively affect the broader community as well. 
The Pî†ham casts no blame and will help whenever informed of such dif-
ficulties, attempting to heal the breach, strengthen ties and resolve the 
matter. The fact that all have chosen to avoid facing the difficulty shows 
that more serious remedies are required to resolve it. 
Conflict in
A CouncilOn Ministries440 ¶If contention persists among a council on missions  
to the point where its kulapatis can no longer sit togeth-
er in peace and harmony, then a special, severe remedy 
may be given by the Pî†ham: all mission activities are suspended for a minimum period of 31 days, allowing a time for  healing. Successful recu-
peration requires that each kulapati in the mission individually commu-
nicate with his spiritual preceptor for personal guidance. Those involved 
in the kukarmaphala are encouraged to perform the vâsanâ daha tantra  
to gain release from the subconscious burdens. All are enjoined to fulfill the remedy of showing of remorse, talking together in small groups, and the giving of gifts as reconciliation. When all contentions are resolved and the prâ∫as are felt by all kulapatis to be flowing properly, the Pî†ham is 
informed and permission to begin mission activities is sought. After this, 
the problems should never be spoken of again. If by the end of the 31-day 
moratorium the reconciliations have not been made—due to an excess of 
the three big “ A’s,” â∫ava, avidyâ and ahaμkâra —another 31-day period is 
automatically added as an additional hrî prâyaßchitta. This could go on 
for three to six months or more.

TAIT. S., 1.6.8.1. VE, 401are seen today as a way of life. Daily sâdhana keeps each devotee free 
of these forces, and on the right track, of dharma , the perfect San Mârga 
of Íuddha Íaiva Siddhânta. Remember, when one’s true bhakti has begun, 
confession comes forth as the natural outpouring of the soul, and repen-
tance for any past misdeeds is sure to follow. Reconciliation is the food for the soul as it replenishes its outer mind.  
Harmony, the
Keynote ofReligious Life437 ¶All ßishya are instruments of peace wherever they 
are. We have zero tolerance for disharmony of any kind. 
Harmony is held as the first and foremost standard of liv-
ing in all spheres. The striving for harmony begins within the home and 
radiates out into all dimensions of life, enhancing and making joyous and 
sublime each relationship of each devotee. Thus, each ßishya strives to be 
kindly in thought, word and deed, to unfold the beautiful, giving quali-
ties of the soul. Attitudes are never cultivated which give rise to hurting the feelings of others or pushing others down to make oneself look more 
important. The great Tamil Saint Tiruvalluvar offers the following sage 
advice in Tirukural verse 100: “T o utter harsh words when sweet ones 
would serve is like eating unripe fruit when ripe ones are at hand.” If 
someone inadvertently hurts or offends another, the injured party never 
responds in a like manner but forgives and forgets the affront, remember-
ing verse 152 from the Tirukural: “It is good to always endure the injuries 
done to you, but to forget them is even better.”  All difficult feelings are 
resolved before sleep , lest they give rise to mental argument and germi-
nate as unwanted troublesome vâsanâs that cannot be totally erased, but 
only softened and neutralized through the mystic processes of atonement.
Remedy
to DissolveDisharmony438 ¶If disharmony, also known as disruption of the 
harmonious prâ∫ic flow, does occur between any ßishy-
as—anger, argument, back-biting, walking out of meet-
ings, hurt feelings—it should be resolved before sleep. If the disruption is 
not resolved before sleep, then a kukarmaphala,  fruit of wrongdoing, has 
been created. The hurt feelings and mental arguments continue to fester 
until the matter is brought up and openly faced to be resolved. Resolu-
tion is accomplished through the hrî prâyaßchitta: apology , the showing 
of remorse, talking together in small groups and giving gifts as reconcili-ation. Humility is the keynote. Resolution is accomplished most quickly 
by sincere apology for participating in argument or confusion. Even if one 
was not necessarily to blame, the karma was there that attracted the situ-
ation. Harmony is reinstated by honestly accepting apologies, by forgiving

Penanceand forgetting with the firm resolve to never bring up the matter again. It 
is based on the common understanding that by working together on the 
firm foundation of love and trust all will progress in religious service and 
worship in the right way. Through these efforts, a sukarmaphala, fruit of 
right doing, is deliberately created.  When two ßishyas sit to settle a dis-
harmony, it is often helpful for an uninvolved third party to be present to balance the energies. 
Disharmony
ExtendingFor Three Days439 ¶If a conflict is not resolved within 72 hours, then 
the vâsanâs, or subconscious inclinations, of the event ger-
minate. It is the duty of the talaivar, kulapati, kulamâtâ, 
mukhya, g®ihi∫î or any member of the family or group to inform the 
Aadheenam of any conflict that has persisted for more than a 72-hour 
period.  If the Aadheenam is not informed and the matter is concealed, 
this is considered a breach of the guru-ßishya relationship’s established 
loyalties which will disrupt the progress of the entire group in which the 
disharmony occurs and negatively affect the broader community as well. 
The Pî†ham casts no blame and will help whenever informed of such dif-
ficulties, attempting to heal the breach, strengthen ties and resolve the 
matter. The fact that all have chosen to avoid facing the difficulty shows 
that more serious remedies are required to resolve it. 
Conflict in
A CouncilOn Ministries440 ¶If contention persists among a council on missions  
to the point where its kulapatis can no longer sit togeth-
er in peace and harmony, then a special, severe remedy 
may be given by the Pî†ham: all mission activities are suspended for a minimum period of 31 days, allowing a time for  healing. Successful recu-
peration requires that each kulapati in the mission individually commu-
nicate with his spiritual preceptor for personal guidance. Those involved 
in the kukarmaphala are encouraged to perform the vâsanâ daha tantra  
to gain release from the subconscious burdens. All are enjoined to fulfill the remedy of showing of remorse, talking together in small groups, and the giving of gifts as reconciliation. When all contentions are resolved and the prâ∫as are felt by all kulapatis to be flowing properly, the Pî†ham is 
informed and permission to begin mission activities is sought. After this, 
the problems should never be spoken of again. If by the end of the 31-day

for three to six months or more.

Two-Month
Retreat forRecuperation443 ¶We have found through the years that a two-month 
retreat is a rewarding remedy  for the conditions described 
above, to be applied according to the wisdom of the 
Pî†ham. The family is asked not to mix with other members during this 
time. They are advised to hold family gatherings often, remain unto them-
selves in a quarantine situation and settle matters in their own home, their shrine room, among themselves, and become fully reestablished in living 
the Íaiva Dharma. When the two-month retreat ends, a ceremony is held 
by the kulapatis and kulamâtâs of their mission welcoming them back 
into participation. Now private talks can resume with peers and elders 
when needed. This remedy, or prâyaßchitta , can also be helpful for two or 
more families who are having trouble getting along, who find themselves 
criticizing one another and causing upset to the mission as a whole. The 
retreat from mission activities gives time to do more sâdhanas and temple 
worship to help them understand why the difficulty has arisen. 
The Power
Of SpiritualInsight444 ¶Disruptions among ßishyas can be avoided through 
vidyâ —spiritual insight, intuitive knowing—which brings 
compassion and the ability to get along and work har-
moniously with others. Vidyâ overcomes ahaμkâra —personal I-ness, or 
ego, and the need for personal recognition, the sense of I-ness, “me” and 
“mine.” Vidyâ overshadows â∫ava —the individuating veil of duality, source 
of ignorance and finitude—for the greater good of the whole. Vidyâ by 
its own merit overwhelms ignorance, avidyâ, for the goals of the group 
to manifest. What is this incredible force called vidyâ? Vidyâ is the grace 
of Lord Íiva given to all within His chakravâla.  All kulapatis must sit in 
graceful, egoless servitude as clear channels for the divine forces to mani-
fest the mission of the mission.

Confessions toClear the Past441 ¶Íiva is the Life of our life, but what about the dead,

see this as any part of Íiva at all. Íiva permeates every 
place else but not here, we feel, in the secret corners of our own mind. 
This duality, this two-ness seeking oneness, cannot be conquered by air. 
It cannot be conquered by âkâßa. Mind cannot rationalize away the deep 
hurt of injustice, or even admit unto its most inner self that the same injus-
tice experienced in this life was inflicted upon another in a previous life. It 
cannot be conquered by water. Y ou cannot wash it away. It cannot be con-quered by earth. It can only be conquered by fire. Write these grievances and confessions, clearly defined, and place them in an ordinary fire. Look at the fire . It is the only pure element today. Åkâßa is polluted with nega-
tive thoughts and heinous deeds on an overpopulated planet. The water 
is undrinkable, the air unbreathable. The Earth is hurting from the loss 
of its forests and all of Íiva’s creatures therein. In the heart of the Kali 
Yuga, we have only fire to depend upon. It is not polluted. It feeds upon the 
good things of the Earth, and on pollution itself. The ordinary fire, your 
mind going within it, will lift your own ku∫∂alinî fire  for a moment and 
burn yourself free from negative attachment and all the past experiences locked in your subconscious. As fire burns within seconds, a ku∫∂alinî

When sâdhana is neglected, problems close in. Families find it difficult to 
see eye to eye. Hard feelings arise in even the simplest and well-intended 
encounters, for the neglectful individuals have become too externalized. 
When such difficulties repeatedly occur around a particular family, it is 
invariably found that the performance of daily sâdhana has been all but

that its leadership can concentrate upon fulfilling its goals rather than

schools and other institutions to have to worry about money, knowing it

HHE’s
Founding And Purpose447 ¶On the  physical plane, the Hindu Heritage Endow-
ment is a public service trust which seeks to establish and maintain permanent sources of income for Hindu institu-
tions worldwide. The HHE was founded in December, 1993, through the 
signing of its Declaration of Trust. On April 20, 1994, it received recogni-
tion of its status as a tax-exempt public charitable foundation from the 
United States Internal Revenue Service. On April 22, 1994, Hindu Heritage 
Endowment commenced the charitable activities described in this chap-
ter of the Íaiva Dharma Íâstras . The mission of Hindu Heritage Endow-
ment, which is strictly religious and nonpolitical, is to strengthen Hindu 
religious traditions throughout the world by providing Hindu institutions 
with a permanent and growing source of income in order to assure their 
financial stability and further their diverse programs. As Tirukural verse 
333 reminds us, “Wealth's nature is to be unenduring. Upon acquiring it, 
quickly do that which is enduring.” There are three steps to the accom-
plishment of this mission. 
1. Individuals and charitable institutions are regularly approached by 
HHE for contributions and are invited to choose the specific organizations 
extraordinary ways. Those were the days of the Mahârâjas. In time, wealth 
was granted by complex karmas to the Muslim faith, then later to the 
Christians and the followers of Judaism. The Vish∫u power of preservation 
of material abundance is invoked through good deeds, and it is revoked 
when violence in thought, word and deed arises, leading to anarchy in 
the home, the city, the country. The high-minded concept of Hindu Heri-tage Endowment, as the next chapter will explain, is one service we offer to bring money back into Hindu institutions, artistic schools and halls 
of learning. By understanding wealth and its preservation into the future, each Hindu can make the Hindu world go ’round in style. 
A man should think on wealth and strive to win it by adoration 
on the path of Order, counsel himself with his own mental insight, 
and grasp still nobler vigor with his spirit.

Be unremitting in the doing of good deeds.Do them with all your might and by every possible means.

Endowmentaged. One hundred percent of each gift is invested and grows at a rate of 
three percent annually. 
Three Ways
Of Giving to Endowments 450 ¶Gifts to the Hindu Heritage Endowment can be made 
in many ways, including: an outright gift of cash, securi-
ties or real estate; a bequest through a will; a gift of life 
insurance; a deferred gift such as a charitable remainder trust where life income is retained.  Hindu Heritage Endowment offers a choice between 
three types of donations: 1) establishing a multi-donor fund; 2) contribut-
ing to an existing multi-donor fund; 3) establishing a single donor fund. A 
multi-donor fund can be created and then receive contributions from an 
unlimited number of individuals. It is an appropriate choice when donors 
wish others to also contribute to the fund. The listing of funds shows the 
name of the beneficiary institution or project but does not show the name 
of the fund’s creator. The minimum donation to establish a new multi-donor 
fund is us$5,000. Donations to an existing multi-donor fund can be of any 
amount.  A single-donor fund can only receive contributions from those 
who create it. The listing of funds shows the name of the fund’s creators, 
the individuals to whom it is dedicated and the beneficiary institutions. It 
is an appropriate choice when donors wish to dedicate the gift in honor or 
memory of a loved one. The minimum donation to establish a new single-
donor fund is also us$5,000. Subsequent donations may be of any amount.  
The Gift
MultiplierPlan451 ¶If a donor so wishes, a gift can be used to create a 
fund up to ten times the amount of the gift. For example, a 
gift of only $10,000 can be used to  create a fund of $100,000. 
An increase of ten times takes about twenty-five to thirty years. This is 
accomplished by adding the investment income to the fund principal until 
the principal reaches the agreed upon goal. From then onward, the benefi-
ciary receives the investment income, in this case initially approximately 
$5,000 per year.  
HHE’s
BeneficiaryQualifications452 ¶ For the trustees of HHE to qualify an organization 
as a beneficiary, the organization, in addition to providing a list of one or more projects that are to be approved by 
HHE, should provide appropriate documentation that it is recognized as a 
charity under its own local law. It must also demonstrate that its activities are primarily devoted to religious purposes in furtherance of traditional and classical Hindu principles and practices.
they wish their gift to benefit. 
2. Contributions received are permanently invested as separate endow-
ment funds. These investments are professionally managed and screened 
for social responsibility that accords with Hindu ethical principles. For 
example, companies that treat animals inhumanely are avoided. 
3. The investment income earned by each endowment is regularly distrib-
uted to the beneficiary organization for it to use in furthering its plans and 
programs, in keeping with the donor’s wishes.  However, in order to con-
tinue to qualify for tax exemption and provide tax deductions to donors, the HHE is required by the Internal Revenue Service to attain and approve 
a yearly grant application, including a detailed description of the specific 
purpose of the request before disbursing income. Applications must also 
contain an accounting of the previous year’s grant, if any, in sufficient detail to satisfy HHE that the previous grant was used for a proper purpose. 
Types of
Potential Beneficiaries448 ¶Beneficiaries  can be Hindu institutions, located in 
any country of the world, dedicated to traditional and classical Hindu principles and practices, and which HHE 
has determined have one or more specific projects that qualify as proper 
purposes for a donation. An endowment can be established for: hereditary 
temples, annual festivals, children’s retreat camps, village shrines, âßra-
mas and ma†has,  religious publications, pa†haßâlas  (priest training cen-
ters), favorite pilgrimage sites, shelters for sâdhus , gifts for cow protection, 
Hindu yoga schools, institutes for music, art, drama and dance, schools of 
sacred architecture, scriptural or philosophical research centers, subsidies 
for pa∫∂itas and ßâstrîs , support of âyurveda, jyotisha and other sacred 
sciences, a favorite swâmî’s movement or project, grants, scholarships, aca-
demic chairs for Hindu studies and more.  
Advantages

It is a gift that keeps on giving. 
2. Donors value the flexible way they can choose as beneficiaries Hindu 
institutions located in any country of the world. 
3. Donors in many countries receive significant tax deductions for their 
contributions, which are particularly advantageous when contributing an appreciated asset.

Businessmen’s Association works, how it benefits mem-

financial stability in these competitive times. It was founded many years 
ago and has held meetings in unbroken continuity each month in several countries. Hear now how people with experience help others get expe-

others do the same. Also presented here is our Hindu Workingmen’s Asso-ciation. 
Unless you’re from the Birla family, men in your family probably 
started out as employees, working under someone else on salary. There’s 
an art to being a good employee. The HWA is a no-nonsense group of mem-

and how to make all devotees the servants of the servants of the Lord, our 
CEO or Creator and Earth Officer. Finally, the next chapter discusses two 
other vital Church agencies, the Hindu Student’s Association, formally established just this year, and the Râjarâja Chola Gurukulam, which first 
started in 1980 under the name “Indo-American Íaivite Schools.”

1. Be successful in speaking and writing. Win with words; be effective at 
conferences and write clear communications. 
2. Deal w isely and f airly with people. Keep employees working with you, 
for you and not against you. 
3. Think like an executive who makes things happen through others, not 
like a laborer concerned with his own task only. Keep the overview, har-

Wealth
From theAngelic View464 ¶Wealth is passed from one generation to the next as 
local laws permit. Wealth consist also of having gold and 
precious stones  within the home. During daily puja,  these 
substances are easily seen on the astral plane by the devas, who are com-
missioned to sustain wealth and are expert in seeing into the future and 
giving great business ideas through thought-form transference. In reverse, 
when wealth once acquired is used for hurtfulness, these same devas 
are ordered to withdraw their powers and allow the family to go to rack and ruin. All this is deva knowledge, genie knowledge. Each household 
should have as much gold as the monthly income is expected to be. Gold 
is real money in any currency in the world. Its very vibration sustains the 
mental force field of business and home.  Gold, silver and precious gems 
attract more abundance . A woman’s jewelry  augments her natural  ßakti 
and in turn makes her husband more successful. The devas conceive of 
money as pure energy to be used to sustain society. This inner-plane group 
of money people respond to sincere prayers for wealth, such as the Saint 
Sambandar’s Devaram  which many families sing daily after pûjâ, as brâh-
ma muhûrta is ending . When an HBA group is sitting in their chakravâla, 
they are open to the influence of their collective devonic contingency. The 
room becomes filled with the energy of inspiration and security.

Workingmen’sAssociation465 ¶There is a special power in the excellent employee 
who sees to the employer’s needs before being asked. This 
is emphasized in seminars and discussions of the Hindu 
Workingmen’s Association  (HWA), in which men focus on job performance, 
problem-solving and financial planning. The HWA encourages promotions 
and progress into management. Its motto  is “We prosper by serving the 
business of others as if it were our own.” Artha , one of the four goals of 
life, is security as well as abundance, living within one’s means. It is a 
goal of every Hindu family to achieve material welfare and abundance 
through dharmic occupation so that security is maintained through the

Membership 
And Dues inThe HBA462 ¶Membership in the Hindu Businessmen’s Association  
is open to all adult male Church members and arul ßishyas 
in good standing who own their own business, be it a sole 
proprietorship, partnership or corporation. They must also have a good 
tithing record, an acceptable financial statement and the endorsement of the local Hindu Workingmen’s Association. One, two or three percent is 
payable as HBA dues on the company’s gross profit. Each member decides 
which percent he will contribute. For retail and wholesale merchandising 
concerns, the percentage is calculated on gross profit (gross sales minus 
the cost of goods sold). For service businesses, the percentage is calculat-
ed on gross fees. For businesses that include fees for service and sale of 
products, the percentage is calculated on gross profit and gross fees.  Each 
month the HBA pechâlar sends the dues collected to the Hindu Heritage 
Endowment office to be credited to the Hindu Businessmen’s Association 
Trust. The grants provided by from this endowment are used for the pur-

5. Next the talaivar  inquires if there are any opportunities to assist fel-
lowship members who are out of work or starting out in new jobs. Indi-
vidual cases may be discussed and plans made to give assistance.
6.  Next the talaivar asks for news of progress made since the last meet-
ing on the HWA’s fifth and sixth purposes: promoting Hindu solidarity 
and promoting fellowship among Church businessmen by communicating 
regularly with other HWAs, etc.
7. Finally, the pechâlar collects the monthly dues from all present and 
gives a brief financial report, including an update on gifts of The Master 
Course books made possible by these funds. 
The Art of
SpiritualizingMundane Work467 ¶The first purpose of the HWA is to enhance the voca-
tional skills of its members by bringing positive spiritu-
al attitudes into the daily work situation, inspiring each 
member to fully adopt the profound perspective that one’s work is also 
his worship, rather than a “secular” activity that he endures to earn the 
money to do what he really wants to do. Each member works to approach 
his daily task, not with the mentality of a hired hand, but as a skilled 
artisan, a craftsman or a poet, knowing that each effort, each act, however 
small, is important.  
Instilling 
DynamicWork Ethics468 ¶The second purpose of the HWA is to promote dynam-
ic work ethics to establish a professional relationship with 
one’s employer, to endear oneself to management by being 
cooperative, responsive, responsible, cheerful, doing a better job than expected, arriving a little early and leaving a little late. The devas, experts 
in their field,  who work with the HWA are interested in creating excel-
lent servants. There is a natural tendency for those working for others to 
resent their employment, bring frustration home and take it out on their 
wife and children. These devas want HWA members to rise above such 
tendencies, and instead be the best of servants, for to be a perfect servant 
means to be master of oneself. They help in many unseen ways, but must 
be invoked through daily pûjâ to be held close enough to Earth conscious-
ness to be effective. Mastering the art of humble servitude means egoless 
service, being the perfect employee any employer would dream of having 
in his workplace: the “first-rate second man .” 
The Ågamas explain, 
Only a well-qualified priest may perform both âtmârtha pûjâ , 
worship for one’s self, and parârtha pûjâ , wor-
ship for others. Such an Ådißaiva is a Íaiva brâhmin and 
a teacher.
KÅRAIA ÅGAMA 18. BO MT, 75years and all needs are amply fulfilled. T oward this end, the HWA encour-
ages each workingman to continue to improve his skills, to advance in 
his position and profession through being a good, dependable, productive 
employee.  The Hindu Workingmen’s Association, Hindu Íudradharma 
Samâja, was founded on Guru Pûr∫imâ, July 4, 1993.  It follows the same 
administrative and seating procedures of the kulapati preshana chakravâ-
la. This eliminates the need for the election of officers.
Membership
Dues andMeetings466 ¶Membership  is open to all employed adult male 
Church members and arulßishyas in good standing. Dues 
are $11 per month in the US, and determined locally in 
other countries.  Each HWA has dinner meetings (or breakfast or luncheon) 
the first Saturday of every month in a private room of a local restaurant 
or hotel. The meetings are informal and in the nature of the Asian Hindu 
sa˜ga.  Everyone sits around the table according to chakravâla seniority. 
The talaivar conducts the meeting according to the following agenda. The 
various courses of the meal are served while the items on the agenda are 
being discussed. Each meeting lasts about two and one-half hours.
1. If there is a guest speaker, the talaivar  gives a special welcome and 
asks him to give a presentation sharing his wisdom and experience with 
the group. This portion may take 20 to 30 minutes or longer. If the topic is 
particularly inspiring, since guest speakers only attend occasionally, more 
time may be alloted according to the discretion of the talaivar, and other 
parts of the agenda may be foreshortened to compensate. All guest speak-
ers  must be approved ahead of time by the Pî†ham. If there is no guest 
speaker, the talaivar inquires at this time about potential speakers for 
future meetings, and arrangements are planned as needed.
2. Next, the talaivar, turns the group’s attention to the first purpose of the 
HWA: enhancing vocational skills through positive, spiritual attitudes. He 
allots about 20 minutes for this part of the meeting, asking for testimony 
from individuals around the chakravâla. He keeps note of those who don’t 
have the opportunity to share their experience at this time so they can be 
invited to do so at the next meeting or the next. T estimony focuses on the 
ethics listed in paragraph 472. 
3. The HWA’s second purpose is the next item on the agenda: being excel-
lent employees through the keys of the “first-rate second man,” as des-
cribed in paragraph 473. Individuals around the chakravâla  are invited to 
share testimony in this area.
4. Next is a time for problem solving. The talaivar inquires of any difficul-

Benefits of
The HW A,A Summary471 ¶The benefits of belonging to the Hindu Workingmen’s 
Association  include: 
1. the opportunity to further the mission of our Kailâsa 
Paramparâ by distributing The Master Course trilogy;
2.  the nurturing of each member’s career through business education, lec-
tures and forums for the exchange of ideas and advice, acquiring employ-
ment for perspective members, family budgeting and more; 
3. the opportunity to talk with peers monthly about job situations or 
employers to continually improve performance; 
4.  access to problem-solving resources that most workingmen don’t have 
in today’s world; 
5. access to advice, know-how and encouragement from businessmen who 
are members of the Hindu Businessmen’s Association for any employee 
who plans to begin his own business.  
Two Other
ImportantAgencies472 ¶There are two other very important agencies among 
our Church missions: the Hindu Student’s Association and 
the Râjarâja Chola Gurukulam. The Hindu Student’s Asso ci-
ation follows the general pattern of the Hindu Workingmen’s Association in 
its structure and meeting procedures. The Râjarâja Chola Gurukulam is a 
woman-based agency that functions along the lines of a small private school. 
The Hindu
Student’s Association473 ¶I inaugurated the Hindu Student’s Association  (HSA) 
in 1995 as a forum for our young Church members, from 
the earliest school age to age 19, both boys and girls, to 
gather, discuss issues of concern and perform karma yoga  projects. They 
also plan occasional outings for education and recreation, such as to tem-
ples, state parks, museums and libraries. They hold regular meetings the 
first Sunday of each month, and more often as needed, sitting in chakravâ-
la. Like the HBA and HWA, an HSA can be formed among the members 
of one mission, or among two or more missions that are close enough 
geographically for convenient meetings. T o each gathering the students 
invite one kulapati family to attend as chaperones. The chaperone(s) sit at 
the end of the circle, to the right of the student tûtuvar .  A period of 10 to 
20 minutes is scheduled on the agenda during which the chaperones are

10. Understand how the boss looks at you and your job. 
11.  Find ways to implement your boss’s directions and resist the urge to 
convince him of alternatives you prefer. 
12. Never belittle or criticize your boss behind his back. 
13. Take responsibility yourself. Don’t lean on your boss to make your 
work easier or to solve your problems. 
14. If your boss gives you something to do, don’t transfer it to someone else 
without permission. 
15. Be honest and forthright with employers, never deceitful or cunning. 
16. Regard your employer’s business interests as if they were your own. 
17. Work with your employer as an ally, not an adversary.  
Other
Purposes ofThe HW A470 ¶ 1. The third purpose of the HWA is to improve atti-
tudes and job performance. This is catalyzed by sharing 
personal testimony as an integral part of each HWA meet-
ing. T opics include: a) progress reports; b) ways to improve job skills and 
earn promotions through additional training, reading and guest speakers; c) solving problems, discussing difficult situations or relationships; d) dis-cussing how to earn one’s wages by increasing company profits.
 
2. The HWA’s fourth purpose is to sponsor each month the distribution of 
The Master Course trilogy books to religious organizations, religious lead-
ers and libraries worldwide. This service is financed by monthly dues and other approved fund-raising activities.
 
3. The fifth purpose of the HWA is to further Hindu solidarity by helping 
wherever needed to promote, preserve and protect the Hindu Dharma.

Purposes ofThe HW A470 ¶ 1. The third purpose of the HWA is to improve atti-
tudes and job performance. This is catalyzed by sharing 
personal testimony as an integral part of each HWA meet-
ing. T opics include: a) progress reports; b) ways to improve job skills and 
earn promotions through additional training, reading and guest speakers; c) solving problems, discussing difficult situations or relationships; d) dis-cussing how to earn one’s wages by increasing company profits.
 
2. The HWA’s fourth purpose is to sponsor each month the distribution of 
The Master Course trilogy books to religious organizations, religious lead-
ers and libraries worldwide. This service is financed by monthly dues and other approved fund-raising activities.
 
3. The fifth purpose of the HWA is to further Hindu solidarity by helping 
wherever needed to promote, preserve and protect the Hindu Dharma.

Râjarâja
CholaGurukulams474 ¶All our Church family groups are encouraged to 
establish a Râjarâja Chola Gurukulam  in their mission or 
among two or more missions. The pattern of these schools 
is simple: the qualified women of the mission provide religious and secu-
lar education to the children. Girls may attend through grade 12 (form 6). 
Boys may attend through grade nine (form 3). T eaching methods and atti-
tudes are loosely modeled after the Montessori method, devised in 1907 by 
Maria Montessori, which emphasizes sensitive guidance rather than rigid 
control of the child’s activity, so as to encourage self-education. The train-
ing given in our gurukulams is when possible officially certified by the 
state through the use of already-existing home-study programs with a cur-
riculum of study and primary textbooks. Classes are held in family homes 
that meet mission house standards, or at one of our monasteries in areas 
designated by the Pî†ham. At this time we have two such schools, one on 
Kauai and one in Concord, California. We established this Íaivite home-
study program in 1980 under the name Indo-American Íaivite Schools, 
later adopted the name Râjarâja Chola Gurukulam when we began teach-

the least senior to his right as tûtuvar,  and all others to his left. During the 
meeting, the ma†havâsis fulfill the duties of the seats they hold, but these 
duties rarely continue outside the meeting. The ma†havâsis do not stay 
throughout the meeting in most cases. They are there to give darßana  and 
possibly a spiritual discourse relevant to the occasion. 
About the

refinements that are traditionally followed to keep the 
prâ∫as of this student-teacher relationship flowing per-

and deep inner feelings of belonging, be it to a spiritual lineage, a family 
tradition, school or college. 
There is no one greater in the three worlds than the guru. It is he who grants 
divine knowledge and should be worshiped with supreme devotion.
Atharva Veda, Yoga–ShikhaU 5.53. YT, 26
The disciple who desires to see the guru happy should not visit him empty-
handed, since the guru is a person to be adored like a king. Hence, fruits, 
flowers and betel leaves should be offered first to the guru at the time of 
worship. The disciple may be a virtuous worshiper and a learned knower 
of the scriptures, and he may belong to the culture family, yet he should 
unhesitatingly bow down to the guru. Of all the etiquettes, two are praised 
the most. One is sweet words, and the other is bowing down. All other 
etiquettes are considered meaningless.

When with the satguru, devotees do not initiate  conversation or ask ques-

sage, the pure nectar from the deep well of his ineffable attainment. Aum.
15.  SËTRA 255, ON NOT LISTENING TO CRITICISM OF THE SATGURU
Íiva’s devotees never listen to criticism of their satguru. If  slander is heard, 
they extol the guru and warn the trespasser of his encroachment. If he 
persists in ignorance, they leave in eloquent silence. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.
Darßana
Of theSatguru481 ¶The following Natchintanai  by my satguru, Sage 
Y ogaswâmî, and the many other songs he sang in praise of 
his satguru,  Chellappaswâmî, demonstrate the essence of 
these attitudes, which is a profound bhakti that comes with the knowledge 
of the satguru’s true nature. “ Darßana of the guru  is the blessing of all 
wealth. Daily give worship to his feet. Then you will know yourself, and 
your heart will be filled with peace. Darßana of the guru  is the blessing 
of all wealth. Daily give worship to his feet. Abounding love will over-
flow. Ignorance will be consumed. All likes and dislikes by themselves 
will leave and disappear. Darßana of the guru  is the blessing of all wealth. 
Daily give worship to his feet. The scripture’s law and meaning with your 
thought will correspond. Attachment’s bonds will fall away, and you will 
experience love. Darßana of the guru  is the blessing of all wealth. Daily 
give worship to his feet. The host of Gods and devas will come to do your 
service. That jîva is Íiva is the truth you will clearly recognize. Darßana of 
the guru  is the blessing of all wealth. Daily give worship to his feet.”  
How to
Receive theHoly Guru 482 ¶When the guru visits any family home, of members 
or nonmembers, the event should be regarded as the Deity’s 
visit. It is not a social call. So that devotees can take full 
advantage of the guru ’s presence, treating and receiving him in the tradi-
tional manner, we here provide a few simple guidelines, refined and subtle 
customs from the ancient religious Íaiva culture. When the guru arrives 
at one’s home, it is an occasion of great joy. Everyone rushes forward to 
greet him. He is customarily received and welcomed with garlands at the 
entrance of the property. Upon arriving at the home or other destination, 
the guru is invited to stand before a small temporary outdoor altar that 
has been set up in advance with a kuttuvilaku  (standing oil lamp) and

Darßana
Of theSatguru481 ¶The following Natchintanai  by my satguru, Sage 
Y ogaswâmî, and the many other songs he sang in praise of 
his satguru,  Chellappaswâmî, demonstrate the essence of 
these attitudes, which is a profound bhakti that comes with the knowledge 
of the satguru’s true nature. “ Darßana of the guru  is the blessing of all 
wealth. Daily give worship to his feet. Then you will know yourself, and 
your heart will be filled with peace. Darßana of the guru  is the blessing 
of all wealth. Daily give worship to his feet. Abounding love will over-
flow. Ignorance will be consumed. All likes and dislikes by themselves 
will leave and disappear. Darßana of the guru  is the blessing of all wealth. 
Daily give worship to his feet. The scripture’s law and meaning with your 
thought will correspond. Attachment’s bonds will fall away, and you will 
experience love. Darßana of the guru  is the blessing of all wealth. Daily 
give worship to his feet. The host of Gods and devas will come to do your 
service. That jîva is Íiva is the truth you will clearly recognize. Darßana of 
the guru  is the blessing of all wealth. Daily give worship to his feet.”  
How to
Receive theHoly Guru 482 ¶When the guru visits any family home, of members 
or nonmembers, the event should be regarded as the Deity’s 
visit. It is not a social call. So that devotees can take full 
advantage of the guru ’s presence, treating and receiving him in the tradi-
tional manner, we here provide a few simple guidelines, refined and subtle 
customs from the ancient religious Íaiva culture. When the guru arrives 
at one’s home, it is an occasion of great joy. Everyone rushes forward to 
greet him. He is customarily received and welcomed with garlands at the 
entrance of the property. Upon arriving at the home or other destination, 
the guru is invited to stand before a small temporary outdoor altar that 
has been set up in advance with a kuttuvilaku  (standing oil lamp) and 
a kumbha (water pot with a coconut nestled atop mango leaves) repre-

The Asian
Custom ofTouching Feet 484 ¶As stated in sûtra 221, “  All Íiva’s devotees  pros-
trate before their  satguru,  rev erently touch the  feet of his 
âchâryas and  swâmîs,  and greet yogîs and  sâdhakas with 
their  palms pressed to gether and head slightly bowed. This is tradition. 
Aum.” What is the proper way to touch the feet of one’s guru, or a swâmî? 
T o this question I have given the following answer in Book One of Íaivite 
Hindu Religion. Though written for children, it applies equally to those of 
all ages, “We lovingly touch the feet of our saints and elder relatives when 
we meet them. We do this to receive their blessings and be one with them. 
Y ou first take your shoes or sandals off. Y ou approach with hands together 
in añjali mudrâ. Y ou reach down and gently place your hands fully upon 
both feet and lovingly bend the fingers around them. As you hold the feet, 
take God’s energy within them into you. Then touch your hands to your 
eyes, and smile while looking into their face. They will feel your love and 
sincerity. They will bless and protect you.” As explained in Loving Ga∫eßa, 
“One touches the feet of holy men and women in recognition of their great 
humility and inner attainment. A dancer or a musician touches the feet of his or her teacher before each lesson. Children prostrate and touch the feet 
of their mother and father at special times, such as New Y ear’s day, birth-days and before parting for a journey.”
Protocol for
The GivingOf Vibhûti 485 ¶The Guru Mahâsannidhânam giving vibhûti, sacred 
ash, may place it on the forehead of the devotee and/or in 
the hand. Swâmîs, yogîs  and sâdhakas giving vibhûti place 
it in the hand of the devotee, without physical contact. In giving holy ash 
to small babies, they place it in the hands of the parent to apply.  
Meals for
Guru andMa†havâsis486 ¶Generally the guru  is served his meals  separately 
with the monks who accompany him. But in some cases 
he may request that he, the monastics with him, family 
and friends all be served together. In cases where the guru is leading a 
band of pilgrims, the traditional way is for all to be fed together, and this 
feeding is known as Maheßvara Pûjâ.  Otherwise, meals should be served 
in the home shrine or another private, serene area, with no one standing 
around watching and with no pictures being taken. Meals should be taken 
seated on the floor rather than at a table, and all service should be per-
formed by the men of the house, as stated above. The object is to duplicate 
the conditions at Kauai Aadheenam as closely as possible. My monastics 
must remember that five and ideally six hours must pass before a full 
senting Lord Ga∫eßa. The kumbha water is used later during the pâdapûjâ . 
Åratî is performed (generally by the women) in which a camphor flame is 
passed before the guru , worshiping and welcoming him into the home as 
Íiva Himself. The flame is not offered to the devotees at this time. The guru 
is then led inside the house to a special chair for a pâdapûjâ  (always per-
formed by the senior male of the home, assisted by helpers) . Alternatively, 
the pâdapûjâ  may be held on the veranda. At the end of the pûjâ, âratî is 
again performed, and this time the camphor flame is offered to the devo-
tees present. Then each devotee comes before the guru to prostrate and 
place flowers on his feet. After all have come forward, the guru  is asked 
for his upadesha, and he then speaks to all present, often allowing them to 
ask any questions they may have.  Receptions  can be simple or extremely 
elaborate, with conches blowing, music playing, drums and nagasvâram, 
with the guru being welcomed to the property onto a carpet of new, hand-
made, handwoven cloth, with young girls on both sides offering handfuls 
of flower petals to create a bed of blossoms for him to walk on. Parades, 
processions through the streets, with bushels of flowers showered from bal-
conies, these are some of the ways the madly devout honor the holy guru.
Receiving 
The Guru’s Disciples483 ¶A similar protocol is followed when one of our 
ma†havâsis visits a home. He is received at the entrance, 
where a kuttuvilaku (standing oil lamp) and kumbha have 
been set up as a temporary shrine. F or visiting âchâryas and swâmîs, a 
simple foot bathing is performed at the door before they enter the home. 
The kumbha water is used to bathe his feet while he is standing, but no for-
mal pâdapûjâ is performed. Åratî is passed before the ma†havâsi, and he is 
taken inside the home. Yogîs and sâdhakas visiting are received with âratî, 
but no foot-washing. It is proper for devotees to touch the feet of swâmîs in 
orange , but not those of yogîs  in yellow or sâdhakas in white . Full prostra-
tion is reserved for one’s guru . A swâmî  in orange is invited to sit and give 
upadesha and answer questions. If more than one swâmî  is visiting, the 
eldest is the spokesman. Yogîs and sâdhakas  are not asked to give upade-
sha, but to conduct Natchintanai tirukuttam , inspired singing and to give 
a reading from the lesson of the day (as described in paragraph 496). All 
ma†ha vâsi guests should be invited to share with the group any messages 
or teachings  they may have from the Pî†ham . Guru,  âchâryas, swâmîs, yogîs 
and sâdhakas visit the home shrine and perform âratî before partaking of 
prasâda. Ma†havâsis are served their meals , by the men, separately from 
the family, usually in the shrine room. When visiting a family home, trans-

have a private room with a door. Meals may be served in that room or in 
the shrine or other private area apart from the family, according to the 
guidelines described above. Of course, all service from the family is per-
formed by males, as stated in sûtra 348: “My Íaiva monastics are all males, 
our ancient tradition ordains. When they visit homes, temples or  âßramas,  
all service to them, such as  meals, travel assistance, laundry and visitor 
hosting, shall be carried out by males. Aum.” 
Standards
For TakingMeals 489 ¶ In the case of traditional Hindu homes that other-
wise meet mission house standards but where not all resi-
dents are Church members or even Íaivites, the guru and 
his ma†havâsis may visit and take meals , but not stay overnight. This is 
expressed in sûtra 349: “My Íaiva monastics when traveling may partake of 
food prepared at home by devout families and delivered to them. They may 
also cook for themselves, or enjoy meals in res taurants, whether served by 
men or women. Aum.” In general it would be rare for the monks to eat in 
the home of a noninitiated, non-Church member, and then it would be only 
for the purpose of offering upadesha, which turns the home into the guru’s 
âßrama while they are there. Should nonmembers inquire sincerely and 
repeatedly, we can respond by letting them know that this would be most 
unusual and would require strict and precise protocols to be observed. If 
they persist in their invitation, we can share with them the requirements 
listed below. These rules do not apply to âsramas  or other institutions.
1.  The home must be a strongly Hindu home, decorated with Hindu motifs, 
symbols and artifacts. 
2.  It must be a purely vegetarian home where no meat, fish, fowl, shellfish 
or eggs are ever served to humans. 
3.  It must be a home in which the wife does not work in the world. 
4.  The family must be able to greet the guru or his monastics with the 
protocol described in these ßâstras. Most especially, for a visit by the guru, 
a full pâdapûjâ must be performed by the head of the house. The monks 
traveling with the guru can help and guide, but should not actually per-
form the pûjâ. In this and other situations where the guru and ma†havâsis 
are received, seats for each should be prearranged, with the guru seated 
above all others and ma†havâsis to his left, in order of seniority. 
5.  No visits should be made to a home where the family is on a personal 
meal is again taken, though if prasâda is served in the meantime, taking 
three small bites is permissible. “We have already eaten, but I will have 
just a taste,” is a polite way of demuring from excessive intake of food, 
which is necessary to keep up one’s health while traveling. This tradi-
tional âyurvedic guideline of allowing sufficient time for proper digestion 
applies not only in homes but on airplanes and in other circumstances. 
Receiving
Other Dignitaries487 ¶When swâmîs of orders other than our own visit 
a fellowship home or dharmaßâla, they are treated with 
the same reverence and respect as described above for 
our own swâmîs. Sûtras 222 and 224 illuminate the proper response to the 
visit of a holy man of any order: “Hearing of a venerated swâmî’s arriv-
al, Íiva’s devotees joyously rush to the outskirts of town to welcome him. 
On his departure, they accompany him there and,  with gifts, money and 
good wishes, bid him farewell. Aum. Íiva’s devotees know that God exists 
equally in all souls but is most apparent in the enlightened master. Thus, 
they  revere their own satguru as  Íiva Himself, but do not worship anyone 
as an incarnation of Íiva. Aum.” Dignitaries and parliamentarians, too, are 
venerated and received with honor, as explained in sûtra 223: “Devout Hin-
dus honor a satguru, a head of state, a  re spected  elder, a learned  scholar, a 
 renunciate or  ascetic of any lineage. Upon his entrance, they stand, rush 
forward, bow appropriately and offer kind words. Aum.” Prostration is reserved for one’s own satguru , as stated in sûtra 225: “Sincere Íiva devo-
tees never fail to bow down or gently touch the feet of a satguru or holy 
person of any  order dressed in monastic robes. They prostrate only to their 
own satguru. This is the tradition. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.”  
Standards for
OvernightingIn Homes 488 ¶Sûtra 347 states that my monastics while traveling 
may stay in the homes of initiated fellowship families in 
good standing and their stay must not exceed three nights. 
I would like to elaborate on the qualifications that must be met in order for my monastics to overnight in homes of initiated fellowship members 
by saying that such homes must meet our “mission-house standards.” Fur-
thermore, my monastics must not overnight in a home where the family is 
on personal retreat because of birth or death in the family, nor during the 
monthly retreat of a woman of the household, nor in which anyone has 
in juries that are in the process of healing (up until there is no more danger 
of infection). The general protocol for the Guru Mahâsannidhânam  and 
ma†havâsis for overnight stays is a simple reception with âratî and (for 
swâmîs) foot bathing at the door or pâdapûjâ  for the guru  when appropri-

1.  The home must be a strongly Hindu home, decorated with Hindu motifs, 
symbols and artifacts. 
2.  It must be a purely vegetarian home where no meat, fish, fowl, shellfish 
or eggs are ever served to humans. 
3.  It must be a home in which the wife does not work in the world. 
4.  The family must be able to greet the guru or his monastics with the 
protocol described in these ßâstras. Most especially, for a visit by the guru, 
a full pâdapûjâ must be performed by the head of the house. The monks 
traveling with the guru can help and guide, but should not actually per-
form the pûjâ. In this and other situations where the guru and ma†havâsis 
are received, seats for each should be prearranged, with the guru seated 
above all others and ma†havâsis to his left, in order of seniority. 
5.  No visits should be made to a home where the family is on a personal 
meal is again taken, though if prasâda is served in the meantime, taking 
three small bites is permissible. “We have already eaten, but I will have 
just a taste,” is a polite way of demuring from excessive intake of food, 
which is necessary to keep up one’s health while traveling. This tradi-
tional âyurvedic guideline of allowing sufficient time for proper digestion 
applies not only in homes but on airplanes and in other circumstances. 
Receiving
Other Dignitaries487 ¶When swâmîs of orders other than our own visit 
a fellowship home or dharmaßâla, they are treated with 
the same reverence and respect as described above for 
our own swâmîs. Sûtras 222 and 224 illuminate the proper response to the 
visit of a holy man of any order: “Hearing of a venerated swâmî’s arriv-
al, Íiva’s devotees joyously rush to the outskirts of town to welcome him. 
On his departure, they accompany him there and,  with gifts, money and 
good wishes, bid him farewell. Aum. Íiva’s devotees know that God exists 
equally in all souls but is most apparent in the enlightened master. Thus, 
they  revere their own satguru as  Íiva Himself, but do not worship anyone 
as an incarnation of Íiva. Aum.” Dignitaries and parliamentarians, too, are 
venerated and received with honor, as explained in sûtra 223: “Devout Hin-
dus honor a satguru, a head of state, a  re spected  elder, a learned  scholar, a 
 renunciate or  ascetic of any lineage. Upon his entrance, they stand, rush 
forward, bow appropriately and offer kind words. Aum.” Prostration is reserved for one’s own satguru , as stated in sûtra 225: “Sincere Íiva devo-
tees never fail to bow down or gently touch the feet of a satguru or holy 
person of any  order dressed in monastic robes. They prostrate only to their 
own satguru. This is the tradition. Aum Nama˙ Íivâya.”  
Standards for
OvernightingIn Homes 488 ¶Sûtra 347 states that my monastics while traveling 
may stay in the homes of initiated fellowship families in 
good standing and their stay must not exceed three nights. 
I would like to elaborate on the qualifications that must be met in order for my monastics to overnight in homes of initiated fellowship members 
by saying that such homes must meet our “mission-house standards.” Fur-
thermore, my monastics must not overnight in a home where the family is 
on personal retreat because of birth or death in the family, nor during the 
monthly retreat of a woman of the household, nor in which anyone has 
in juries that are in the process of healing (up until there is no more danger 
of infection). The general protocol for the Guru Mahâsannidhânam  and 
ma†havâsis for overnight stays is a simple reception with âratî and (for 
swâmîs) foot bathing at the door or pâdapûjâ  for the guru  when appropri-

Planning forDarßana Visits493 ¶When a visit is planned, it is the responsibility of 
the council on missions of the mission or missions in the 
area to assist in arranging the schedule, including helping 
to choose qualified homes for visitation, meals  and overnight stays, and 
then making sure that designated families are fully prepared to fulfill their duties according to the protocol. Ideally, before any overnight stay, 
lecture, or home visit, a printed card stating the requirements for the 
given situation should be reviewed with the head of the house and a copy 
left with him for reference to our protocol. Before the visit, the monastics 
or their hosts should discreetly inquire if the requirements have been met. 
One final instruction: it is imperative that, in any type of visit, the family 
never leave the guru or his ma†havâsis alone in the home with the women 
of the house unaccompanied by an adult male of the family. This violation of tradition should not occur for any reason. If the men of the family must 
leave because of emergency reasons, then the ma†havâsis  must depart 
with them and find another place to stay. 
Paramaguru
Yogaswâmî’sExample494 ¶Satguru Y ogaswâmî set an important pattern in the 
Jaffna Peninsula during his more than fifty years as spiri-
tual monarch of the nation. During his frequent travels 
around the island he visited only certain select homes, numbering about 
twenty-one, I was told. He stayed  overnight only in bachelor homes. He 
worked closely with these trusted families and trained them in indirect ways through his spontaneous visits. During his stay overnight or for a 
simple meal or cup of tea he would sing impromptu devotional songs, 
original compositions containing gems of Nâtha wisdom, and these would 
be written down by the devotees. Over time, hundreds of songs were gener-
ated and eventually gathered together as the Natchintanai. Devotees never 
knew when he would arrive, so they prepared food for him each day and 
always had a place ready for him to stay, often a special room set aside for 
his use alone. It was by carefully training this handful of close ßishyas 
over a period of many years that he was able to uplift the entire country . 
Selecting
Homes toVisit495 ¶Similarly, my monastics should realize that when 
they go to an area to  minister to our Church family commu-
nity, and are instructed to visit or overnight with kulapati 
families, they should not feel obligated to visit all the kulapati homes. The 
first choice would be the mission house because that is dedicated to me 
as my âßrama. The second choice would be the home of the talaivar of 
the council on missions, then those holding the positions of the council 
retreat because of birth or death in the family, or during the monthly retreat of a woman of the household, or during the retreat of an individual 
with injuries in the process of healing as mentioned above. 
Food 
PreparationAnd Service 490 ¶Families who wish to cook meals (lunch or dinner 
but never breakfast) for the guru and his ma†havâsis dur-
ing their travels may prepare these at home and bring 
them to the hotel. But whether brought to a hotel or served in a home, all 
annadâna , or meals offered my monks or myself should be prepared with 
the following restrictions. It must be prepared with no oils, though ghee is 
allowable, using pots and utensils that have never been used for cooking 
meat. Fried foods should be avoided, though pappadams and other delica-
cies, such as peppers or vadai, may occasionally be served if fried in ghee 
(used for the first time). No white sugar should be used in the preparation 
of foods or beverages. Raw sugar and honey are acceptable. Food should 
be served freshly cooked and hot, not lukewarm or cold, as such food 
is unhealthy and may be contaminated. In summary, food is prepared 
according to the âyurvedic standards described in the sûtras of Living with 
Íiva on diet and food. Departure generally happens soon after the meal. 
Departure
After Home Visits491 ¶Dakshi∫â, a monetary love offering,  is traditionally 
given by everyone present at all types of visits, generally 
when coming forward for vibhûti prasâda, not only from 
the host, who presents his dakshi∫â  on a beautiful tray of fruit and other 
special offerings, such as incense, ginger powder and sweets, just before 
the ma†havâsis  depart. The children are taught in this way by their par-
ents to give a small offering to the ma†havâsis , thus training the younger 
generation to care for the many swâmî orders of the planet. 
Hindu 
Solidarity Courtesy Calls 492 ¶Oftentimes the Guru Mahâsannidhânam and his 
ma†havâsis will make Hindu solidarity courtesy calls  to 
non-Íaiva religious temples, groups and institutions during 
travel-pilgrimages. For example, in recent years I have made courtesy calls to many temples and religious leaders of the Íâkta, Smârta and V aish∫ava 
denominations of Hinduism, attended numerous ecumenical gatherings and visited the homes and gathering places of leaders of such noble indig-enous tribes as the Hopis of Arizona, the Mauris of New Zealand and the 
Aborigines of Australia. During such encounters, our protocol necessarily 
is relaxed, and we endeavor to blend harmoniously with the customs of 
our hosts, all within the guidelines of wisdom and propriety. Meals may 
be shared in such settings, though rarely in private homes.

Guidelines
For Brief Home Visits498 ¶The guidelines for brief visits to  homes where no 
meals are to be taken are much more lenient. Drop-in visits  
are generally from 20 to 30 minutes and no longer than one 
hour. The flow of such a visit is as follows. The guru or ma†havâsis are 
greeted at the door in traditional style, which can be as simple as an âratî 
and, for guru and swâmîs  (but not for yogîs or sâdhakas), a foot washing. 
They visit the shrine and, if qualified, the elder of the group gives a short 
upadesha.  They enjoy a sip of tea or other beverage and a simple snack, 
but no meal, served in the living room, not the dining room. Then they 
take their leave. But the ultimate example was given in Kopai, Sri Lanka, 
for Gurudeva in 1981 when there was a magnificent parade. Each family 
along the way prayed that he would stop and step into their home for just an instant, which in numerous homes he did, and was received with sim-
ple foot washing, âratî  and garland, all in less than five minutes. And it is 
not untraditional that all this happen outside the home, with the motor 
running, without ever setting foot  inside the home. 
About
Staying inHotels499 ¶People sometimes ask why ma†havâsis of our order 
stay in hotels  that do not meet the qualifications of an aver-
age Hindu home or âßrama . The reason is that hotels pro-
vide totally impersonal accommodations. Their room, the coffee shop, res-
taurant and other facilities are their âßrama  while they are there. When in 
hotels for meals or to stay overnight, they do not pay attention to the other 
guests. Nor do they become involved in the personal karma of the servant 
staff, which they avoid by not engaging in unnecessary conversation. Often 
meals are brought there for them by devoted families. Many think of stay-
ing in a hotel as being a worldly matter. But if they could see the psychic 
forces at work, they would have a different opinion. When one goes into 
a family home, there is an immediate contact with the karmas, good and 
bad, of the family, its relatives, business, interpersonal relationships and 
problems, perhaps confided, and for which advice given is rarely followed. 
The effect of the ma†havâsis’ presence  is to intensify those karmas, be they 
positive or negative. This kind of personal karmic involvement is absent 
in a hotel, where people do not reside permanently. There is an imper-
sonalness in a lodge or inn that is not to be found in any home. Avoiding 
undue involvement in family karmas is wise, and it is the reason that our 
on missions’ pechâlar, padipâlar and tûtuvar . Visiting one, two or three 
homes would be totally adequate for a short stay in a particular region. 
Again, it is the duty of the council on ministries to help determine quali-
fied homes for visitation, meals and overnight stays, and to speak with the 
hosts to ensure that our protocol will be fulfilled.
Having a
Program of Teaching496 ¶The object in visiting anyone’s home, even for a 
short time—and indeed, in all encounters with our ßishy-
as, students and seekers—is to teach and uplift through 
darßana, not to socialize. The emphasis is not on listening to problems , 
though Church members may share concerns with my swâmîs— but not 
with yogîs or sâ dhakas. These would tend to come up after the teaching  
is done, during question-and-answer sessions. Some teaching should be 
given, no matter how brief the visit. With this in mind, all ma†havâsis 
on mission should without exception be prepared to give a presentation drawn from and based on the combined lessons of the day . The presenta-
tion should begin with a reading of the day’s scriptural quotes, especially the Vedas, from the chapter of Dancing with Íiva from which the lesson 
is drawn. Then, reading aloud or reciting from memory, the ma†havâsi 
gives a presentation based on the day’s lesson from Dancing with Íiva, 
Living with Íiva and Merging with Íiva. Ma†havâsis with blessings to do 
so may also give a brief discourse on these teachings. After the upadesha , 
a question-and-answer session may be held if time allows and the monk is qualified. If the monk is not qualified, he should say so quite openly and explain that they should consult with the guru or one of the more senior 
ma†havâsis. Similarly, if problems are presented and advice requested, the 
monastic should demure in the same manner, unless he has been given 
specific instructions from the guru  to give advice. 
Teaching
The LessonOf the Day497 ¶In efficiently planning for a journey, pilgrimage or 
visitation, the teaching materials can be arranged as daily 
curriculum and rehearsed along the way after the early-
morning meditation. This pattern of teaching from the combined three 
lessons of the day—from Dancing, Living and Merging with Íiva—  should 
also be followed by the kulapatis  and others giving forth explanation and 
testimony of the teachings through lectures and seminars. All should fol-
low the example  of the great Markanduswâmî , one of Y ogaswâmî’s fore-
most initiates, whom I visited for darßana in 1969, 1972, 1981, 1982 and 1984  
with my ma†havâsis and g®ihasthas. He always taught by saying, “Y oga-

Guru ProtocolConsulting 
Elders forTiming503 ¶When the guru gives blessings, there is a second 
step to be taken. That is to determine the timing of imple-
mentation. In important matters, it is up to the individual 
to discuss the timing with elders  or parents. This is done before the plan 
is implemented. The parents or elders may need to then again confer with 
the guru. When the guru gives his blessings to a young man to start a busi-
ness of building boats, for example, it is up to the youth to seek the wis-
dom of his parents and the Hindu Businessmen’s Association as to when 
the business should be started.
Informing
The CouncilOn Missions504 ¶On matters that concern the entire mission, the 
council on missions  should be informed when the guru 
gives initial blessings for a change or innovation. This is 
done by the kulapati’s informing the talaivar  of the council, who then 
brings the matter up during his next formal communication with the 
Guru Mahâsannidhânam or his representative. The talaivar then brings 
the response and direction to the council at the next formal meeting. It is the duty of the council to nod or not nod, indicating whether they feel the 
innovation is timely or not. If they nod that it is timely, this response is 
taken back to the Pî†ham  by the talaivar . 
Approval by
The Pî†hamAnd the COM505 ¶The Guru Mahâsannidhânam then gives his final 
approval and the astrology is checked for the best tim-
ing to begin. If the council  members do not give their nod, 
meaning it is not timely to begin, that response also is conveyed to the 
guru by the talaivar. The innovation is delayed indefinitely, and may be 
brought up again in the future. It is in this way that changes and innova-
tions are implemented by the monastery senior group of ma†havâsis , to 
protect the vigil of sublimity. For example, when the Pî†ham gives bless-
ings to a kulapati  to start a hospital visitation program in the community, 
it is up to the kulapati to bring the matter up at the next formal council on 
ministries meeting. He informs the talaivar during the appropriate time 
during the meeting that preliminary blessings for the project have been 
received. The talaivar makes careful note of the matter on his agenda. He 
mentions the program during his next communication with the Pî†ham 
and receives the response. He later conveys this to the council on missions. 
Only when this second level of approval is completed is the project initi-
ated. This protocol gives the Guru Mahâsannidhânam the opportunity to consider the matter a second time and set it in motion, or make a different decision, through formal channels.
ma†havâsis generally stay in hotels when traveling, rather than in homes. 
About
Staying inÅßramas500 ¶As stated in sûtra 347: “My Íaiva monastics while 
traveling may reside and take meals in âßramas,  temples, 
hotels or homes of worthy initiated  families of our Saiva 
Siddhanta Church. Their sojourn in homes must never exceed three nights. 
Aum.” Qualifications for âßramas  are as follows: these must be traditional 
âßramas where males reside, and if there are brahmachâri∫îs, they must 
reside in a separate building.
Seeking the
Guru’s Blessings501 ¶For any change or innovation in life it is traditional 
for all members to seek the advice and blessings of their preceptor, as stated in sûtra 246: “Íiva’s devotees seek their 
satguru’s blessings, act in harmony with his will, trust in his supreme 
wisdom, seek refuge in his  grace and rush forward to  re dedicate them-
selves each year during the month of the  guru.  Aum.”  Seeking blessings 
from the guru  is the process of presenting an idea or plan which has been 
clearly thought through and for which a decision has been reached, and asking for his benediction and spiritual support for its fulfillment. Essen-
tially, the ßishya is asking his guru whether or not from his wise point of 
view the plan should be carried out. In seeking blessings, the guru should 
be informed on all aspects of the matter, including how family and other 
concerned parties feel about the proposed innovation. If there is opposi-
tion to the venture, the guru should be informed of it by the ßishya. If 
the proposal is complex, it is best that the ßishya work out all details of 
the plan with his kulapati and other family members, who in turn seek 
advice of elder kulapatis when necessary, before the ßishya comes to the 
guru for blessings. It is also traditional and acceptable to request blessings 
to begin planning an innovation, and to then later present the developed 
plan for final sanction. 
Patiently
Waiting forBlessings 502 ¶ After a matter has been presented to the guru, it is 
the duty of the ßishya to patiently await a response. Silence 
or delay on the part of the guru should never be interpret-
ed as a “yes.” If no response is forthcoming after some time, the ßishya may 
inquire discreetly as to the status of the matter. Once the advice or deci-
sion of the guru  is received and understood, the devotee is bound by spiri-
tual law to accept and follow it.  Sûtra 248 admonishes: “Íiva’s devotees 
trustingly heed their satguru’s counsel without even subtly attempting to 
change his mind. If he declines to give blessings for an endeavor, they ac cept that as his blessing and proceed no further. Aum.”

Guru ProtocolConsulting 
Elders forTiming503 ¶When the guru gives blessings, there is a second 
step to be taken. That is to determine the timing of imple-
mentation. In important matters, it is up to the individual 
to discuss the timing with elders  or parents. This is done before the plan 
is implemented. The parents or elders may need to then again confer with 
the guru. When the guru gives his blessings to a young man to start a busi-
ness of building boats, for example, it is up to the youth to seek the wis-
dom of his parents and the Hindu Businessmen’s Association as to when 
the business should be started.
Informing
The CouncilOn Missions504 ¶On matters that concern the entire mission, the 
council on missions  should be informed when the guru 
gives initial blessings for a change or innovation. This is 
done by the kulapati’s informing the talaivar  of the council, who then 
brings the matter up during his next formal communication with the 
Guru Mahâsannidhânam or his representative. The talaivar then brings 
the response and direction to the council at the next formal meeting. It is the duty of the council to nod or not nod, indicating whether they feel the 
innovation is timely or not. If they nod that it is timely, this response is 
taken back to the Pî†ham  by the talaivar . 
Approval by
The Pî†hamAnd the COM505 ¶The Guru Mahâsannidhânam then gives his final 
approval and the astrology is checked for the best tim-
ing to begin. If the council  members do not give their nod, 
meaning it is not timely to begin, that response also is conveyed to the 
guru by the talaivar. The innovation is delayed indefinitely, and may be 
brought up again in the future. It is in this way that changes and innova-
tions are implemented by the monastery senior group of ma†havâsis , to 
protect the vigil of sublimity. For example, when the Pî†ham gives bless-
ings to a kulapati  to start a hospital visitation program in the community, 
it is up to the kulapati to bring the matter up at the next formal council on 
ministries meeting. He informs the talaivar during the appropriate time 
during the meeting that preliminary blessings for the project have been 
received. The talaivar makes careful note of the matter on his agenda. He 
mentions the program during his next communication with the Pî†ham 
and receives the response. He later conveys this to the council on missions. 
Only when this second level of approval is completed is the project initi-
ated. This protocol gives the Guru Mahâsannidhânam the opportunity to consider the matter a second time and set it in motion, or make a different decision, through formal channels.
ma†havâsis generally stay in hotels when traveling, rather than in homes. 
About
Staying inÅßramas500 ¶As stated in sûtra 347: “My Íaiva monastics while 
traveling may reside and take meals in âßramas,  temples, 
hotels or homes of worthy initiated  families of our Saiva 
Siddhanta Church. Their sojourn in homes must never exceed three nights. 
Aum.” Qualifications for âßramas  are as follows: these must be traditional 
âßramas where males reside, and if there are brahmachâri∫îs, they must 
reside in a separate building.
Seeking the
Guru’s Blessings501 ¶For any change or innovation in life it is traditional 
for all members to seek the advice and blessings of their preceptor, as stated in sûtra 246: “Íiva’s devotees seek their 
satguru’s blessings, act in harmony with his will, trust in his supreme 
wisdom, seek refuge in his  grace and rush forward to  re dedicate them-
selves each year during the month of the  guru.  Aum.”  Seeking blessings 
from the guru  is the process of presenting an idea or plan which has been 
clearly thought through and for which a decision has been reached, and asking for his benediction and spiritual support for its fulfillment. Essen-
tially, the ßishya is asking his guru whether or not from his wise point of 
view the plan should be carried out. In seeking blessings, the guru should 
be informed on all aspects of the matter, including how family and other 
concerned parties feel about the proposed innovation. If there is opposi-
tion to the venture, the guru should be informed of it by the ßishya. If 
the proposal is complex, it is best that the ßishya work out all details of 
the plan with his kulapati and other family members, who in turn seek 
advice of elder kulapatis when necessary, before the ßishya comes to the 
guru for blessings. It is also traditional and acceptable to request blessings 
to begin planning an innovation, and to then later present the developed

ConclusionSummary of
ImplementingBlessings506 ¶In summary, blessings received bring additional 
responsibility to make sure the guru’s thrust in giving 
blessings  is carried out with auspicious timing, with all 
other current tasks and obligations taken into account. Often the astrology 
is consulted to choose the best possible muhûrta. The traditional proce-
dure described above can be summarized as follows: 
1.  A devotee discusses an innovation with the Guru Mahâsannidhânam,  
having previously talked the matter over with elders and received their 
support. He informs the guru of all details of the matter, positive and nega-
tive, and the thoughts of family and other concerned parties. The guru 
may respond immediately or convey his response later. If response is not 
immediate, the devotee waits patiently to hear if the guru approves or not.
2. The guru gives blessings or he does not. If blessings are not given, the 
matter is dropped. 
3.  If blessings are given on a personal matter which does not affect the 
mission members, then the devotee may begin implementation according 
to auspicious timing.
4. If blessings are given on a matter which concerns the mission, or 
requires the mission’s help, the matter is submitted by the devotee to the 
council on missions for a second review and, if the guru’s blessings are 
again given, the council’s nod on timing for implementation. 
5.  A message from the Guru Mahâsannidhânam about the innovation is 
conveyed by the tûtuvar to the devotee who received the initial blessings. 
About the
Preceptor’s Perspective507 ¶The main reason for seeking the guru’s blessings is 
that he perceives from a higher perspective and, knowing the karmic flow of the family, sees farther into their future. 
The guru  has the entire family’s spiritual welfare at heart and takes into 
careful consideration how innovations in the lives of individual members 
will impact the needs of the family as a whole, and the community as well. His point of view is often different from the perspective of the devo-
tee, who is more involved in worldly matters. For these reasons, all mem-
bers seek the blessings of their guru in all important matters. For these 
reasons, heads of extended families the world over seek the advice and 
blessings of their spiritual preceptors within every sect of Hinduism to help guide their family members through the pitfalls of their prârabdha 
karmas.  For these reasons, the family preceptor must be informed of the 
ebb and flow of individual and collective karmas he is responsible to over-
see and be kept informed of any major changes the family plans to make. For these reasons, the guru is an intricate part of each family, guiding and 
observing closely, inwardly from a distance. Enough time must be alloted 
for all decisions to be understood and questions to be asked before bless-
ings are given or not given. Decisions, especially those affecting the entire 
family, must never be rushed into. Therefore, the art of planning ahead is 
very necessary for the success of the individual and the entire family. The 
wise man even plans for that which cannot be planned for.
The Spirit 
Of GenuineObedience508 ¶Though wisdom and tradition oblige the devotee to 
follow the directions the guru  gives, it is not to be a “blind 
obedience,” which is an ignorant approach. The ideal rela-
tionship is an inner state of cooperation with the preceptor’s mind. True 
obedience  is the state of willingness and cooperation in which the soul 
remains open and amenable to enlightened direction. It is an unbroken pledge of trust in the mystic process of spiritual evolution. True obedience, 
or better, intelligent cooperation, is based on knowledge, agreement, love and trust. Therefore, questions should be asked if a direction is not clear.
The initiation for the attainment of liberation can only be obtained from 
the guru. Without the help of the guru no penance could ever be helpful in 
producing the desired result. The guru teaches the pupil. The guru becomes 
the object of glory for the disciple and enhances the pupil’s dignity. Hence the disciple must have immense regard for the guru. The guru is Siva Himself, 
and Siva is called the guru. Whether guru or Siva, both have been accepted 
as vidya . Vidya is not different from both of them.
Chandrajñâna Íaivâgama, Kriyâpâda, Chapter 2, Verse 7
Nandinâtha accepted the offering of my body, wealth and life. 
He then touched me, and his glance dispelled my distressful karma. 
He placed his feet on my head and imparted higher consciousness. 
Thus, he severed my burdensome cycle of birth.

FULFILL THE PROPHECIES OF THREE ÍÅSTRAS THAT PRECED-

the Lemurian Íâstras, Dravidian Íâstras and the Íaivite Íâstras.  It is with

sacred text well set within the âkâßic rule books of the soul.  As we have

final rendering of these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras goes, for the librarian to 
show to yet another race evolving in yet another galaxy a safe distance 
from its Central Sun, perhaps in yet another yuga.  At some future time on 
some planet harboring life as we know it, some great soul will delve into

ConclusionThe Challenge
Faced by OurMissionaries513 ¶Our new group of missionary kulapatis and kula-
mâtâs  have now stepped upon a threshold from where they 
can do great things for Íaivism in their ongoing search for 
Íaiva souls, accepting them into their extended families or thrusting them 
out if they prove insincere. These one-hundred-twenty men and women, 
who have been with us for decades and more, mobilize themselves into 
new mission groups, teach the Íaivite Hindu Religion course, promote H IN-
DUISM  TODAY and The Master Course trilogy, and use their weeky satsa˜ga 
and their monthly havana as forums to discuss how well they are, each 
and all, performing this outreach. We will see in the years to come the 
fulfillment of their dedication. The devonic mentors see into the future 
and predict that this effort will be outstanding, fulfilling, rewarding, and a new generation of Íaivites will come forth from the wombs of the wives 
that will make changes in the communities worldwide, spiritual, social, 
cultural, economic and educational. These of the new generation will be competent to master and reform alien communities, regenerate elders in 
their dharmic duty, harmonize family life within and beyond their own 
homes and strengthen spiritual leadership within their community. This 
charge is a shawl that I wrap around the shoulders of future Íaivites, some 
yet to be born, others who are now living and will be born again under 
this same shawl, and so on, well into the future of futures. 
Our Ultimate
Purpose
Fulfilled514 ¶As we joyfully conclude this intricate work, we are 
reminded of verse 100 of our Íaivite Íâstras: “By the very 
existence of the Íaiva Siddhânta Y oga Order  as a one body, 
it fulfilled its purpose—as the ®ishi  in seclusion, alone in the forest, fulfills 
his purpose in the world by his very existence on the path, as the Deity by His presence on the planet is His own fulfillment. The order persisted 
and continues to persist on into the years to come.” This is the vision.  The 
time, the mission and the way have been cleared: first by the inspiring 
lives of the satgurus of our lineage, then by the revelations of the Lemuri-
an Íâstras, then by the Dravidian Íâstras, then by the Íaivite Íâstras,  then 
by this testimony, this divine edict, the Íaiva Dharma Íâstras,  command-
ing the âchâryas to protect, preserve and perpetuate the patterns given 
herein generation after generation into the many generations to come.  Jai 
to all the sâdhakas. Jai to all the yogîs. Jai to all the swâmîs. Jai to all the 
âchâryas. Jai to the future of futures. On Future
Changes toThese Íâstras510 ¶As I stated in the introduction, each paragraph is 
numbered so that bhâshyas  can be written by future guru 
mahâsannidhânams  to explain and interpret the flows 
given here as times change, for the only rigid rule is wisdom. Up until my grand departure this book is open to my continued additions, changes and 
clarifications. After my mahâsamâdhi,  these Íaiva Dharma Íâstras  will be 
considered the final, irrevocable document upon which all future policy-
making  and interpretation shall be based. All such policy-making shall 
be done by guru mahâsannidhânams. My kulapatis do not participate in 
such decisions, but consider it their sacred blessing to carry them out into 
glorious manifestation. 
Sâdhana and
Service : Our
Dual Emphasis511 ¶My successors are commissioned to sustain and 
implement what has always been the force behind our 
ministry: religious service, Íivaseva, Íivathondu, karma 
yoga. This and only this sacred thrust of the Veda s the âchâryas fortify 
and sustain by their own self-discipline. This and only this they imple-
ment by the administration and encouragement of daily sâdhana among 
the swâmîs, yogîs, sâdhakas, brahmachârîs and g®ihastha devotees. They 
know and teach to one and all that without early morning brâhma 
muhûrta sâdhana,  Íivathondu cannot be done in the right spirit. Without 
it, seva is then a chore to be done for the sake of those who may be looking 
on and might criticize. It is for my successors, the âchâryas of our Íaiva 
Siddhânta Y oga Order, to alert and encourage, coach and insist on this 
and the other sâdhanas given in this text and our primary works: Dancing, 
Living and Merging with Íiva.  
Seeking Pure 
Channels Of Service512 ¶This prodding must be imposed upon only those 
who are time-proven dependable. In this way, by work-
ing through psychically clear channels of responsive, joy-
ous, unobstructed souls—both in the g®ihastha communities and in the 
cloistered monastic communities of the world—and ignoring the others 
through a friendly, firm wall, they prepare for the great energy that is to come. Only in this way will the Íivaseva of the Íaiva âchâryas and of 
those they minister to be totally selfless, unegofied. My close devotees are, 
in the eyes of the Gods, the jewels, the precious gems, the foremost among 
pure channels. They are strengthened by their early morning sâdhana, 
before sunrise, strengthened by their wives, who are not working in the 
world but staying at home for the benefit of the family, strengthened by 
their not smoking or philandering in any way. Homage to Him who 
presides over all things, that which was and that which shall be; to whom alone belongs the heaven, to that all-powerful Brahman be homage! From Fullness He pours forth the full; the full spreads, merging with the full. We eagerly would know from whence He thus replen-ishes Himself.

such decisions, but consider it their sacred blessing to carry them out into 
glorious manifestation. 
Sâdhana and
Service : Our
Dual Emphasis511 ¶My successors are commissioned to sustain and 
implement what has always been the force behind our 
ministry: religious service, Íivaseva, Íivathondu, karma 
yoga. This and only this sacred thrust of the Veda s the âchâryas fortify 
and sustain by their own self-discipline. This and only this they imple-
ment by the administration and encouragement of daily sâdhana among 
the swâmîs, yogîs, sâdhakas, brahmachârîs and g®ihastha devotees. They 
know and teach to one and all that without early morning brâhma 
muhûrta sâdhana,  Íivathondu cannot be done in the right spirit. Without 
it, seva is then a chore to be done for the sake of those who may be looking 
on and might criticize. It is for my successors, the âchâryas of our Íaiva 
Siddhânta Y oga Order, to alert and encourage, coach and insist on this 
and the other sâdhanas given in this text and our primary works: Dancing, 
Living and Merging with Íiva.  
Seeking Pure 
Channels Of Service512 ¶This prodding must be imposed upon only those 
who are time-proven dependable. In this way, by work-
ing through psychically clear channels of responsive, joy-
ous, unobstructed souls—both in the g®ihastha communities and in the 
cloistered monastic communities of the world—and ignoring the others 
through a friendly, firm wall, they prepare for the great energy that is to come. Only in this way will the Íivaseva of the Íaiva âchâryas and of 
those they minister to be totally selfless, unegofied. My close devotees are, 
in the eyes of the Gods, the jewels, the precious gems, the foremost among 
pure channels. They are strengthened by their early morning sâdhana, 
before sunrise, strengthened by their wives, who are not working in the 
world but staying at home for the benefit of the family, strengthened by 
their not smoking or philandering in any way. Homage to Him who 
presides over all things, that which was and that which shall be; to whom alone belongs the heaven, to that all-powerful Brahman be homage! From Fullness He pours forth the full; the full spreads, merging with the full. We eagerly would know from whence He thus replen-ishes Himself.

Conclusion
3ANNY SA MAY BE SIMPLY DE-
fined as êaivite Hindu monas-ticism, and a UCPP[jUKP is one 
who has renounced the world 
in search of God Realization and has been formally initiated by a IWTW who 
is himself a UCPP[jUKP . In Sansk¨it the 
word ©UCPP[jUCª literally means Òto 
throw downÓ or Òto abandon.Ó Thus, UCP
P[jUC is the giving up or abandonment 
of the world, and the UCPP[jUKP is one 
who has so renounced. True UCPP[jUC is 
not a denial of life but lifeÕs highest ful-Þllment. It is unmitigated selßessness. It is the relinquishment of the transient and illusory in favor of a permanent Reality, the eschewing of a worldly life that one may, by gradual stages of pur-ification, draw inward toward God as Para§iva, Truth Absolute. It is a break with the mundane and a binding unto the Divine. It is the repudiation of the FJCTOC , including the obligations and 
duties, of the householder and the ac-ceptance of the even more demanding FJCTOC  of the renunciate. The seasoned 
UCPP[jUKP is truly the liberated man, 
the spiritual exemplar, the disciplined [QIu and ultimately the knower of Truth, 
freed to commune with the Divine and bound to uplift humanity through the sharing of his wisdom, his peace, his devotion and his illumination, howev-er great or small. The UCPP[jUKP is the 
guardian of his religion, immersed in it, constantly freed from worldliness, freed 
from distraction, able to offer his work and his worship in unbroken continu-ity and one-pointed effectiveness. He undertakes certain disciplines includ-ing the puriÞcation of body, mind and emotions. He restrains and controls the mind through his UjFJCPC , VCRCU and 
meditative regimen. He unfolds from within himself a profound love of God and the Gods. His practice of WRjUCPj  
or worship is predominantly internal, seeking God êiva within. ¦In the êai-va tradition there have always existed among men a few, rare in numbers but mighty in their dedication to Lord êiva, for whom the world held no attraction and MCTOCU were on the wane. Such 
men are by nature inclined toward knowledge of God and disinclined to-ward desires of family, wealth and property, also spoken of by our spiritual forefathers as women, gold and land. Some among them are UjFJWU , anchor-
ites living in the seclusion of distant caves and remote forests or wandering as homeless mendicants, itinerant pil-grims to the holy sanctuaries of êaivism. Others dwell as cenobites assembled with their brothers, often in the jTCOC
CCFJGGPCO or OCJC of their UCVIWTW
but always under the IWTW¬U  aegis, serv-
ing together in fulÞllment of a common mission. These devotees, when initiated into the order of UCPP[jUC , don the saf-THE FOLLOWING IS A RELIGIOUS COVENANT BETWEEN A SANNY SINÑONE W HO

fron robes and thereby bind themselves 
to a universal body of Hindu renunci-ates whose existence has never ceased, an assembly of men inwardly linked in êivasambandham, their mutual dedica-tion to êiva, though not necessarily out-wardly associated. It is this venerable convocation which the UCPP[jUKP joins 
and to which he is bound for life in brotherhood and in service. ¦Tradition-ally, there are several levels of initiation for the êaivite monastic. Requirements and qualiÞcations vary according to the circumstances, the preceptor and the disciple. These initiations may be given early in the monasticÕs life or may await the completion of years or even decades of UjFJCPC  and puriÞcation before they 
are bestowed. It is not a matter of tem-poral experience or timing. The Þrst for-mal initiation for the aspirant is known as DTCJOCEJCT[CFuMUJj and enters the 
devotee into a chaste life of study, wor-ship and service. The next initiation is that of UCPP[jUCFuMUJj . This FuMUJj  is a 
formal Hindu rite, or less often an infor-mal blessing, entering the devotee into renunciate monasticism, binding him for life to certain vows which include chastity, poverty and obedience, and directing him on the path to God Real-ization. It must be realized that the cer-emonies described in the Rites of Initia-tion section herein form the customary rites of passage into UCPP[jUC but that 
it is not merely the observance of these ordinances which makes one a UCPP[j
UKP. Indeed, if not a single formality was 
followed, not a single vow solemnized, a true UCVIWTW may confer UCPP[jUC on 
a true disciple in a most informal man-ner. There are other forms of FuMUJj , not 
relating to monasticism, by which a spiritual teacher bestows blessings and 
awakening upon the devotee through the simple agency of a touch, word, look or thought. One such initiation is known as OCPVTCFuMUJj , which in the êaiva tradi-
tion is the teaching of the Pachkshara Mantra, ÒNamaú êivya.Ó ¦According to the venerable laws of Manu, one enters into UCPP[jUC after training with the 
IWTW but only if the candidate received 
DTCJOCEJCT[CFuMUJj  and commenced 
such training prior to his twenty-fifth birthday. Otherwise, all are expected to enter the life of the householder, em-bracing the life of renunciation, if they elect, after having concluded family and societal obligations around age seventy-two. Thus, there are two distinct types of UCPP[jUC . The Þrst is initiation of un-
married youth into the ancient world Order of UCPP[jUC . A second UCPP[jUC , 
described in the 8GFCU though not com-
monly observed in contemporary Hindu society, may be deÞned as the last of the four jTCOCU or stages of life. After ob-

3ANNY SA MAY BE SIMPLY DE-
fined as êaivite Hindu monas-ticism, and a UCPP[jUKP is one 
who has renounced the world 
in search of God Realization and has been formally initiated by a IWTW who 
is himself a UCPP[jUKP . In Sansk¨it the 
word ©UCPP[jUCª literally means Òto 
throw downÓ or Òto abandon.Ó Thus, UCP
P[jUC is the giving up or abandonment 
of the world, and the UCPP[jUKP is one 
who has so renounced. True UCPP[jUC is 
not a denial of life but lifeÕs highest ful-Þllment. It is unmitigated selßessness. It is the relinquishment of the transient and illusory in favor of a permanent Reality, the eschewing of a worldly life that one may, by gradual stages of pur-ification, draw inward toward God as Para§iva, Truth Absolute. It is a break with the mundane and a binding unto the Divine. It is the repudiation of the FJCTOC , including the obligations and 
duties, of the householder and the ac-ceptance of the even more demanding FJCTOC  of the renunciate. The seasoned 
UCPP[jUKP is truly the liberated man, 
the spiritual exemplar, the disciplined [QIu and ultimately the knower of Truth, 
freed to commune with the Divine and bound to uplift humanity through the sharing of his wisdom, his peace, his devotion and his illumination, howev-er great or small. The UCPP[jUKP is the 
guardian of his religion, immersed in it, constantly freed from worldliness, freed 
from distraction, able to offer his work and his worship in unbroken continu-ity and one-pointed effectiveness. He undertakes certain disciplines includ-ing the puriÞcation of body, mind and emotions. He restrains and controls the mind through his UjFJCPC , VCRCU and 
meditative regimen. He unfolds from within himself a profound love of God and the Gods. His practice of WRjUCPj  
or worship is predominantly internal, seeking God êiva within. ¦In the êai-va tradition there have always existed among men a few, rare in numbers but mighty in their dedication to Lord êiva, for whom the world held no attraction and MCTOCU were on the wane. Such 
men are by nature inclined toward knowledge of God and disinclined to-ward desires of family, wealth and property, also spoken of by our spiritual forefathers as women, gold and land. Some among them are UjFJWU , anchor-
ites living in the seclusion of distant caves and remote forests or wandering as homeless mendicants, itinerant pil-grims to the holy sanctuaries of êaivism. Others dwell as cenobites assembled with their brothers, often in the jTCOC
CCFJGGPCO or OCJC of their UCVIWTW
but always under the IWTW¬U  aegis, serv-
ing together in fulÞllment of a common mission. These devotees, when initiated into the order of UCPP[jUC , don the saf-THE FOLLOWING IS A RELIGIOUS COVENANT BETWEEN A SANNY SINÑONE W HO

fron robes and thereby bind themselves 
to a universal body of Hindu renunci-ates whose existence has never ceased, an assembly of men inwardly linked in êivasambandham, their mutual dedica-tion to êiva, though not necessarily out-wardly associated. It is this venerable convocation which the UCPP[jUKP joins 
and to which he is bound for life in brotherhood and in service. ¦Tradition-ally, there are several levels of initiation for the êaivite monastic. Requirements and qualiÞcations vary according to the circumstances, the preceptor and the disciple. These initiations may be given early in the monasticÕs life or may await the completion of years or even decades of UjFJCPC  and puriÞcation before they 
are bestowed. It is not a matter of tem-poral experience or timing. The Þrst for-mal initiation for the aspirant is known as DTCJOCEJCT[CFuMUJj and enters the 
devotee into a chaste life of study, wor-ship and service. The next initiation is that of UCPP[jUCFuMUJj . This FuMUJj  is a 
formal Hindu rite, or less often an infor-mal blessing, entering the devotee into renunciate monasticism, binding him for life to certain vows which include chastity, poverty and obedience, and directing him on the path to God Real-ization. It must be realized that the cer-emonies described in the Rites of Initia-tion section herein form the customary rites of passage into UCPP[jUC but that 
it is not merely the observance of these ordinances which makes one a UCPP[j
UKP. Indeed, if not a single formality was 
followed, not a single vow solemnized, a true UCVIWTW may confer UCPP[jUC on 
a true disciple in a most informal man-ner. There are other forms of FuMUJj , not 
relating to monasticism, by which a spiritual teacher bestows blessings and 
awakening upon the devotee through the simple agency of a touch, word, look or thought. One such initiation is known as OCPVTCFuMUJj , which in the êaiva tradi-
tion is the teaching of the Pachkshara Mantra, ÒNamaú êivya.Ó ¦According to the venerable laws of Manu, one enters into UCPP[jUC after training with the 
IWTW but only if the candidate received 
DTCJOCEJCT[CFuMUJj  and commenced 
such training prior to his twenty-fifth birthday. Otherwise, all are expected to enter the life of the householder, em-bracing the life of renunciation, if they elect, after having concluded family and societal obligations around age seventy-two. Thus, there are two distinct types of UCPP[jUC . The Þrst is initiation of un-
married youth into the ancient world Order of UCPP[jUC . A second UCPP[jUC , 
described in the 8GFCU though not com-
monly observed in contemporary Hindu society, may be deÞned as the last of the four jTCOCU or stages of life. After ob-

A BRIEF HISTORY OF êAIVITE  
AND V AISHIAVITE MONASTICISM. 
2enunciation and asceticism have been an integral com-ponent of êaivite culture and religion from the earli-
est days, the most highly honored facet of the Hindu Dharma. Until around the ninth century, renunciation as a way of life was a uniquely êaivite phenom-enon, and even today the word UCP
P[jUKP  denotes particularly a êaivite 
ascetic, though etymologically it may be applied to all Hindu monks. Histori-cally, UCPP[jUC has not been a part of 
V aishºavism until fairly recently. There are certain distinctions to be observed between êaivite and V aishºavite UCP
P[jUKPU . Firstly, êaiva UCPP[jUKPU gen-
erally share a common philosophical ground, often described as monistic V e-dnta or êddha êaiva Siddhnta, while their V aishºavite counterparts embrace at least four distinct philosophies. Sec-ondly, êaiva UCPP[jUKPU throughout the 
Hindu world worship the same Deity, and wear the VKNCMC or sect mark on 
their foreheads, consisting of holy ash in three horizontal lines called VTKRWTC , 
with little variation. V aishºavite UCP
P[jUKP s, on the other hand, never make 
their VKNCMC with holy ash, but use vari-
ous forms, often consisting of sandal paste in three vertical lines, called WTFJXCRWTC . Worshiping VishºuÕs di-
vine incarnations, V aishºavite renunci-ates are often termed XCKTCIKU and may 
further distinguish themselves from the êaiva UCPP[jUKPU by using a rosary of 
VWNUC instead of the êaiviteÕs TWFTjMUJC
and by wearing white robes instead of the traditional saffron or ochre robes. This has brought about the terms .CN

order and yet freed from worldly obli-gation that he might Þnd and shed his spiritual light, started for êaivites be-fore the Mohejodaro and Harappa civi-lizations of Þve thousand years ago and traces its development in the references in the ºKI8GFC  around 1,000 B.C., to the

Renunciation of the world found a high expression in the monastic principles of Jainism and Buddhism, both religions founded by illustrious sons of India. Siddhrtha Gautama, the Buddha, was born and died a Hindu in the seventh century BC. He himself cherished, lived and promulgated the êaivite ascetic ideal within the compass of Hinduism, and his followers made a separate reli-gion of his teachings after his death. It is only in Hinduism, and more particu-larly in êaivism and the Hindu-inspired religions of Jainism and Buddhism, that asceticism is a vibrant and valued mode of life, a part of the natural FJCTOC
Though the homeless UjFJW and the 
wandering mendicant existed before, it was Gautama Buddha who around six hundred years BC, organized what had been an individual UjFJCPC into a mon-
astic order, which he termed the UCÌIC
Around the 8th or 9th century, di êa÷-karchrya, the great exemplar of the ideals of UCPP[jUC who revitalized and 
restored the ancient ways during his short life of thirty-two years, organized 
the Hindu monastics of his day. In his travels throughout India, he assessed the existing traditions and Þnally vali-dated ten orders of ascetics, at the same time establishing four religious centers or OCJCU in the North, East, South and 
West of India, known respectively as Jy-otiú, Govardhana, ê¨ingeri and êrada. Thus, the ancient Order of UCPP[jUC ex-
tends back to time immemorial, struc-turally inßuenced by Gautama Buddha about twenty-five centuries ago and revitalized in its present form by di êa÷karchrya around eleven hundred years ago.

jTCOC after age seventy-two through 
the customary initiatory rites given by a UCVIWTW and then diligently pursues 
his spiritual UjFJCPC in a state of genu-
ine renunciation and not in the midst of his family. Our Gurudeva spoke of this in June of 1968: ÒThe path of the family is a path of magnetic attachments. It is their duty to own property, to succeed in business and to raise their family until age seventy-two. This natural and nec-essary attachment to the world, coupled with the male and female principle in the family, prevents PKTXKMCNRCUCOjFJK  
in this way. He represents the active, aggressive, masculine energies of the RKÌICNj current, while she naturally ex-
presses the passive, feminine energies of the Kj current. The husband and wife 
are together a one being, but individual-ly they are psychically incomplete and dependent one upon the other. Through their harmonious and disciplined life they attain to the profound illumina-tions of UCXKMCNRCUCOjFJK  Now , the 
UCPP[jUKP balances within himself both 
the male and female energies. Complete unto himself, he is whole and indepen-dent. There arises within him a pure en-ergy, neither positive nor negative. This is the UWUJWOPC current coming into 
power through which he gains control of the MWCNKPK force and eventually, 
after years of careful guidance, attains PKTXKMCNRCUCOjFJK ¦Eventually, in 
one life or another, all will turn to the renunciate path. However, it would be equally improper for a renunciate-
minded soul to enter family life as for a IKJCUVJC to seek to be a UCPP[jUKP . 
Only the UCPP[jUKP can truly repudiate 
the world of illusion and proclaim the Truth which others may seek but which will always elude them. The -WNjTCXC
6CPVTC  states: Ò Austerities, restraints, the 
observance of vows, pilgrimages to holy places, bodily disciplines and other acts are ineffectual if performed by one who is uninitiated. One should, therefore, by all means be initiated by a IWTWª Again, 
the 4WFTC;COCNC proclaims: ÒHe who 
has not been initiated cannot acquire Divine Knowledge. Those who perform LCRC and RLj without being initiated 
derive no beneÞt, even as seeds sown on stone do not germinate.Ó The -CKXCN[C
7RCPKUJCF  proclaims, ÒNot by work, 
not by birth, nor by wealth, but by re-nunciation alone do the rare ones attain immortality.Ó (V erse 3). We Þnd the vir-tues of the UCPP[jUKP¬U  abdication of the 
world boldly expressed by Swm Vive-
knanda of the Puri Order, ÒNever for-get and teach to your children that as is the difference between a Þreßy and the blazing sun, between the inÞnite ocean and a little pond, between a mustard seed and the mountain Meru, such is the difference between the householder and the UCPP[jUKPª  A disciple asked Swm 
Viveknanda if it were true that without UCPP[jUC there could be no knowledge 
of Brahman. Swm replied, ÒThat is true. A thousand times true.Ò This lofty view of renunciation is echoed by His Holiness di êa÷karchrya, in his in-troduction to the #KVCTG[C7RCPKUJCF : 
ÒThe life of the householder is controlled by desire. Non-action or renunciation means the cessation of all relations

Of Sannysa with family, wealth and other objects 
of desire. Therefore, it is not possible for a knower of the Self to renounce action and at the same time lead a household-erÕs life.Ó The /WCMC7RCPKUJCF  says: 
ÒThe Self is not gained by the weak, nor by the insincere, nor by those who merely practice austerities, nor by those devoid of the necessary insignia; but wise men who strive with vigor, atten-tion and propriety attain union with BrahmanÓ (III.ii.4). êa÷karchrya in explaining this passage comments that by practicing UjFJCPC  without the ex-
ternal signs of the UCPP[jUKP , the saffron 
robes, FCC , and MCOCCNW , Brahman, 
which is difÞcult to attain, is not real-ized. In 6KTWOCPVKTCO , Saint Tirumular 
describes the insignia of the êiva [QIuP : 
T o smear holy ashes is the Þrst step to VCRCU  
Rings of copper in the ears,  And garland of TWFTjMUJC around the neckÑ 
These, too, are other emblems  For êiva to reach.  Thus does the blemishless êiva [QIuP

-COCCNW for water to hold.

These ten are the [QIu¬U appurtenances. 
Tirumantiram, Verse 1662 and 1664
¦Thus, our emphasis on the necessity 
for initiation into UCPP[jUC in both the 
perpetuation of êaivism and the attain-ment of ÀKXCLwjPC finds its authority 
in scripture, in the declaration of our beloved Gurudeva and in the halls of wisdom within. Let none append to this lesser postulations. Rather let all rise to the summit of understanding from which the imperious saints and sages 
of êaivism spoke forth these canons. We refute and oppose contemporary no-tions of UCPP[jUC which assert that it is 
for the masses, and which claim that it requires neither qualiÞcation nor disci-pline, neither celibacy nor commitment. Such approaches are neither scriptural nor wise, but relegate this most noble way of life to ordinariness and make popular and common that which has al-ways been exceptional and rare. We re-fute as well the conception of UCPP[jUC
as an existential surpassing of religion or an ecumenical embracing of all re-ligions as sometimes practiced by non-Hindus. It is not a [QIC path set apart 
from the Santana Dharma, equally available to Christians, Jews and even those not afÞliated with any faith. It is a strictly Hindu path, and all true UCPP[j
UKPU are Hindus, for UCPP[jUCKU  Hindu 
monasticism. Just as a rabbi is revered among the Jews and a cardinal among the Catholics, so are UCPP[jUKPU the 
most dedicated of Hindus, the teachers of their tradition and the guardians of their great scripture. For a Christian or a Jew to wear the saffron vestments and call himself UYjOu is a wrongful abuse 
of both sacred traditions and must nev-er be condoned. That is not to say that non-Hindus cannot become renunciates in the truest sense, only that they must do so within the context of their own religion. It must be added that realiza-tion is not restricted to Hindu renunci-ates, but to devout followers of any re-ligion which has non-dual union with the Absolute or 0KTXCMCNRC5COjFJK  as 
its final goal, provided such aspirants renounce the world and come under the graceful guidance of an awakened

ine renunciation and not in the midst of his family. Our Gurudeva spoke of this in June of 1968: ÒThe path of the family is a path of magnetic attachments. It is their duty to own property, to succeed in business and to raise their family until age seventy-two. This natural and nec-essary attachment to the world, coupled with the male and female principle in the family, prevents PKTXKMCNRCUCOjFJK  
in this way. He represents the active, aggressive, masculine energies of the RKÌICNj current, while she naturally ex-
presses the passive, feminine energies of the Kj current. The husband and wife 
are together a one being, but individual-ly they are psychically incomplete and dependent one upon the other. Through their harmonious and disciplined life they attain to the profound illumina-tions of UCXKMCNRCUCOjFJK  Now , the 
UCPP[jUKP balances within himself both 
the male and female energies. Complete unto himself, he is whole and indepen-dent. There arises within him a pure en-ergy, neither positive nor negative. This is the UWUJWOPC current coming into 
power through which he gains control of the MWCNKPK force and eventually, 
after years of careful guidance, attains PKTXKMCNRCUCOjFJK ¦Eventually, in 
one life or another, all will turn to the renunciate path. However, it would be equally improper for a renunciate-
minded soul to enter family life as for a IKJCUVJC to seek to be a UCPP[jUKP . 
Only the UCPP[jUKP can truly repudiate 
the world of illusion and proclaim the Truth which others may seek but which will always elude them. The -WNjTCXC
6CPVTC  states: Ò Austerities, restraints, the 
observance of vows, pilgrimages to holy places, bodily disciplines and other acts are ineffectual if performed by one who is uninitiated. One should, therefore, by all means be initiated by a IWTWª Again, 
the 4WFTC;COCNC proclaims: ÒHe who 
has not been initiated cannot acquire Divine Knowledge. Those who perform LCRC and RLj without being initiated 
derive no beneÞt, even as seeds sown on stone do not germinate.Ó The -CKXCN[C
7RCPKUJCF  proclaims, ÒNot by work, 
not by birth, nor by wealth, but by re-nunciation alone do the rare ones attain immortality.Ó (V erse 3). We Þnd the vir-tues of the UCPP[jUKP¬U  abdication of the 
world boldly expressed by Swm Vive-
knanda of the Puri Order, ÒNever for-get and teach to your children that as is the difference between a Þreßy and the blazing sun, between the inÞnite ocean and a little pond, between a mustard seed and the mountain Meru, such is the difference between the householder and the UCPP[jUKPª  A disciple asked Swm 
Viveknanda if it were true that without UCPP[jUC there could be no knowledge 
of Brahman. Swm replied, ÒThat is true. A thousand times true.Ò This lofty view of renunciation is echoed by His Holiness di êa÷karchrya, in his in-troduction to the #KVCTG[C7RCPKUJCF : 
ÒThe life of the householder is controlled by desire. Non-action or renunciation means the cessation of all relations 
Page 272

Holy Orders
Of Sannysa with family, wealth and other objects 
of desire. Therefore, it is not possible for a knower of the Self to renounce action and at the same time lead a household-erÕs life.Ó The /WCMC7RCPKUJCF  says: 
ÒThe Self is not gained by the weak, nor by the insincere, nor by those who merely practice austerities, nor by those devoid of the necessary insignia; but wise men who strive with vigor, atten-tion and propriety attain union with BrahmanÓ (III.ii.4). êa÷karchrya in explaining this passage comments that by practicing UjFJCPC  without the ex-
ternal signs of the UCPP[jUKP , the saffron 
robes, FCC , and MCOCCNW , Brahman, 
which is difÞcult to attain, is not real-ized. In 6KTWOCPVKTCO , Saint Tirumular 
describes the insignia of the êiva [QIuP : 
T o smear holy ashes is the Þrst step to VCRCU  
Rings of copper in the ears,  And garland of TWFTjMUJC around the neckÑ 
These, too, are other emblems  For êiva to reach.  Thus does the blemishless êiva [QIuP
For VCRCU prepare. -WCNC for ears to adorn. 
-COCCNW for water to hold.  
-CKMC for neck to Þll,  
A conch to blow, a bowl to beg,  And a MCRRCTC to hold the ashes,  
The correct sandals and [QIuE seat,  
The [QIC sash and [QIC staffÑ 
These ten are the [QIu¬U appurtenances. 
Tirumantiram, Verse 1662 and 1664
¦Thus, our emphasis on the necessity 
for initiation into UCPP[jUC in both the 
perpetuation of êaivism and the attain-ment of ÀKXCLwjPC finds its authority 
in scripture, in the declaration of our beloved Gurudeva and in the halls of wisdom within. Let none append to this lesser postulations. Rather let all rise to the summit of understanding from which the imperious saints and sages 
of êaivism spoke forth these canons. We refute and oppose contemporary no-tions of UCPP[jUC which assert that it is 
for the masses, and which claim that it requires neither qualiÞcation nor disci-pline, neither celibacy nor commitment. Such approaches are neither scriptural nor wise, but relegate this most noble way of life to ordinariness and make popular and common that which has al-ways been exceptional and rare. We re-fute as well the conception of UCPP[jUC
as an existential surpassing of religion or an ecumenical embracing of all re-ligions as sometimes practiced by non-Hindus. It is not a [QIC path set apart 
from the Santana Dharma, equally available to Christians, Jews and even those not afÞliated with any faith. It is a strictly Hindu path, and all true UCPP[j
UKPU are Hindus, for UCPP[jUCKU  Hindu 
monasticism. Just as a rabbi is revered among the Jews and a cardinal among the Catholics, so are UCPP[jUKPU the 
most dedicated of Hindus, the teachers of their tradition and the guardians of their great scripture. For a Christian or a Jew to wear the saffron vestments and call himself UYjOu is a wrongful abuse 
of both sacred traditions and must nev-er be condoned. That is not to say that non-Hindus cannot become renunciates in the truest sense, only that they must do so within the context of their own religion. It must be added that realiza-tion is not restricted to Hindu renunci-ates, but to devout followers of any re-ligion which has non-dual union with the Absolute or 0KTXCMCNRC5COjFJK  as 
its final goal, provided such aspirants renounce the world and come under the graceful guidance of an awakened

And helps others to cross it. 
Bhakti StrasÑ Verses 46Ð50 
O Fool! Leave off the desire  
For accumulated wealth.  Create in the mind thoughts  About Reality, devoid of passion.  The water on the lotus leaf  Is very unsteady.  So also is life extremely unstable.  Know that the entire world is devoured  By disease and conceit,  And smitten with sorrow.  Do not be proud of wealth,  Kindred and youth.  Time takes away all these in a moment.

'iven by the UCVIWTW or after 
his OCJjUCOjFJK by his 
designated UYjOuU the cer-
emony for UCPP[jUCFuMUJj
is called the XKTCIC sacrifice. These 
sacred rites are often solemnized dur-ing ÀKXCTjVTK it being considered auspi-
cious for UCPP[jUKPU to commence their 
monastic life on êivaÕs most sanctiÞed night, or alternatively during the full moon in May, a time that honors our beloved GurudevaÕs FuMUJj It includes 
specific instruction in meditation and other spiritual practices and OCPVTCU
all of which is never disclosed. The ÀKXC
2WTjCU enjoin the candidate to fast on 
fruits and milk for twelve days before the ceremony and to chant the Savit¨i OCPVTC©1ODJTDJWXCÏUXCÏ6CV5CXKVWTXCTG[C$JCTIQFGXCU[CFJuOCJK&JK[Q[QPCÏRTCEJQFC[jVªºKI8GFC¨3.62.10. Prior to the initiation rites, the candidate symbolically performs the 
obsequies for his parents including the customary food offerings, thus releasing himself from that obligation at a future date. ¦Early in the morning on the cho-sen auspicious day, the candidate pros-trates before the UCVIWTW , divested of all 
possessions, having given up all things personal. A Gaºe§a RLj is performed 
and the sacred JQOC fire is kindled 
in preparation for the XKTCLC sacrifice. 
With the candidate optionally knee-deep in water, a blessing is given by the UCVIWTW by which all residual worldly 
impurities are removed, and the candi-dateÕs head is then shaved. T ogether he and the UCVIWTW symbolically conduct 
his CPV[GUKUCUMjTC the ritual funeral 
rites, to betoken the death of the person-al self and the birth of the spiritual be-ing. He places the remnants of personal identity, hair, clothing, RWNPWN  or sacred 
thread and all desires for wealth, prog-eny and fame into the JQOC fire, be-
seeching the permission of Lord Gaºe§a and heeding the path of Lord Muruga, vowing aloud his renunciation thus: Ò All that I have and all that I am I now give unto my God, my Gods and my IWTW I 
have no family except the Divine Father êiva and Mother êakti who dwell in Kai-ls and on earth the UCÌICO of êaivite 
devotees. I have no home except the stillness of Being. I have no possessions except my faith and dedication. I have no desires except my desire to serve and to realize God.Ò The candidate then says aloud three times, ÒI, wishing for OWMVK

of my life is to cultivate dispassion, to become pure, to attain union with God

to kneel at the IWTW¬U feet. He is thereaf-

whispers the Pachkshara Mantra in 
the UCPP[jUKP¬U right ear three times, 
along with personal instructions for meditation. The UCPP[jUKP is given his 
ascetic name, his FCC a OjNj of 108 
TWFTjMUJC beads for LCRC[QIC a deer

bathing in the nearby river where he in-tones the OCPVTC dips three times into 
the waters and then dons the MCXK for the

is performed to invoke the blessings of the Second and Third Worlds. The UCV

then prostrates three times before the UCVIWTW and the ceremony is conclud-

great and ageless Order. He then walks in the direction of the Himlayas, home of Lord êiva, to be invited back by his brothers to join in the monastic commu-nity to serve, or to be sent on pilgrimage to return at a speciÞed later date. On the 
night of his FuMUJj he is required to beg 
his meal. The above constitutes the for-mal rites of initiation, and though the ceremony be an informal declaration by the preceptor or the simple giving of the saffron robes and a name, the valid-

Of Sannysa Learn from me now, Oh son of Kunti,  
How man made perfect is one with Brahman,  The goal of wisdom.  When the mind and the heart  Are freed from delusion, united with Brahman,  When steady will has subdued the senses,  When sight, taste and sound are abandoned,  Without regretting, without aversion;  When man seeks solitude, eats but little,  Curbing his speech, his mind and body,  Ever engaged in meditation on Brahman,  The Truth, and full of compassion;  When he casts from him vanity, violence,  Pride, lust, anger and all his possessions,  T otally free from the sense of ego  And tranquil of heart:  That man is ready for oneness with Brahman.  And he who dwells united with Brahman,  Calm in mind, not grieving, not craving,  Regarding all men with equal acceptance: He loves me most dearly.

love, such as a fruit or ßower, and pros-trate himself at the feet of his UCVIWTW , 
or in his absence before the Holy San-dals or in the direction where the IWTW
abides. 
2. 
The disciple shall in devotion or knowl-
edge look upon the person of the UCVIW
TWas the very embodiment of Lord êiva, 
offering every service and reverence equally unto both, making no distinc-tion between the two. 
3. 
The disciple shall in faith and trust obey 
his UCVIWTW , setting aside his own needs 
and preferences that he may carry out the directions and wishes, expressed or implied, of the IWTW without delay or 
reservation. 
4. 
The disciple shall in his every act and 
thought seek the blessings, inwardly or in person, of the UCVIWTW , always acting 
in harmony with the preceptorÕs will,  
surrendering himself unconditionally, trusting in his MasterÕs supreme wis-dom and seeking refuge in his grace. 
5. 
The disciple shall observe the accep-
tance of WEnJKUJC  and the sanctified 
waters from the CDJKUJGMCO of the VKTW
XCFK, and in all service to the spiritual 
master realize that the whole of exis-tence, sentient and insentient, is served. 
6.

ner form of the UCVIWTW , earnestly striv-
ing through this IWTWFJ[jPC  to under-
stand his temperament, the contents of his heart and his essential nature as eternal, peaceful, unattachedÑas IWTWVCVVXC , the essence that pervades form. 
7. 
The disciple shall never criticize nor ad-
vise the IWTW nor contradict him, nor 
correct, nor argue with him; nor shall he allow others to do so in his presence, never listening to criticism directed to-ward his preceptor, defending him in such instances and leaving the presence of those who persist in such denigration. He shall accept correction and criticism openly, and look upon the wrath of the Master as a Þery grace capable of con-suming unseemly MCTOC and upon his 
praise as a merciful grace. 
8. 
The disciple shall not stand or sit above 
the UCVIWTW , or take a place of author-
ity or instruct others in his presence, or carry on worldly activity or conversa-tion before him, or walk or drive ahead of him, or partake of anything without Þrst offering it to the preceptor. 
9. 
The disciple shall never utter falsehood 
before the UCVIWTW , nor words of con-
tempt; neither shall he approach or ad-dress him as an equal, stretch his legs in the IWTW¬U direction or touch his body or 
possessions with the feet; neither shall he imitate him in dress or deportment, nor speak excessively or with pride in his holy presence. 
10. 
The disciple shall emulate the awakened 
qualities he sees in the spiritual teacher as he strives for realization of the Truth which is the gracious gift of the UCVIWTW
and attainable by no other means.

and by action do what is helpful to the IWTW As in the vicinity of fire butter 
gets melted, so in the proximity of the holy IWTW all sins dissolve. As darkness 
is destroyed at the very sight of the lamp, so is ignorance destroyed at the very sight of the holy IWTW/QMUJC is 
in the palm of his hand.Ó The true UCP
P[jUKP will know that knowledge of the 
Self arises only from the UCVIWTW , know 
further that there is but one UCVIWTW in 
this life and that the three worlds grieve to see a disciple abuse or abandon his teacher and rejoice in the faithful and constant disciple. The ceremony of UCP
P[jUCFuMUJj  binds IWTW and disciple 
psychically, much in the manner of the lifetime bonds established between man and wife when vows of matrimony are solemnized; both are very real inner ties, not to be broken without unhappy consequences. )WTW)uVj  states, ÒThey 
who understand the signiÞcance of the great teachings by service to the IWTW
are real UCPP[jUKP s. All others are mere 
wearers of the ochre-colored robes.Ó ¦There follow T en Observances of the Guru-Disciple Relationship compiled from the )WTW)uVj and given unto the 
UCPP[jUKPU of this Order to observe as 
best they can:

Holy Orders
Of Sannysa 1. 
The disciple shall d aily offer a gift in 
love, such as a fruit or ßower, and pros-trate himself at the feet of his UCVIWTW , 
or in his absence before the Holy San-dals or in the direction where the IWTW
abides. 
2. 
The disciple shall in devotion or knowl-
edge look upon the person of the UCVIW
TWas the very embodiment of Lord êiva, 
offering every service and reverence equally unto both, making no distinc-tion between the two. 
3. 
The disciple shall in faith and trust obey 
his UCVIWTW , setting aside his own needs 
and preferences that he may carry out the directions and wishes, expressed or implied, of the IWTW without delay or 
reservation. 
4. 
The disciple shall in his every act and 
thought seek the blessings, inwardly or in person, of the UCVIWTW , always acting 
in harmony with the preceptorÕs will,  
surrendering himself unconditionally, trusting in his MasterÕs supreme wis-dom and seeking refuge in his grace. 
5. 
The disciple shall observe the accep-
tance of WEnJKUJC  and the sanctified 
waters from the CDJKUJGMCO of the VKTW
XCFK, and in all service to the spiritual 
master realize that the whole of exis-tence, sentient and insentient, is served. 
6. 
The disciple shall meditate upon the in-
ner form of the UCVIWTW , earnestly striv-
ing through this IWTWFJ[jPC  to under-
stand his temperament, the contents of his heart and his essential nature as eternal, peaceful, unattachedÑas IWTWVCVVXC , the essence that pervades form. 
7. 
The disciple shall never criticize nor ad-
vise the IWTW nor contradict him, nor 
correct, nor argue with him; nor shall he allow others to do so in his presence, never listening to criticism directed to-ward his preceptor, defending him in such instances and leaving the presence of those who persist in such denigration. He shall accept correction and criticism openly, and look upon the wrath of the Master as a Þery grace capable of con-suming unseemly MCTOC and upon his 
praise as a merciful grace. 
8. 
The disciple shall not stand or sit above 
the UCVIWTW , or take a place of author-
ity or instruct others in his presence, or carry on worldly activity or conversa-tion before him, or walk or drive ahead of him, or partake of anything without Þrst offering it to the preceptor. 
9. 
The disciple shall never utter falsehood 
before the UCVIWTW , nor words of con-
tempt; neither shall he approach or ad-dress him as an equal, stretch his legs in the IWTW¬U direction or touch his body or 
possessions with the feet; neither shall he imitate him in dress or deportment, nor speak excessively or with pride in his holy presence. 
10. 
The disciple shall emulate the awakened 
qualities he sees in the spiritual teacher as he strives for realization of the Truth which is the gracious gift of the UCVIWTW
and attainable by no other means.

Of Sannysa THE SANNY SINÕS FIVE SACRED VOWS OF RENUNCIATION, PURITY , OBEDI ENCE, 
HUMILITY AND CONFIDENCE ARE BOTH AN IDEAL AND A CODE OF MONASTI CISM 
THROUGH WHICH THAT IDEAL MAY BE REALIZED. AS AN IDEAL, THEY EXP RESS 
THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVES OF MONASTIC LIFE, THE STATES OF BEIN G AND 
CONSCIOUSNESS TOW ARD WHICH THE êAIV A SANNY SIN IS STRIVING AND WHICH 
CONSTITUTE THE UNOBSTRUCTED EXPRESSION OF HIS SOUL. AS A CODE OF LIV-
ING, THEY PROVIDE THE DISCIPLINES, PRACTICES, STANDARDS AND RUL ES WHICH, 
WHEN RELIGIOUSLY OBSERVED, UNIFY THE BROTHERHOOD OF RENUNCIATES  INTO 
A SINGLE SPIRITUAL BODY AND GUIDE ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS TOW ARD  THE 
COMMON GOALS OF SERVICE, DEV OTION, SPIRITUALITY AND GOD REALIZA TION. 
4he five sacred vows hereunder 
constitute a holy covenant by which the UCPP[jUKP pledges 
himself to the ideals they con-
tain and solemnly swears to defend and preserve the doctrines and faith of êaivism and the traditions of UCP
P[jUC itself. The UCPP[jUKP enters into 
this covenant entirely of his own voli-tion and takes these vows between him-self and the divine Beings of all Three Worlds, binding and obligating himself in the fulÞllment thereof to his UCVIWTW , 
his fellow UCPP[jUKP s, and indeed to 
all êaivites. ¦These are lifetime vows, once taken they can never be rescinded or relinquished. The UCPP[jUKP pledges 
to faithfully abide by these vows for the remainder of his life, in good times and in bad, a pledge which transcends any changes in his Order and endures be-yond the life of any and all of its mem-bers, including the UCVIWTW . He knows 
that difficulties may come to him and to his fellow renunciates at one time or another and that these tests may be all the more challenging for those who have progressed the farthest, just as the mountain climber faces his greatest ob-stacles near the summit. He will not lose heart if impediments appear, but face even the most difÞcult passages through his MCTOC with courage, determination 
and affectionate detachment. Most of what he will experience from this day onwards will not be the residue of a per-sonal past but the MCTOC of the larger 
body of êaivites which he has willingly undertaken to resolve, the MCTOC of his 
religion and its myriad members. He may take heart when in the midst of difficulties, knowing they are but the MCTOC of others inherited by virtue of 
his selßess service. ¦These Sacred V ows are administered by the UCVIWTW , or af-
ter his OCJjUCOjFJK by his designated 
initiating UYjOuU These solemn vows 
enter the UCPP[jUKP onto the illustrious 
path of the Hindu renunciate, relieving him from a worldly FJCTOC  that he may 
diligently strive to know God êiva in His three perfections: Para§iva, Mahe§vara and Satchidnanda. Saint Tirumular spoke eloquently of the need for renun-ciation: 
They know not the evil fruits MCTOC brings.  
They choose not to Þnd LwjPC  
For liberation from MCTOC  
ÒRenounce MCTOC and be liberatedÓÑ 
This V edic teaching they know not.  They who wallow in MCTOC  
Will never the Rich Harvest reap. 
Renouncing all, I inwardly entered  
And beheld the Light within.  My heart trembled. I prostrated low.  But Him I never forgot;  And the Lord of Celestials  Freeing me from the whirl of births  Immortal made me, here.
Sunder your desires. Sunder your desires.  
Sunder your desires even unto the Lord.  The more the desires, the more the sorrows.  The more you give up,  The more your bliss shall be.
A million times they are born and die; 
In a million follies they forget this.  In the darkness of OCNC they are enveloped, 
When, at last, the hidden grace of êiva Bursts forth and chases away the night.  Then comes the moment for the soul to renounce,  And it then becomes a radiant Light.

THE SACRED VOW OF RENUNCIATION: 
KNOWN IN TAMIL AS AHATTURAVU.
2enunciation is the relinquish-ment of world, desire and ego. It is detachment founded in knowledge of the magnet-
ic nature of body, mind and emotion, a knowledge which inclines the soul to-ward non-involvement with external forms and, in time, summons forth real-ization of Para§iva, Absolute Reality. Re-nunciation is repudiation of individual personality and ownership. It is poverty as opposed to affluence, simplicity as opposed to ramiÞcation in life. It is self-containment, freedom from worldliness and its concomitant distractions and obligations. In its deeper sense, renunci-ation is a surrendering of limited identi-ty, ego-sense or individuality known in Sansk¨it as CJCMjTC that the soul may 
soar to the very depths of Being. It is the beginning of the end of UCUjTC , the 
wheel of rebirths, the death of the old ushering in a spiritual renascence which will ultimately mature into illu-mination and OQMUJC . It is the ultimate ripeness of the soul and mystic mar-
riage to God êiva. It is the Mahvrata, or Great Oath, of the êaivite pathÞnders and contains within it commitment to the unwritten and even unspoken cus-toms followed by those who have worn the MCXK for untold centuries. In Tamil, 
renunciation for the UCPP[jUKP is known 
as CJCVVWTCXW , which means Òdetach-
ment through giving up the sense of ÕIÕ and Õmine,Õ Ó epitomizing the ideal of this Sacred V ow. ¦Renunciation is not a running away from the world provoked by fear or failure therein. Rather it is an irrepressible drawing into sacred realms of consciousness and being far more subtle and demanding of discipline than anything the world may offerÑa state of being that follows fulÞllment in the world as the next natural evolution of consciousness. Renunciation is not an opportunity to shun responsibility or to do as one pleases, but carries with it challenges and accountability of an even more formidable, albeit inner, na-ture. It is not a disgust for this world, but a love of deeper worlds so great that the material universe and its gifts are, by comparison, mean and meager. Though he strives to be affectionately detached, the UCPP[jUKP should never 
become indifferent or so accepting of all that happens that he accepts passive-ly harm to himself, his Order or his reli-gion. The renunciateÕs life is not one of inactivity, but vital activity directed to-ward selßess and spiritual endsÑan in-ner consciousness described in scrip-tures as the giving up not of work but the fruits thereof, whether apparently good or bad. It is not by virtuous acts that the UCPP[jUKP attains liberation.

FJCTOC  and the acceptance of the UCP
P[jUKPFJCTOC , a FJCTOC  which will 
create or resolve MCTOCU according to 
how it is discharged. Though it disal-lows personal possessions and upholds the ideals of simplicity known as pover-ty, renunciation is not a condition of destitution, deprivation or disregard for oneÕs well-being.

strive, especially at the outset, to quell the forces of pride, pretension and con-ceit, never allowing himself to feel the flush of self-importance or arrogance. He must guard his modesty as a trea-sure, never holding himself superior to others, for there is no conceit so tena-cious as the spiritual ego. Before he is well-grounded and stable in his realiza-tion, he must give up all UKFFJKU that may arise as a natural consequence of 
his UjFJCPC  and unfoldment, neither 
desiring nor encouraging such powers. He must see the perfection resident within the souls of all men, but remain aware of his own faults and transgres-sions, however insignificant. He must remain equally indifferent to both praise and blame, never allowing others to extol his virtues, never speaking per-sonally of himself or his past, even when asked. He must never accept per-sonal gifts, however small or well-in-tended. However, he may accept food and minimal travel assistance and re-ceive nonpersonal contributions on be-half of the monastery, placing them im-mediately upon the altar, offered to the Lord. ¦ The UCPP[jUKP cultivates renun-

He culti-vates renunciation through remaining secure within his inner consciousness and radiating the joy and contentment which are the harbingers of awakening. He cultivates renunciation through liv-ing simply, holding the consciousness that Lord êiva has entrusted to him the care of tools and personal items which he uses; such an attitude of custodian-ship averts any sense of possessiveness.

P[jUKP attains as much as that 
which he already is, and which becomes evident as the layers of adulterating ex-perience and beclouding conceptions are dissipated. Purity is clarity and clearness in all dimensions of beingÑphysical, mental and emotional. It is in-nocence as opposed to familiarity with the ways of the world. It is, for UCPP[j
UKPU the observance of chastity, called 
DTCJOCEJjT[C . In Tamil purity is given 
its fullest expression in the term VKTK
MCTCPPCUWVVK which means Òpurity in 
mind, speech and body.Ò These threeÑalso called thought, word and deedÑconvey the amplitude of the ideal of pu-rity. ¦Purity does not consist in merely doing good and being good, though these are essential, nor is it an external appearance or show of such goodness. It is primarily an inner quality, equally present in the saint who outwardly re-ßects the purity of his attainment and in the sage who inwardly rests in that same purity though his attainment may not be apparent. Purity is not a manner of behavior, though it may be reßected in our behavior, and there is no merit in taking on the semblance of being pure when one is not yet pure. ¦Purity for the UCPP[jUKP may be defined as wis-
dom in handling the forces of the mind and body, including the sexual instincts. In aspiring toward the ideals of purity, 
the êaiva UCPP[jUKP must attune him-
self to the inner worlds, the Second and Third Worlds. He must strive to live the contemplative life, cautiously avoiding undue or unseemly involvement with the world. He must associate with other Hindu devotees, seeking the company of good and holy men. He must be pure in his thoughts, never allowing his mind to indulge in sexual fantasies. He must speak pure words that reflect the pu-rity of his thought, never using harsh, angered or indecent language. ¦The UCPP[jUKP cultivates purity through 
harnessing the sexual energies which are a natural concomitant of human nature. He cultivates purity through maintaining a clean and healthy physi-cal body. He cultivates purity through observance of CJKUj , the great oath of

ConclusionTHE SACRED VOW OF HUMILITY: 
KNOWN IN TAMIL AS PANNIVU. 
(umility is the state of profound maturity in which the soul, im-mersed in the depths of under-standing and compassion, radi-
ates the qualities of mildness, modesty, reverent obeisance and unpretentious-ness. There is an analogy in the êaivite tradition that compares the unfolding soul to wheat. When young and grow-ing, the stalks of wheat stand tall and proud, but when mature their heads bend low under the weight of the grains they yield. Similarly, man is self-asser-tive, arrogant and vain only in the early stages of his spiritual growth. As he ma-tures and yields the harvest of divine knowledge, he too bends his head. In the Tamil language this absence of pride or self-assertion is known as RCPPKXW
2CPPKXW also means Òjewel.Ò In the *QN[
-WTCN  it is said that ÒHumility and pleas-
ant words are the jewels that adorn a man; there are none other.Ò ¦Humility does not consist in concealing our mer-its and virtues or in thinking ourselves as worse or more ordinary than we are. Nor is it a pretended meekness. Rather it lies in not exalting ourselves before oth-ers, for we perceive the grandeur of God êiva in every human being and rever-ently acknowledge Him there. Humility in this ideal is the awakened perception that Òêiva is All.Ó It is the inner being pre-dominating over the outer nature. ¦Hu-mility may be deÞned for the UCPP[jUKP
as wisdom in handling the ego. He must learn to accept criticism and correc-tion without justifying himself, without defending his actions, even when that correction is unjust or unfounded. He must not make claims of knowledge or attainment, even when he possesses 
knowledge and attainmentÑfor it is the highest knowledge that knows ÒWe know not.Ó Unless so ordained, he must not presume to guide or direct others in their unfoldment, but allow the FGXCU
and Mahdevas to direct this inner pro-cess. He must exercise restraint in his dealings with others, allowing them to have the fullest freedom in expressing themselves and never attempting to con-trol or direct them. He must execute all tasks and chores equally, not consider-ing one work as desirable and another as distasteful. He must avoid the pitfalls inherent in title and position, never al-lowing himself to identify with external importance and never feeling himself superior or inferior to others, for inferi-ority, too, is a shadow cast by the ego. He must become detached from the desire for status or position, never allowing jealousy to arise should other monas-tics be apparently promoted or given greater privileges or opportunities. He must endure hardships and problems in strength, never carping or complaining, for difÞculties are the very grist of the mills of the path of UjFJCPC  followed by 
his IWTWRCTCORCTj He must remain 
open to correction and suggestion, wel-coming it as a means of amending his 
faults and bettering his performance, never criticizing others for criticizing him. He must act always with decorum and nobility, never dominating conver-sations, never forcing his own opinions or preferences in discussions, never in-terrupting when others are speaking but listening intently that he may come to truly understand their views. ¦The UCPP[jUKP cultivates humility through 
learning to take the experiences of life

Of Sannysa in understanding and not in reaction, 
for the man of perfect understanding accepts all happenings in life as pur-poseful and good. He cultivates humil-ity through seeing God everywhere, knowing that He is at work in all sen-tient and insentient beings and there-fore loving and revering all as God êiva Himself. He cultivates humility through practicing patience with circumstances and forbearance with people. He culti-vates humility through controlling his speech and his actions. He cultivates humility through drawing near the in-nate refinement of the soul, which is ever gentle and quiet and centered, for pride, pretension and self-importance are but different names for externality. He cultivates humility through abdi-cating self-interest and self-indulgence, turning his awareness to compassionate and universal interests. He cultivates humility through being thankful for the rare privilege of having a UCVIWTW . 
He cultivates humility by learning to work closely with his artisan or those who are teaching and instructing him, bringing a flower or other small gift to offer before classes or meetings and treating his teachers, and indeed all who are his senior in physical years, with respect. He cultivates humility by assuring that his actions in dealing with others are meant always to uplift them, never to lower them that he might stand higher.

ConclusionTHE SACRED VOW OF HUMILITY: 
KNOWN IN TAMIL AS PANNIVU. 
(umility is the state of profound maturity in which the soul, im-mersed in the depths of under-standing and compassion, radi-
ates the qualities of mildness, modesty, reverent obeisance and unpretentious-ness. There is an analogy in the êaivite tradition that compares the unfolding soul to wheat. When young and grow-ing, the stalks of wheat stand tall and proud, but when mature their heads bend low under the weight of the grains they yield. Similarly, man is self-asser-tive, arrogant and vain only in the early stages of his spiritual growth. As he ma-tures and yields the harvest of divine knowledge, he too bends his head. In the Tamil language this absence of pride or self-assertion is known as RCPPKXW
2CPPKXW also means Òjewel.Ò In the *QN[
-WTCN  it is said that ÒHumility and pleas-
ant words are the jewels that adorn a man; there are none other.Ò ¦Humility does not consist in concealing our mer-its and virtues or in thinking ourselves as worse or more ordinary than we are. Nor is it a pretended meekness. Rather it lies in not exalting ourselves before oth-ers, for we perceive the grandeur of God êiva in every human being and rever-ently acknowledge Him there. Humility in this ideal is the awakened perception that Òêiva is All.Ó It is the inner being pre-dominating over the outer nature. ¦Hu-mility may be deÞned for the UCPP[jUKP
as wisdom in handling the ego. He must learn to accept criticism and correc-tion without justifying himself, without defending his actions, even when that correction is unjust or unfounded. He must not make claims of knowledge or attainment, even when he possesses 
knowledge and attainmentÑfor it is the highest knowledge that knows ÒWe know not.Ó Unless so ordained, he must not presume to guide or direct others in their unfoldment, but allow the FGXCU
and Mahdevas to direct this inner pro-cess. He must exercise restraint in his dealings with others, allowing them to have the fullest freedom in expressing themselves and never attempting to con-trol or direct them. He must execute all tasks and chores equally, not consider-ing one work as desirable and another as distasteful. He must avoid the pitfalls inherent in title and position, never al-lowing himself to identify with external importance and never feeling himself superior or inferior to others, for inferi-ority, too, is a shadow cast by the ego. He must become detached from the desire for status or position, never allowing jealousy to arise should other monas-tics be apparently promoted or given greater privileges or opportunities. He must endure hardships and problems in strength, never carping or complaining, for difÞculties are the very grist of the mills of the path of UjFJCPC  followed by 
his IWTWRCTCORCTj He must remain 
open to correction and suggestion, wel-coming it as a means of amending his 
faults and bettering his performance, never criticizing others for criticizing him. He must act always with decorum and nobility, never dominating conver-sations, never forcing his own opinions or preferences in discussions, never in-terrupting when others are speaking but listening intently that he may come to truly understand their views. ¦The UCPP[jUKP cultivates humility through

He cultivates humility through practicing patience with circumstances and forbearance with people. He culti-vates humility through controlling his speech and his actions. He cultivates humility through drawing near the in-nate refinement of the soul, which is ever gentle and quiet and centered, for pride, pretension and self-importance are but different names for externality. He cultivates humility through abdi-cating self-interest and self-indulgence, turning his awareness to compassionate and universal interests. He cultivates humility through being thankful for the rare privilege of having a UCVIWTW . 
He cultivates humility by learning to work closely with his artisan or those who are teaching and instructing him, bringing a flower or other small gift to offer before classes or meetings and treating his teachers, and indeed all who are his senior in physical years, with respect. He cultivates humility by assuring that his actions in dealing with others are meant always to uplift them, never to lower them that he might stand higher. He cultivates humility through putting into practice the ideals of the êivanadiyar, serving as the slave of the servants of the Lord, respecting and working harmoniously with elders of the êaivite community and with all genuine UYjOuUOWPKU and UjFJW s of

core the nondual ( advaitic ) identity of 
God, soul and world. This monistic-theistic philosophy, unlike the Ía˜kara, or Smârta view, holds that mâyâ  (the principle of

ÇØ¸Ê™ ⁄–ØÛŸ≥™ “Nondual

manifestation) is not an obstacle to God Realization, but God’s own power and pres-ence guiding the soul’s evolution to perfec-tion. This unified V edic-Ågamic doctrine is also known as Íuddha Íaiva Siddhânta.

there are many words in Sansk®it, such as: mahâprasthâna,  “great departure;” 
samâdhimara∫a,  dying consciously while 
in the state of meditation; mahâsamâdhi, 
“great merger, or ab sorption,” naming the 
departure of an enlightened soul. Hindus know death to be the soul’s detaching itself from the physical body and continuing on in the subtle body (sûkshma ßarîra) with 
the same desires, aspirations and occupa-tions as when it lived in a physical body. See: reincarnation, suicide.

conversion to Hinduism: Entering Hindu-
ism has traditionally required little more than accepting and living the beliefs and codes of Hindus. This remains the basic factor of adoption, although there are, and always have been, formal ceremonies rec-ognizing an individual’s entrance into the religion, particularly the nâmakara∫a, or 
naming rite. The most obvious sign of true sincerity of adoption or conversion is the total abandoning of the former name and the choosing of the Hindu name, usually the name of a God or Goddess, and then making it legal on one’s passport, identity card, social security card and driver’s li-cense. This is true sincerity and consid-ered by born members as the most honor-able and trusted testimony of those who choose to join the global congregation of the world’s oldest religion. The acceptance of outsiders into the Hindu fold has oc-curred for thousands of years. As Swâmî Vivekânanda once said, “Born aliens have been converted in the past by crowds, and the process is still going on.” Dr. S. Râdhâ-k®ish∫an confirms the swâmî’s views in a 
brief passage from his well known book The Hindu View of Life: “In a sense, Hindu-
ism may be regarded as the first example in the world of a missionary religion. Only its missionary spirit is different from that associated with the proselytizing creeds. It did not regard it as its mission to convert humanity to any one opinion. For what counts is conduct and not belief. Wor-shipers of different Gods and followers of different rites were taken into the Hindu fold. The ancient practice of vrâtyastoma, 
described fully in the Ta∫∂ya Brâhma∫a,  
shows that not only individuals but whole tribes were absorbed into Hinduism. Many modern sects accept outsiders. (p. 28-29).” See: Hinduism.
convert: T o change from one religion or philosophy to another. A person who has 
so changed.
council on missions:  preshana chakravâla,  
the administrative body of each Church mission. It consists of all kulapatis in the 
mission in conjunction with the Guru Mahâ sannidhânam and one or more 
swâmîs. One of its main functions is to 
serve as the formal channel of information to and from the Kailâsa Pî†ham at Kauai Aadheenam.
covenant: A binding agreement to do or 
keep from doing certain things. 
covet: T o want ardently, especially some-
thing belonging to another. T o envy.
cranial chakras: The âjñâ, or third-eye 
center, and the sahasrâra, at the top of the 
head near the pineal and pituitary glands. See: chakra.
creed: Íraddhâdhâra∫â. An authoritative 
formulation of the beliefs of a religion. Historically, creeds have arisen to protect doctrinal purity when religions are trans-planted into foreign cultures. 
cremation: Dahana. Burning of the dead. 
Cremation is the traditional system of disposing of bodily remains, having the positive effect of releasing the soul most quickly from any lingering attachment to the earth plane. In modern times, cre-mation facilities are widely available in nearly every country, though gas-fueled chambers generally take the place of the customary wood pyre. Embalming, com-monly practiced even if the body is to be cremated, is ill-advised, as it injures the astral body and can actually be felt by the departed soul, as would an autopsy. Should it be necessary to preserve the body a few days to allow time for relatives to arrive, it is recommended that hot ice surround the body and that the coffin be kept closed. Ar-rangements for this service should be made well in advance with the mortuary. Note that the remains of enlightened masters

dharma: 
∞º@ From dh®i , “to sustain; carry,

tains or upholds the cosmos.” Dharma is a 
complex and all-inclusive term with many meanings, including: divine law, law of be-
ing, way of righteousness, religion, duty, responsibility, virtue, justice, goodness and truth. Essentially, dharma is the or-
derly fulfillment of an inherent nature or destiny. Relating to the soul, it is the mode of conduct most conducive to spiritual ad-vancement, the right and righteous path. There are four principal kinds of dharma,  
as follows. 1) ®ita: “Universal law.” The in-
herent order of the cosmos. The laws of being and nature that contain and govern all forms, functions and processes, from gal axy clusters to the power of mental 
thought and perception. 2 ) var∫a  dharma :
 
“Law of one’s kind.” Social duty. Var∫a can 
mean “race, tribe, appearance, character, color, social standing, etc.” Var∫a dharma 
defines the individual’s obligations and responsibilities within the nation, society, community, class, occupational subgroup and family. An important part of this dhar-
ma is religious and moral law. 3 ) âßrama 
dharma:  “Duties of life’s stages.” Human 
dharma. The natural process of maturing 
from childhood to old age through ful-fillment of the duties of each of the four stages of life— brahmachârî  (student), 
g®ihastha (householder), vânaprastha (el-
der advisor) and sannyâsa (religious soli-
taire)—in pursuit of the four human goals: dharma (righteousness) , artha (wealth) , 
kâma  (pleasure) and moksha (liberation) . 
See: âßrama dharma. 4) svadharma : “Per-
sonal law.” One’s perfect individual pat-tern through life, according to one’s own particular phy  sical, mental and emotional 
nature. Svadharma is determined by the 
sum of past karmas and the cumulative 
effect of the other three dharmas. It is the 
individualized application of dharma, 
dependent on personal karma, reflected 
on one’s race, community, physical char-acteristics, health, intelligence, skills and aptitudes, desires and tendencies, religion,

“religion, dharma.” More specifically, it is 
the essential element of religion—the be-lief in phenomena beyond the pale of the five senses, distinguishing it sharply from rationalism. Faith is established through intuitive or transcendent experience of an individual, study of scripture and hear-ing the testimony of the many wise ®ishis 
speaking out the same truths over thou-sands of years. The Sansk®it equivalent is ßraddhâ.

It is a family of myriad faiths with four primary denominations: Íaivism, V aish∫avism, Íâk-tism and Smârtism. These four hold such divergent beliefs that each is a complete and independent religion. Y et, they share a vast heritage of culture and belief— kar-

Hinduism (Hindu Dharma): 
⁄“≥Æ‹∞º@ India’s 
indigenous religious and cultural system, followed today by nearly one billion ad-herents, mostly in India, but with large populations in many other countries. Also called Sanâtana Dhar ma, “eternal religion” 
and V aidika Dhar ma, “religion of the Ve -
das.” Hinduism is the world’s most ancient 
religion and encompasses a broad spec-trum of philosophies ranging from plu-ralistic theism to absolute monism. It is a family of myriad faiths with four primary denominations: Íaivism, V aish∫avism, Íâk-tism and Smârtism. These four hold such divergent beliefs that each is a complete and independent religion. Y et, they share a vast heritage of culture and belief— kar-
ma, dharma,  reincarnation, all-pervasive 
Divinity, temple worship, sacraments, manifold Deities, the guru-ßishya tradition 
and a reliance on the Veda s as scriptural 
authority.

Kailâsa: éÁƒŸ– “Crystalline” or “abode of 
bliss.” The four-faced Himalayan peak in Western Tibet; the earthly abode of Lord Íiva. Associated with Mount Meru, the leg-endary center of the universe, it is an im-portant pilgrimage destination for all Hin-dus, as well as for Tibetan Buddhists. Kai-lâsa is represented in Íâktism by a certain three-dimensional form of the Írî Chakra 
yantra (also called kailâsa chakra). 
Kailâsa Paramparâ:
 éÁƒŸ–¥¿ Ä¥¿Ÿ A spiritual 
lineage of siddhas , a major stream of the 
Nandinâtha Sampradâya, proponents of the ancient philosophy of monistic Íaiva Siddhânta. The first of these masters that history recalls was Maharishi Nandinâtha (or Nandikeßvara) 2,250 years ago, satguru  
to the great Tirumular, ca 200 bce, and seven other disciples (as stated in the Tiru-
mantiram): Patañjali, Vyâghrapâda, Sanat-
ku mâra, Íivayogamuni, Sanakar, Sanadan-
ar and Sananthanar. Tirumular had seven disciples: Mala˜gam, Indiran, Soman, Brahman, Rudran, Kal a˜ga, and Kañja-
mal a yam, each of whom established one 
or more monasteries and propagated the Ågamic lore. In the line of Kala˜ga came the sages ‰igh ama, Mâligaideva, Nâdân-
tar, Bho gadeva and Paramânanda. The lin-
eage continued down the centuries and is alive today—the first recent siddha  known 
being the ‰ishi from the Himalayas, so named because he des cended from those 
holy mountains. In South India, he initi-ated Kadait swâmî (ca  1810–1875), who in 
turn initiated Chellappaswâmî  (1840–1915). 
Chellappan passed the mantle of author-ity to sage Y ogaswâmî (1872–1964), who in 1949 initiated the current satguru, Sivaya 
Subramuniyaswami. See: Chell apa swâmî, 
Ka dait  swâmî, Nâtha Sampradâya, Subra-
muniyaswami, Tirumular, Yogaswâmî. 
kalâ– 64 (chatu˙ shash†i kalâ):  
ò™‹Å Œ⁄œ¢éƒŸ “Sixty-four arts.” A classical curriculum 
of sacred sciences, studies, arts and skills of cultured living listed in various Hindu ßâstras . Its most well-known appearance 
is in the Kâma Sûtra, an extensive manual 
devoted to sensual pleasures . The kalâs  
are among the skills traditionally taught to both genders, while emphasizing mas-culinity in men and femininity in women. Their subject matter draws on such texts as the Vedâ˜ga s and Upavedas, and the Íilpa 
Íâstras, or craft manuals. Through the cen-
turies, writers have prescribed many more skills and accomplishments. These include sculpture, pottery, weaving, astronomy and astrology, mathematics, weights and measures, philosophy, scriptural study, ag-riculture, navigation, trade and shipping, knowledge of time, logic, psychology and âyurveda. In modern times, two unique 
sets of 64 kalâs have been developed, one 
for girls and one for boys. 
Kali Yuga: 
é⁄ƒæ ‹í “Dark Age.” The Kali 
Yuga is the last age in the repetitive cycle of four phases of time the universe passes through. It is comparable to the darkest part of the night, as the forces of ignorance are in full power and many of the subtle faculties of the soul are obscured. See:  
yuga.

Kadaitswâmî: filapw;Rthkp  “Mar-
ketplace swâmî .” A satguru  of the 
Nandinâtha Sampradâya’s Kai lâsa 
Pa ram parâ. Born ca 1820; died 1875. Re-
nouncing his career as a judge in Banga-lore, South India, Kadait swâmî became a 
sannyâsin and trained under the “‰ishi 
from the Himâlayas,” who then sent him on mission to Sri Lanka. He performed severe tapas on an island off the coast of 
Jaffna, awakening many siddhis. For de-
cades he spurred the Sri Lankan Íaivites to greater spirituality through his inspired talks and demonstration of siddhis. He ini-
tiated Chellappaswâmî as the next satguru  
in the paramparâ. See: Kailâsa Paramparâ , 
Nâtha Sampradâya.
Kadavul:

bliss.” The four-faced Himalayan peak in Western Tibet; the earthly abode of Lord Íiva. Associated with Mount Meru, the leg-endary center of the universe, it is an im-portant pilgrimage destination for all Hin-dus, as well as for Tibetan Buddhists. Kai-lâsa is represented in Íâktism by a certain three-dimensional form of the Írî Chakra 
yantra (also called kailâsa chakra). 
Kailâsa Paramparâ:
 éÁƒŸ–¥¿ Ä¥¿Ÿ A spiritual 
lineage of siddhas , a major stream of the 
Nandinâtha Sampradâya, proponents of the ancient philosophy of monistic Íaiva Siddhânta. The first of these masters that history recalls was Maharishi Nandinâtha (or Nandikeßvara) 2,250 years ago, satguru  
to the great Tirumular, ca 200 bce, and seven other disciples (as stated in the Tiru-
mantiram): Patañjali, Vyâghrapâda, Sanat-
ku mâra, Íivayogamuni, Sanakar, Sanadan-
ar and Sananthanar. Tirumular had seven disciples: Mala˜gam, Indiran, Soman, Brahman, Rudran, Kal a˜ga, and Kañja-
mal a yam, each of whom established one 
or more monasteries and propagated the Ågamic lore. In the line of Kala˜ga came the sages ‰igh ama, Mâligaideva, Nâdân-
tar, Bho gadeva and Paramânanda. The lin-
eage continued down the centuries and is alive today—the first recent siddha  known 
being the ‰ishi from the Himalayas, so named because he des cended from those 
holy mountains. In South India, he initi-ated Kadait swâmî (ca  1810–1875), who in 
turn initiated Chellappaswâmî  (1840–1915). 
Chellappan passed the mantle of author-ity to sage Y ogaswâmî (1872–1964), who in 1949 initiated the current satguru, Sivaya 
Subramuniyaswami. See: Chell apa swâmî, 
Ka dait  swâmî, Nâtha Sampradâya, Subra-
muniyaswami, Tirumular, Yogaswâmî. 
kalâ– 64 (chatu˙ shash†i kalâ):  
ò™‹Å Œ⁄œ¢éƒŸ “Sixty-four arts.” A classical curriculum 
of sacred sciences, studies, arts and skills of cultured living listed in various Hindu ßâstras . Its most well-known appearance 
is in the Kâma Sûtra, an extensive manual 
devoted to sensual pleasures . The kalâs  
are among the skills traditionally taught to both genders, while emphasizing mas-culinity in men and femininity in women. Their subject matter draws on such texts as the Vedâ˜ga s and Upavedas, and the Íilpa 
Íâstras, or craft manuals. Through the cen-
turies, writers have prescribed many more skills and accomplishments. These include sculpture, pottery, weaving, astronomy and astrology, mathematics, weights and measures, philosophy, scriptural study, ag-riculture, navigation, trade and shipping, knowledge of time, logic, psychology and âyurveda. In modern times, two unique 
sets of 64 kalâs have been developed, one 
for girls and one for boys. 
Kali Yuga: 
é⁄ƒæ ‹í “Dark Age.” The Kali

liberation: Moksha , release from the bonds 
of pâßa, after which the soul is liberated 
from saμsâra (the round of births and

three-fold bondage of â∫ava, karma and 
mâyâ, which limit and confine the soul 
to the reincarnational cycle so that it may evolve. Moksha is freedom from the 
fettering power of these bonds, which do not cease to exist, but no longer have the power to fetter or bind the soul. See: mala, 
moksha, reincarnation, Self Realization, videha mukti.

Mahâbhârata: º“Ÿ∫Ÿ¿™ “Great Epic of In-
dia.” The world’s longest epic poem. It re-volves around the conflict between two kingdoms, the Pâ∫∂avas and Kauravas, and their great battle of Kurukshetra near modern Delhi in approximately 1424 
BCE. 
Woven through the plot are countless dis-courses on philosophy, religion, astronomy, cosmology, polity, economics and many stories illustrative of simple truths and ethical principles. The Bhagavad Gîtâ is 
one section of the work. The Mahâbhârata 
is revered as scripture by V aish∫avites and Smârtas. See: Bhagavad Gîtâ.
Mahâdeva: 
º“ŸÆ‰Δ “Great shining one; God.” 
Referring either to God Íiva or any of the highly evolved beings who live in the Íivaloka in their natural, effulgent soul bodies . God Íiva in His perfection as Pri-
mal Soul is one of the Mahâdevas, yet He is unique and incomparable in that He alone is uncreated, the Father-Mother and Des-tiny of all other Mahâdevas. He is called Parameßvara, “Supreme God.” He is the Pri-mal Soul, whereas the other Gods are indi-vidual souls. See: Gods, Parameßvara, Íiva.
mahâpralaya: 
º“Ÿ¥˘ƒæ “Great dissolution.” 
T otal annihilation of the universe at the end of a mahâkalpa. It is the absorption 
of all existence, including time, space and individual consciousness, all the lokas and 
their inhabitants into God Íiva, as the wa-ter of a river returns to its source, the sea. 
Then Íiva alone exists in His three perfec-tions, until He again issues forth creation. During this incredibly vast period there are many partial dissolutions, pralayas , 
when either the Bhûloka and/or the Antar-loka are destroyed.

Mahâßivarâtri: 
º“Ÿ⁄ÀΔ¿Ÿ⁄& “Íiva’s great 
night.” Íaivism’s foremost festival, cel-ebrated on the night before the new moon in February-March. Fasting and all-night vigil are observed as well as other disci-plines: chanting, praying, meditating and worshiping Íiva as the Source and Self of all that exists.

U .), Tat tvam asi (“Thou art That” —Çhando-
gya U .) and Ayam âtma Brahma (“The soul 
is God”— Mâ∫∂ûkya U .).

monastic: A monk or nunk (based on the 
Greek monos, “alone”). A man or woman 
who has withdrawn from the world and lives an austere, religious life, either alone or with others in a monastery. (Not to be confused with monistic, having to 
do with the doctrine of monism.) A mon-astery-dweller is a ma†havâsi, and sâdhu

nism is the doctrine that reality is a one whole or existence without independent parts. Theism is the belief that God ex-ists as a real, conscious, personal Su-preme Being. Monistic theism is the di-polar doctrine, also called panentheism, that embraces both monism and theism, two perspectives ordinarily considered contra dictory or mutually exclusive, since 
theism implies dualism. Monistic theism simultaneously accepts that God has a per-sonal form, that He creates, pervades and is all that exists—and that He ultimately 
transcends all existence and that the soul is, in essence, one with God. See: advaita, 
Advaita Èßvaravâda, Advaita Siddhânta, theism.

nâ chitta (“mind of subliminal traits”). 
The area of the subconscious mind formed when two thoughts or experiences of the same rate of intensity are sent into the subconscious at different times and, inter-mingling, give rise to a new and totally dif-ferent rate of vibration. This subconscious formation later causes the external mind to react to situations according to these accumulated vibrations, be they positive, negative or mixed. •superconscious mind:

the basic needs—food, money, clothing and shelter—and extends to the wealth required to maintain a comfortable home, raise a family, fulfill a successful career and perform religious duties. The broad-est concept of wealth embraces financial independence, freedom from debt, worthy children, good friends, leisure time, faith-ful servants, trustworthy employees, and the joys of giving, including tithing ( daßa-
mâmsha), feeding the poor, supporting re-
ligious mendicants, worshiping devoutly, protecting all creatures, upholding the family and offering hospitality to guests. See: yajña. •kâma:  “Pleasure, love; enjoy-
ment.” Earthly love, aesthetic and cultural fulfillment, pleasures of the world (includ-ing sexual), the joys of family, intellectual satisfaction. Enjoyment of happiness, se-curity, creativity, usefulness and inspira-tion.  •moksha:  “Lib  era tion.” Freedom from 
rebirth through the ultimate attainment, realization of the Self God, Paraßiva. The spiritual attainments and supercon scious 
joys, attending renunciation and yoga 
leading to Self Realization. Moksha comes 
through the fulfillment of dharma, artha 
and kâma (known in Tamil as aram, porul 
and inbam, and explained by Tiruvalluvar 
in Tirukural)  in the current or past lives, 
so that one is no longer attached to worldly joys or sorrows.  See: liberation, moksha.

kalpa samâdhi (“enstasy with form or 
seed”), identification or oneness with the essence of an object. Its highest form is the realization of the primal substratum or pure consciousness, Satchidânanda. The second is nirvi kalpa samâdhi  (“enstasy

pradâya is thus a philosophy borne down 
through history by verbal transmission. It is more inclusive than the related term paramparâ which names a living lineage

—garbhâdhâna:  “Womb-placing.” Rite of 
revelations contained in the twenty-eight 
Íaiva Ågamas . The first known guru of the 
Íuddha (“pure”) Íaiva Siddhânta tradition was Maharishi Nandinâtha of Kashmir (ca bce 250), recorded in Pâ∫ini’s book of grammar as the teacher of ®ishis Patañjali, 
Vyâ ghrapâda and V asish†ha. Other sacred 
scriptures include the Tirumantiram and 
the voluminous  collection of devotional 
hymns, the Tirumurai, and the masterpiece 
on ethics and statecraft, the Tirukural . For 
Íaiva Siddhântins,  Íiva is the totality of 
all, understood in three perfections: Para-m eßvara (the Personal Creator Lord), Para-
ßakti (the substratum of form) and Paraßi-va (Absolute Reality which transcends all). Souls and world are identical in essence with Íiva, yet also differ in that they are evolving. A pluralistic stream arose in the middle ages from the teachings of Agho-raßiva and Meykandar. For Aghoraßiva’s school (ca 1150) Íiva is not the material cause of the universe, and the soul attains perfect “sameness” with Íiva upon lib-eration. Meykandar’s (ca 1250) pluralistic school denies that souls ever attain perfect sameness or unity with Íiva. See: Íaivism.

Íaivism (Íaiva): 
ÀÊΔ The religion followed 
by those who worship Íiva as supreme God. Oldest of the four sects of Hinduism. The earliest historical evidence of Íaivism is from the 8,000-year-old Indus V alley civilization in the form of the famous seal of Íiva as Lord Paßupati, seated in a yogic 
pose. In the Râmâ ya∫a , dated astronomi-
cally at 2000 bce, Lord Râma worshiped Íiva, as did his rival Râva∫a. Buddha in 624 bce was born into a Íaivite family, and re-

love), kriyâ ßakti  (the power of action) and 
jñâna ßakti  (the power of wisdom, know-
ing), represented as the three prongs of Íi-va’s trißûla, or trident. From these arise the 
five powers of revealment, concealment, dissolution, preservation and creation. In Íaiva Siddhânta, Íiva is All, and His divine energy, Íakti, is inseparable from Him. This unity is symbolized in the im-age of Ardhanârîßvara, “half-female God.” In popular, village Hinduism, the unity of Íiva and Íakti is replaced with the concept

world. Transmigratory existence, fraught with impermanence and change. The cycle of birth, death and rebirth; the total pattern of successive earthly lives experi-enced by a soul . 
saμskâra: 
–Ä—éŸ¿ “Impression, activator; 
sanctification, preparation.” 1) The im-prints left on the subconscious mind by experience (from this or previous lives), which then color all of life, one’s nature, responses, states of mind, etc. 2) A sacra-ment or rite done to mark a significant transition of life. These make deep and positive impressions on the mind of the re-cipient, inform the family and community of changes in the lives of its members and secure inner-world blessings. See: mind 
(five states), sacrament.  
saμskâras of birth:  From the rite of concep-
tion to the blessings of the new-born child.  
—garbhâdhâna:  “Womb-placing.” Rite of 
revelations contained in the twenty-eight 
Íaiva Ågamas . The first known guru of the 
Íuddha (“pure”) Íaiva Siddhânta tradition was Maharishi Nandinâtha of Kashmir (ca bce 250), recorded in Pâ∫ini’s book of grammar as the teacher of ®ishis Patañjali, 
Vyâ ghrapâda and V asish†ha. Other sacred 
scriptures include the Tirumantiram and 
the voluminous  collection of devotional 
hymns, the Tirumurai, and the masterpiece 
on ethics and statecraft, the Tirukural . For 
Íaiva Siddhântins,  Íiva is the totality of 
all, understood in three perfections: Para-m eßvara (the Personal Creator Lord), Para-
ßakti (the substratum of form) and Paraßi-va (Absolute Reality which transcends all). Souls and world are identical in essence with Íiva, yet also differ in that they are evolving. A pluralistic stream arose in the middle ages from the teachings of Agho-raßiva and Meykandar. For Aghoraßiva’s school (ca 1150) Íiva is not the material cause of the universe, and the soul attains perfect “sameness” with Íiva upon lib-eration. Meykandar’s (ca 1250) pluralistic school denies that souls ever attain perfect sameness or unity with Íiva. See: Íaivism.
Íaiva Siddhânta Church:

Íaiva Siddhânta Yoga Order:  Ecclesiastical 
body of  lifetime renunciate swâmîs. This 
sa˜gam was founded by Satguru Sivaya 
Subramuniyaswami in 1949.
Íaivism (Íaiva): 
ÀÊΔ The religion followed 
by those who worship Íiva as supreme God. Oldest of the four sects of Hinduism. The earliest historical evidence of Íaivism is from the 8,000-year-old Indus V alley civilization in the form of the famous seal of Íiva as Lord Paßupati, seated in a yogic 
pose. In the Râmâ ya∫a , dated astronomi-
cally at 2000 bce, Lord Râma worshiped Íiva, as did his rival Râva∫a. Buddha in 624 bce was born into a Íaivite family, and re-
cords of his time speak of the Íaiva ascet-ics who wandered the hills looking much as they do today.

Íakti: 
À⁄è™ “Power, energy.” The active pow-
er or manifest energy of Íiva that pervades all of existence. Its most refined aspect is Parâßakti, or Satchidânanda, the pure con-sciousness and primal substratum of all form. This pristine, divine energy unfolds as icçhâ ßakti  (the power of desire, will, 
love), kriyâ ßakti  (the power of action) and 
jñâna ßakti  (the power of wisdom, know-
ing), represented as the three prongs of Íi-va’s trißûla, or trident. From these arise the 
five powers of revealment, concealment, dissolution, preservation and creation. In Íaiva Siddhânta, Íiva is All, and His divine energy, Íakti, is inseparable from Him. This unity is symbolized in the im-age of Ardhanârîßvara, “half-female God.” In popular, village Hinduism, the unity of Íiva and Íakti is replaced with the concept

the weekly bhajana  and the monthly ha-
vana satsa˜ga s. The bhajana satsa˜ga  has 
three variations per year in accordance with the three climatic seasons: Nartana, Jîvana and Moksha ®itaus . 
Sat Yuga: 
–™Î æ‹íÎ The first in the repetitive 
cycle of yugas , representing the brightest 
time, when the power of Íiva is felt most easily by all. See: yuga.
scripture (scriptural): “ A writing.”  A sacred 
text or holy book having authority for a given sect or religion. See: ßâstra, sm®iti, 
ßruti.
secluded (seclusion): Isolated; hidden. Kept 
apart from others. See: muni.
Second W orld:  The astral or subtle plane. 
Here the soul continues its activities in the astral body during sleep and after the physical body dies. It is the in-between world which includes the Devaloka and the Narakaloka. The Second world exists “within” the First World or physical plane. See: loka.  
secular humanism: A system that rejects 
religious faith and worship and holds that one need not look beyond man for life’s ethical meaning.
secular: -Not sacred or religious; temporal 
or worldly.
seer:  Visionary; ®ishi. A wise being or mys-
tic who sees beyond the limits of ordinary perception. See: âkâßa, ®ishi.
self-assertive:  Quality of one who makes himself, his ideas, opinions, etc., dominant. 
Demanding recognition.
Self (Self God):  God Íiva’s perfection of Ab-
solute Reality, Paraßiva—That which abides at the core of every soul. See: Param âtman, 
Paraßiva .
self-declared sannyâsin: Paramadeßî san-
nyâsin. See: sannyâsa dîkshâ.

or eradicating the personal ego and the dross of the past, lodged in the memory patterns of the subconscious.
Self Realization: Direct knowing of the Self 
God, Paraßiva. Self Realization is known in Sansk®it as nirvikalpa samâdhi;  “en-
stasy without form or seed;” the ultimate spiritual attainment (also called asampra-
jñata sa mâdhi). Esoterically, this state is 
attained when the mystic ku∫∂alinî force 
pierces through the sahasrâra chakra at 
the crown of the head. See: God Realiza-
tion, liberation, ku∫∂alinî, Paraßiva, râja yoga, samâdhi.
seminary:  A recognized theological center 
for training monks. Kauai Aadheenam is the seminary of Íaiva Siddhânta Church.
senior minority group:  The one-third most 
senior members of the monastery. They meet regularly, in private, to oversee clean-liness, general procedures and the flow of guests and act as a channel to the guru 
and convey his instructions to the monas-tery in a formal way. .
seniority age:  Age in Íaiva Siddhânta 
Church calculated by adding together physical age, nâmakara∫a  age and mem-
bership age.
sepulcher: A burial vault; grave; tomb. In 
Sansk®it, known as a samâdhi.
servitude: 
Condition of a slave subject to a 
master. 
under age 25 and who otherwise meet strict qualifications. Alternately, the house-holder may embrace sannyâsa dharma  by 
entering the  sannyâsa âßrama  after age 
72 through the customary initiatory rites given by a sannyâsin and then diligently 
pursuing his spiritual sâdhana in a state of 
genuine renunciation and not in the midst of his family. These two forms of sannyâsa 
are not to be confused with simply enter-ing the sannyâsa âßrama, the last stage of 
life. See:  sannyâsa, sannyâsa dîkshâ, san-
nyâsin, videhamukti. 
sannyâsa dîkshâ:
 –Ä≥æŸ–Æ¤’Ÿ “Renunciate 
initiation.” This dîkshâ is a formal rite, or 
less often an informal blessing, entering the devotee into renunciate monasticism, binding him for life to certain vows which include chastity, poverty and obedience, and directing him on the path to Self Re-alization. An unordained, self-declared swâmî , who dons the ochre robes and 
throws down the world without the ben-efit of dîkshâ , is a paramadeßî sannyâsin, 
“monk outside the rules or ordinances.” These are men who recognized that when the time is ripe, that’s who you are. See: sannyâsa dharma, videhamukti. 
Sannyâsa Upanishad: 
–~≥æŸ– Ü¥⁄≤ŒÆ Í An 
Upanishad of the Atharva Veda . It deals 
with the transition  to the vânaprastha and 
sannyâsa âßramas.
sannyâsin: –Ä≥æŸ⁄–≤ Î “Renouncer.” One who 
has taken sannyâsa dîkshâ . A Hindu monk, 
swâmî, and one of a world brotherhood (or 
holy order) of sannyâsins . See: swâmî. 
ßânti: ÀŸ⁄≥™ “Peace.” 
Sansk®it: –Ä—é‚™ “Well-made; perfected.” The 
classical sacerdotal language of ancient India, considered a pure vehicle for com-munication with the celestial worlds. It is the primary language in which Hindu scriptures are written, including the Veda s 
and Ågamas. Employed today as a liturgi-
cal, literary and scholarly language, but no longer used as a spoken tongue. 
Íânti Mantra:  
ÀŸ⁄≥™ º≥& “Peace chant.” So 
that each gathering of devotees is harmoni-ous and productive, especially sessions of teacher and student, this mantra from the 
Taitti rîya Upanishad (2.1.1) is recited at the 
outset to invoke peace, clarity and divine blessings, thus dispelling all potential en-mity or confusion. It is recited again at the end as a closing benediction. It is re cited 
in the knowledge that through harmony of will and mind, superconscious ideas and insights will flood forth. 
Saravanabhava lake: Lake in the ‰ishi V al-
ley section of San Mârga named after the holy lake of Lord Murugan. Its mirror-like surface symbolizes a quieted, peaceful mind.
sârî: (Hindi, 
–Ÿ•˛¤) The traditional outer gar-
ment of a Hindu woman, consisting of a long, unstitched piece of cloth, usually col-orful cotton or silk, wrapped around the body, forming an ankle-length skirt, and around the bosom and over the shoulder. 
ßâstra: 
ÀŸ—& “Sacred text; teaching.” 1) Any 
religious or philosophical treatise, or body of writings. 2) A department of knowledge, a science; e.g., the Dharma Íâstras on reli-
gious law, Artha Íâstras on politics.
ßâstrî: 
ÀŸ—&¤ One who is knowledgeable in 
ßâstra,  or scriptures.
Íâstric flow:  The patterns and systems de-
lineated in the Lord Subramaniam Íâstras.  
The psychic, mental and physical environ-ment created through adhering to these principles and guidelines.
satguru (sadguru): 
–ØÓ‹¡ “True weighty 
one.” A spiritual preceptor of the highest attainment—one who has realized the ul-timate Truth, Paraßiva, through nirvikalpa 
samâdhi —a jîvanmukta able to lead others 
securely along the spiritual path. He is al-ways a sannyâsin , an unmarried renunci-
ate. All Hindu denominations teach that the grace and guidance of a living satguru

GlossaryÍivâchârya: ⁄ÀΔŸòŸæ @ The hereditary priests 
of the Íaiva Siddhânta tradition. The title of Ådißaiva Brâhmins. An Ådißaiva priest who has received the necessary training and dîkshâs  to perform public Íiva temple 
rites  known as Ågamic nitya parârtha 
pûjâ . A fully qualified Íivâchârya is also 
known as archaka. Íivâchârya, too, names 
the family clan of this priest tradition. See: brâhmin.
Íiva consciousness: Íivachaitanya. A broad 
term naming the experience or state of being conscious of Íiva in a multitude of ways, such as in the five expressed in the following meditation. Vital Breath:  prâ∫a. 
Experience the inbreath and outbreath as Íiva’s will within the body. Become at-tuned to the ever-present pulse of the uni-verse, knowing that nothing moves but by His divine will. All-Pervasive Energy:  
ßakti. Become conscious of the flow of 
life within the body. Realize that it is the same universal energy within every liv-ing thing. Practice seeing the life energy within another’s eyes. Manifest Sacred 
Form:  darßana. Hold in your mind a sa-
cred form, such as Na†arâja, Íivali˜ga or the sat guru —who is Sadâßiva—and think 
of nothing else. See every form as a form of our God Íiva. Inner Light:  jyoti. Observe 
the light that illumines the thoughts. Con-centrate only on that light, as you might practice being more aware of the light on a TV screen than of its changing pictures. Sacred Sound:  nâda. Listen to the constant 
high-pitched ee sounding in the head. It is 
like the tone of an electrical transformer, a hundred tamburas distantly playing or a 
humming swarm of bees. See: jñâna, mind 
(five states). 
Íivadhyâna:
 ⁄ÀΔ±æŸ≤ Meditation on Íiva.
Íivali˜ga: ⁄ÀΔ⁄ƒó Ó “Mark, or sign, of Íiva.” 
The most prevalent icon of Íiva, found in virtually all Íiva temples. A rounded, el-liptical, aniconic image, usually set on a circular base, or pî†ha. The Íivali˜ga is the 
simplest and most ancient symbol of Íiva, especially of Paraßiva, God beyond all forms and qualities. The pî†ha represents 
Parâ ßakti, the manifesting power of God. 
Li˜gas are usually of stone (either carved or naturally existing, svayam bhû, such as 
shaped by a swift-flowing river), but may also be of metal, precious gems, crystal, wood, earth or transitory materials such as ice. See: mûrti, Íaivism.
Íivaloka: 
⁄ÀΔƒËé “Realm of Íiva.” See: 
loka.
Sivanadiyar:  rptdoahh “Slave of Íiva.” 
Conveys a mystic relationship between the devotee and Íiva in which all spiritual, mental and physical actions are perceived as fulfilling the will and design of Íiva. See: karma yoga.
Íivarâtri: 
⁄ÀΔ¿Ÿ⁄& “Night of Íiva.” See: Ma-
hâ ßivarâtri.
Íiva-Íakti: ⁄ÀΔÀ⁄# Father-Mother God, 
both immanent and transcendent. A name for God Íiva encompassing His unmani-fest Being and manifest energy. See: Ard-
hanârîßvara, Parameßvara, Primal Soul, Íiva.
Sivathondan: 
rptbjhz;ld “Servant of 
Íiva.” Conveys the same mystic meaning as Sivanadiyar, denoting a devotee who regu-larly performs actions dedicated to God Íiva; selfless work in service to others. See: karma yoga.
Sivathondu: 
rptbjhz;L  “Service to Íiva.” 
Akin to the concept of karma yoga.  See:

One of Lord Kârttikeya’s oldest names, and His form as scarlet-hued warrior God. See: Kârttikeya.
Skanda Íash†hî:
 —é≥ÆŒœ§¤ A six-day festi-
val in October-November celebrating Lord 
seva –‰Δ “Service.” Karma yoga. An integral 
part of the spiritual path, where the aspi-rant strives to serve without thought of reward or personal gain. The central prac-tice of the charyâ pâda . See: yoga.
severance: A breaking off or separation. 
sexuality: Hinduism has a healthy, unre-
pressed outlook on human sexuality, and sexual pleasure is part of kâma, one of the 
four goals of life. On matters such as birth control, sterilization, masturbation, ho-mosexuality, bisexuality, petting and poly-gamy, Hindu scripture is tolerantly silent, neither calling them sins nor encouraging their practice, neither condemning nor con doning. The two important exceptions 
to this understanding view of sexual expe-rience are adultery and abortion, both of which are considered to carry heavy kar-
mic implications for this and future births. 
shirk: T o neglect or evade doing something 
that should be done.
shrouded: Covered, protected, screened, 
veiled, sheltered.
Shum: A Nâtha mystical language of medi-
tation revealed in Switzerland in 1968 by Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. Its primary al-phabet looks like this: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = q w e r t y
shun: T o keep away from; ignore or avoid 
scrupulously or consistently.
siddha: ⁄–ØÛ A “perfected one’’ or accom-
plished yogî, a person of great spiritual at-
tainment or powers. See: siddhi. 
siddhânta: ⁄–ØÛŸ≥™ “Final attainments or 
conclusions.” Siddhânta refers to ultimate 
understanding arrived at in any given field of knowledge. See: Íaiva Siddhânta.
Siddhânta Press:  The former name of 
Himâlayan Academy Publications, used in the Íaivite Íâstras . 
siddhi: 
⁄–⁄ØÛ “Power, accomplishment; per-
fection.” Extraordinary powers of the soul, developed through consistent meditation and deliberate, grueling, often uncomfort-
able tapas, or awakened naturally through 
spiritual maturity and yogic sâdhana . 
Through the repeated experience of Self Realization, siddhis naturally unfold ac-
cording to the needs of the individual. Before Self Realization, the use or devel-opment of siddhis is among the greatest 
obstacles on the path because it cultivates ahaμkâra, I-ness, and militates against the 
attainment of prapatti, complete submis-
sion to the will of God, Gods and guru.
sin: Intentional transgression of divine law. 
Akin to the Latin sous,  “guilty.” Hinduism 
does not view sin as a crime against God, but as an act against dharma —moral or-
der—and one’s own self. It is thought nat-ural, if unfortunate, that young souls act wrongly, for they are living in nescience, avidya, the darkness of ignorance. Sin is 
an adharmic  course of action which auto-
matically brings negative consequences. The term sin carries a double meaning, as 
do its Sansk®it equivalents: 1) a wrongful act, 2) the negative consequences resulting from a wrongful act. In Hinduism, there are no such concepts as inherent  or mortal 
sin. See: aura, evil, karma, pâpa. 
ßishya: 
⁄Àœæ “ A pupil or disciple,” especially 
one who has proven himself and has for-mally been accepted by a guru . 
Íiva: 
⁄ÀΔ “The auspicious, gracious or 
kindly one.” Supreme Being of the Íaivite religion. God Íiva is All and in all, simulta-neously the creator and the creation, both immanent and transcendent. As personal Deity, He is creator, preserver and destroy-er. He is a one being, perhaps best under-stood in three perfections: Parameßvara (Primal Soul), Parâßakti (pure con scious-
ness) and Paraßiva (Absolute Reality). See: Parameßvara, Parâßakti, Paraßiva, 
Na†arâja, Íaivism .

ßruti:  
Ã˘‹⁄™ “That which is heard.” Hinduism’s 
revealed scriptures, of supreme theologi-cal authority and spiritual value. They are timeless teachings transmitted to ®ishis , or 
seers, directly by God thousands of years ago. Íruti is thus said to be apaurusheya, 
“impersonal.” Íruti consists of the Veda s  
and the Ågamas , preserved through oral 
tradition and eventually written down in Sansk®it. Among the many sacred books of the Hindus, these two bodies of knowledge 
are held in the highest esteem. For count-less centuries ßruti has been the basis of 
philosophical discussion, study and com-mentary, and this attention has given rise to countless schools of thought. It is also the subject of deep study and meditation, to realize the wisdom of the ancients with-in oneself. Most mantras are drawn from

suicide: “Self-killing.” In Sansk®it, prâ∫a-
tyâga, “abandoning life force.” Intentional-

drowning, burning, jumping, shooting, etc. 
Suicide has traditionally been condemned 
in Hindu scripture because, being an 
abrupt escape from life, it creates unseem-
ly kar ma to face in the future. However, 
in cases of terminal disease or great dis-
ability, religious self-willed death through 
fasting— prâyopaveßa— is permitted. The 
person making such a decision declares 
it publicly, which allows for community 
regulation and distinguishes the act from 
suicide performed privately in traumatic 
emotional states of anguish and despair. 
Ancient lawgivers cite various stipulations: 
1) inability to perform normal bodily pu-
rification; 2) death appears imminent or 
the condition is so bad that life’s pleasures 
are nil; 3) the action must be done under 
community regulation. The gradual nature 
of prâyopaveßa is a key factor distinguish-
ing it from sudden suicide, svadehaghata 
(“murdering one’s body”) , for it allows 
time for the individual  to settle  all differ-ences with others, to ponder life and draw 
close to God, as well as for loved ones to 
oversee the person’s gradual exit from the 
physical world. In the ideal, highly ritu-
alized practice, one begins by obtaining 
forgiveness and giving forgiveness. Next 
a formal vow, mahâ vrata-marana,  “great 
vow of death,” is given to one’s guru, fol-
lowing a full discussion of all karmas of 
this life, especially fully and openly con-
fessing one’s wrongdoings. Thereafter, at-
tention is to be focused on scripture and 
the guru’s noble teachings. Meditation on 
the innermost, immortal Self becomes the 
full focus as one gradually abstains from 
food. At the very end, as the soul releases 
itself from the body, the sacred mantra is 
repeated as instructed by the preceptor.

Tirumurai: jpUKiw “Holy book.” A 
twelve-book collection  of hymns and writ-
ings of South Indian Íaivite saints, com-
piled by Saint Nambiyandar Nambi (ca 
1000). Of these, books 1-3 are the hymns of 
Saint Tirujñâna Sambandar (ca 600). Books 
4-6 are the hymns of Saint Tirunavakarasu 
(Appar), a contemporary of Sambandar. 
Book 7 contains the hymns of Saint Sun-
daramûrti (ca 800). Book 8 contains the 
two works of Saint Man ik  kavasagar (9th 
century)— Tiruvasagam and Tirukovaiyar . 
Book 9 is the Tiruvisaippa and Tiruppal-
landu, which together comprise the works 
of nine saints. Book 10 is the Tirumantiram 
of Saint Tirumular (ca  200 bce). Book 11 
contains the hymns of ten saints, including 
Saint Nakkirar and Nambiyandar Nambi, 
the compiler.  Book 12 is the Periyapurâ∫am 
by Saint Sekkilar (11th century), narrat-
ing the life story of the 63 Íaiva Nayanar 
saints . The first seven books are known as 
Devarams. 
tiruneri: “Holy path,”  The straight, 
300-foot-long pathway through hibiscus

ßrî pâdukâ . The guru’s feet are especially 
sacred, being the point of contact of the di-
vine and physical spheres. See: pâdukâ.
Tiruvalluvar: jpUts;Sth  “Holy weaver.” 
Tamil weaver and householder saint (ca 
200 bce) who wrote the classic Íaivite ethi-
cal scripture Tirukural. See: Tirukural . 
tithing: Daßamâμßa. “One-tenth sharing.” 
The spiritual discipline, often a vrata, of 
treme penance, religious austerity and 
mortification. By comparison, sâdhana is 
austerity of a simple, sustained kind, while 
tapas is austerity of a severe, psyche-trans-
forming nature. Tapas is extreme bodily 
mortification, long term sâdhanas, such as 
meditating under a tree in one place for 12 
years, taking a lifetime vow of silence and 
never speaking or writing, or standing on 
one leg for a prescribed number of years. 
Scriptures generally warn against extreme 
asceticism which would bring harm to the 
body. 2) On a deeper level, tapas is the in-
tense inner state of ku∫∂alinî “fire” which 
stimulates mental anguish and separates 
the individual from society. Life does not 
go on as usual when this condition occurs. 
The association with a satguru, Sadâßiva, 
brings the devotee into tapas, and it brings 
him out of it. The fire of tapas burns on the 
dross of sañchita karmas.  This is the source 
of heat, dismay, depression and striving un-
til the advent of final and total surrender, 
prapatti . The individual can mollify this 
heated condition by continuing his regular 
sâdhana as outlined by the guru. The fires 
of self-transformation may be stimulated 
by the practice of tapas, or come unbidden. 
One can “do” tapas, but the true tapas is 
a condition of being and consciousness 
which is a state of grace, bringing positive 
change, transformation and purification of 
one’s nature. Guru bhakti  is the only force 
that can cool the fires of tapas.

Veda (s): Δ‰Æ “Wisdom.” Sagely revelations 
which comprise Hinduism’s most au-

Ågamas, are ßruti, “that which is heard.” 
The Veda s are a body of dozens of holy 
texts known collectively as the Veda, or as 
the four Vedas: ‰ig, Yajur, Sâma and Athar-
va. In all they include over 100,000 verses, 
as well as additional prose. Each Veda  has 
four sections: Saμhitâs (hymn collections), 
Brâhma∫as (priestly manuals),  Åra∫yakas 
(forest treatises) and Upanishads (enlight-
ened discourses) . See: ßruti, Upanishad.
Vedânta: Δ‰ÆŸ≥™ “Ultimate wisdom” or “fi-
nal conclusions of the Veda s.” Ve  dânta is 
the system of thought embodied in the 
Upanishads (ca 1500-600 bce) , which give 
forth the ultimate conclusions of the Veda s . 
Through history there developed numer-
ous V edânta schools, ranging from pure 
dualism to absolute monism. The first 
and original school is Advaita Èsvaravâda, 
“monistic theism” or panentheism, exem-
plified in the V edânta-Siddhânta of ‰ishi 
Tirumular (ca 250 bce) of the Nandinâtha 
Sampradâya in his Tirumantiram, which

who have freed themselves from worldly 
desires. See: monk, sannyâsa, tyâga.
vairâgya: ΔÊ¿Ÿìæ “Dispassion; aversion.” 
Freedom from passion. Distaste or disgust 
for worldliness because of spiritual awak-
ening. Also, the constant renunciation of 
obstacles on the path to liberation. Ascetic 
or monastic life.
vaish∫ava: ΔÊœ®Δ Of or relating to Vish∫u;

Vaish∫avism (Vaish∫ava): ΔÊœ®Δ One of the 
four major religions, or denominations of 
Hinduism, representing roughly half of 
the world’s one billion Hindus. It gravitates 
around the worship of Lord Vish∫u as Per-
sonal God, His incarnations and their con-
sorts. V aish∫avism stresses the personal 
aspect of God over the impersonal, and 
bhakti (devotion) as the true path to salva-
tion. The goal of V aish∫avism is the attain-
ment of mukti , defined as blissful union 
with God’s body, the loving recognition 
that the soul is a part of Him, and eternal 
nearness to Him in V aiku∫†ha, heaven. 
Foremost among V aish∫ava scriptures are 
the Vai sh ∫ava Ågamas, Râmâyana, Bhaga-
vad Gîtâ and Bhâgavata Purâ∫a.
Vaish∫avite: Of or relating to Vish∫u; same

incarnations. See: Vai sh ∫avism .
vaißya: ΔÊÕæ “Landowner; merchant.” The 
social class of bankers, businessmen, in-

Vârâ∫asî:  ΔŸ¿Ÿ®–¤ Also known as Kâßî  or Banâras. One of the most holy of Íaivite 
cities, and among the oldest cities in the 
world. Located in North India on the Gan-
ges River. Hindus consider it highly sanc-
tifying to die in Kâßî,  revering it as a gate-
way to moksha .
var∫a  dharma: Δ®@∞º@ “The way of one’s 
kind.” The hereditary social class system, 
generally referred to as caste,  established 
in India in ancient times . Within var∫a 
dharma  are the many religious and moral 
codes which define human virtue. Var∫a 
dharma is social duty, in keeping with the 
principles of good conduct, according to 
one’s community, which is generally based 
on the craft or occupation of the family. 
Strictly speaking it encompasses two inter-
related social hierarchies: 1) var∫a, which 
refers to the four classes: brâhmin, kshatri-
ya, vaißya and ßûdra; and 2 ) jâti, the myriad 
occupational subgroups, or guilds, which 
in India number over 3,000. Hence this 
dharma  is sometimes called jâti dharma. 
The class-caste system is still very much 
a part of Indian life today. Many modern 
Hindus propose that social status is now 
(and was originally) more properly deter-
mined by a person’s skills and accomplish-
ments than by birth. Mobility between 
jâtis, or castes, within Hindu communities 
worldwide is limited but not impossible, 
and is accomplished through marrying 
into a new jâti, or changing professions 
through persistence, skill and education. 
Íâstrîs say that once a person breaks out 
of his var∫a or jâti of birth and changes 
“caste,” it takes three generations for his 
family to become fully established in that 
new strata of society, provided the continu-
ity is unbroken. •var∫a: The four var∫as 
are as follows. •brâhmin (brâhma∫a): “Ma-

It is ultimate union of the individual soul body with the body of Íiva—Parameßvara—within the Íivaloka, from whence the soul was first emanated. This occurs at the end of the soul’s evolution, after the four outer sheaths ( annamaya koßa, prâ∫amaya koßa, 
mano maya koßa and vijñâmaya koßa) have 
been dropped off. Finally, ânandamaya 
koßa,  the soul form itself, merges in the 
Primal Soul. Individuality is lost as the soul becomes Íiva, the creator, preserver, destroyer, veiler and revealer. Individual identity expands into universality. Hav-ing previously merged in Paraßiva and Parâßakti in states of samâdhi, the soul 
now fully merges into Parameßvara and is one with all three of Íiva’s perfections. Jîva 
has totally become Íiva—not a new and in-dependent Íiva, as might be construed, for there is and can only be one Supreme God Íiva. This fulfilled merger can happen at the moment the physical body is dropped off, or after eons of time following further unfoldment of the higher chakras in the 
inner worlds—all depending on the matu-rity, ripe ness and intentions of the soul, by 
which is meant the advanced soul’s choice to be either an upadeßî, a liberated soul 
who continues helping others, or a nirvâ∫î,  
one who shuns all worldly involvement.

inner worlds—all depending on the matu-rity, ripe ness and intentions of the soul, by 
which is meant the advanced soul’s choice to be either an upadeßî, a liberated soul 
who continues helping others, or a nirvâ∫î,  
one who shuns all worldly involvement.
Vivekânanda, Swâmî: 
⁄ΔΔ‰éŸ≤≥Æ Disciple of 
Írî Râmak®ish∫a who was overtaken by an ardent love of Hinduism and a missionary zeal that drove him onward. He attained mahâsamâdhi at age 39 (1863– 1902). Most 
notable among his achievements was a trip around the world on which he gave brilliant lectures, especially in Europe and America, that created much respect for Hinduism. In India he founded the Râma-k®ish∫a Mission which thrives today inter-nationally with over 100 centers and nearly 1,000 sannyâ sins. He is credited, along with 
Tagore, Aurobindo, Râdhâk®ish∫an and others, with sparking the modern Hindu revival.
